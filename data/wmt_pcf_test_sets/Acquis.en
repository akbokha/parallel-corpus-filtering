Whereas the Principality of Liechtenstein has expressed the desire that all the provisions of that Agreement should apply to it,
The Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation signed on 22 July 1972 shall likewise apply to the Principality of Liechtenstein.
For the purpose of implementing the Agreement referred to in Article 1 and without modifying its bilateral nature between the Community and Switzerland, the Principality of Liechtenstein may cause its interests to be represented through a representative within the Swiss delegation to the Joint Committee.
This additional Agreement will be approved by Switzerland, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Community in accordance with their own procedures.
It shall enter into force at the same time as the Agreement referred to in Article 1 and shall continue to apply for so long as the Treaty of 29 March 1923 remains in force.
DESIRING to consolidate and to extend, upon the enlargement of the European Economic Community, the economic relations existing between the Community and Iceland and to ensure, with due regard for fair conditions of competition, the harmonious development of their commerce for the purpose of contributing to the work of constructing Europe,
RESOLVED to this end to eliminate progressively the obstacles to substantially all their trade, in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concerning the establishment of free trade areas,
DECLARING their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, and in particular of developments in the Community, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations where it would appear to be useful in the interests of their economies to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement,
HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of these objectives and considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from the obligations which are incumbent upon them under other international agreements,
The aim of this Agreement is: (a) to promote through the expansion of reciprocal trade the harmonious development of economic relations between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland and thus to foster in the Community and in Iceland the advance of economic activity, the improvement of living and employment conditions, and increased productivity and financial stability,
(c) to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade.
The Agreement shall apply to products originating in the Community or Iceland: (i) which fall within Chapters 25 to 99 of the Brussels Nomenclature, excluding the products listed in Annex I;

3. The basic duty to which the successive reductions provided for in this Article and in Protocol No 1 are to be applied shall, for each product, be the duty actually applied on 1 January 1972.

The reduced duties calculated in accordance with this Article and Protocol No 1 shall be applied rounded to the first decimal place.

When production is started in Iceland of a product of like kind to one of those listed in Annex II, the duty to which the latter product is subject must be reduced to the level which would have been reached if that duty had been reduced in accordance with the timetable contained in Article 4 (1) since the entry into force of the Agreement.
If in respect of third countries a customs duty lower than the duty of a fiscal nature is introduced, the tariff reductions shall be made on the basis of the former duty.
3. Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom may retain until 1 January 1976 a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty upon implementation of Article 38 of the "Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties" drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

To this end the Contracting Parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 30.

From 1 July 1977 products originating in Iceland may not enjoy more favourable treatment when imported into the Community than that applied by the Member States of the Community between themselves.
Protocol No 6 lays down the special provisions applicable to imports of certain fish products into the Community.
The Agreement shall not preclude the maintenance or establishment of customs unions, free trade areas or arrangements for frontier trade, except in so far as they alter the trade arrangements provided for in this Agreement, in particular the provisions concerning rules of origin.
The Contracting Parties shall refrain from any measure or practice of an internal fiscal nature establishing, whether directly or indirectly, discrimination between the products of one Contracting Party and like products originating in the territory of the other Contracting Party.
Products exported to the territory of one of the Contracting Parties may not benefit from repayment of internal taxation in excess of the amount of direct or indirect taxation imposed on them.
Payments relating to trade in goods and the transfer of such payments to the Member State of the Community in which the creditor is resident or to Iceland shall be free from any restrictions.

Such prohibitions or restrictions must not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between the Contracting Parties.
Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking any measures: (a) which it considers necessary to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests;
(b) which relate to trade in arms, munitions or war materials or to research, development or production indispensable for defence purposes, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes;

1. The TIR carnet may be discharged unconditionally or conditionally ; where discharge is conditional this shall be on account of facts connected with the TIR operation itself.
2. When the customs authorities of a country have discharged a TIR carnet unconditionally they can no longer claim from the guaranteeing association payment of the sums mentioned in Article 8 (1) and (2) unless the certificate of discharge was obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner.
1. Where a TIR carnet has not been discharged or has been discharged conditionally, the competent authorities shall not have the right to claim payment of the sums mentioned in Article 8 (1) and (2) from the guaranteeing association unless, within a period of one year from the date of acceptance of the TIR carnet by those authorities, they have notified the association in writing of the non-discharge or conditional discharge.
The same provision shall apply where the certificate of discharge was obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner, save that the period shall be two years.
2. The claim for payment of the sums referred to in Article 8 (1) and (2) shall be made to the guaranteeing association at the earliest three months after the date on which the association was informed that the carnet had not been discharged or had been discharged conditionally or that the certificate of discharge had been obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner and at the latest not more than two years after that date.
However, in cases which, during the abovementioned period of two years, become the subject of legal proceedings, any claim for payment shall be made within one year of the date on which the decision of the court becomes enforceable.
3. The guaranteeing association shall have a period of three months, from the date when a claim for payment is made upon it, in which to pay the amounts claimed.
The sums paid shall be reimbursed to the association if, within the two years following the date on which the claim for payment was made, it has been established to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that no irregularity was committed in connection with the transport operation in question.

Containers approved for the transport of goods under customs seal in accordance with the Customs Convention on containers, 1956, the agreements arising therefrom concluded under the auspices of the United Nations, the Customs Convention on containers, 1972, or any international instruments that may supersede or modify the latter Convention, shall be considered as complying with the provisions of paragraph 1 above and must be accepted for transport under the TIR procedure without further approval.
1. Each Contracting Party reserves the right to refuse to recognize the validity of the approval of road vehicles or containers which do not meet the conditions set forth in Articles 12 and 13 above.
Nevertheless, Contracting Parties shall avoid delaying traffic when the defects found are of minor importance and do not involve any risk of smuggling.
2. Before it is used again for the transport of goods under customs seal, any road vehicle or container which no longer meets the conditions which justified its approval, shall be either restored to its original state, or presented for re-approval.
1. No special customs document shall be required in respect of the temporary importation of a road vehicle, combination of vehicles or container carrying goods under cover of the TIR procedure.
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not prevent a Contracting Party from requiring the fulfilment at the customs office of destination of formalities laid down by its national regulations to ensure that, once the TIR operation has been completed, the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container will be re-exported.
When a road vehicle or combination of vehicles is carrying out a TIR operation, one rectangular plate bearing the inscription "TIR" and conforming to the specifications given in Annex 5 to this Convention shall be affixed to the front and another to the rear of the road vehicle or combination of vehicles.
These plates shall be so placed as to be clearly visible and shall be removable.
1. A single TIR carnet shall be made out in respect of each road vehicle or container.
However, a single TIR carnet may be made out in respect of a combination of vehicles or for several containers loaded on to a single road vehicle or on to a combination of vehicles.
In that case the TIR manifest of the goods covered by the TIR carnet shall list separately the content of each vehicle in the combination of vehicles or of each container.
It shall contain at least the number of detachable vouchers for customs acceptance and for discharge which are necessary for the transport operation in question.
A TIR operation may involve several customs offices of departure and destination, but, save as may otherwise be authorized by the Contracting Party or Parties concerned: (a) the customs offices of departure shall be situated in only one country;

The goods and the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container shall be produced with the TIR carnet at the customs office of departure.
The customs authorities of the country of departure shall take such measures as are necessary for satisfying themselves as to the accuracy of the goods manifest and/or for affixing the customs seals or for checking customs seals affixed under the responsibility of the said customs authorities by duly authorized persons.
For journeys in the territory of their country, the customs authorities may fix a time limit and require the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container to follow a prescribed route.
At each customs office en route and at customs offices of destination, the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container shall be produced for purposes of control to the customs authorities together with the load and the TIR carnet relating thereto.
1. As a general rule and except when they examine the goods in accordance with Article 5 (2), the customs authorities of the customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the customs seals of other Contracting Parties, provided that they are intact.
The said customs authorities may, however, if control requirements make it necessary, add their own seals.
2. The customs seals thus accepted by a Contracting Party shall have in the territory of that Contracting Party the benefit of the same legal protection as is accorded to the national seals.
The customs authorities shall not, except in special cases: - require road vehicles, combinations of vehicles or containers to be escorted at the carriers' expense on the territory of their country,
- require examination en route of road vehicles, combinations of vehicles or containers and their loads.
If the customs authorities conduct an examination of the load of a road vehicle, combination of vehicles or container in the course of the journey or at a customs office en route, they shall record on the TIR carnet vouchers used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils, and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet, particulars of the new seals affixed and of the controls carried out.
If the customs seals are broken en route otherwise than in the circumstances of Articles 24 and 35, or if any goods are destroyed or damaged without breaking of such seals, the procedure laid down in Annex 1 to this Convention for the use of the TIR carnet shall, without prejudice to the possible application of the provisions of national law, be followed, and the certified report in the TIR carnet shall be completed.
1. When transport under cover of a TIR carnet takes place in part in the territory of a State which is not a Contracting Party to this Convention, the TIR operation shall be suspended during that part of the journey.
In that case, the customs authorities of the Contracting Party on whose territory the journey continues shall accept the TIR carnet for the resumption of the TIR operation, provided that the customs seals and/or identifying marks have remained intact.
2. The same shall apply where for a part of the journey the TIR carnet is not used by the holder of the carnet in the territory of a Contracting Party because of the existence of simpler customs transit procedures or when the use of a customs transit regime is not necessary.
3. In such cases the customs offices where the TIR operation is suspended or resumed shall be deemed to be customs offices of exit en route and customs offices of entry en route respectively.
Subject to the provisions of this Convention, and in particular Article 18, another customs office of destination may he substituted for a customs office of destination originally indicated.
On arrival of the load at the customs office of destination, and provided that the goods are then placed under another system of customs control or are cleared for home use, discharge of the TIR carnet shall take place without delay.
1. The provisions of this section apply only to the transport of heavy or bulky goods as defined in Article 1 (k) of this Convention.
2. Where the provisions of this section apply, heavy or bulky goods may, if the authorities at the customs office of departure so decide, be carried by means of non-sealed vehicles or containers.
3. The provisions of this section shall apply only if, in the opinion of the authorities at the customs office of departure, the heavy or bulky goods carried and any accessories carried with them can be easily identified by reference to the description given, or can be provided with customs seals and/or identifying marks so as to prevent any substitution, or removal of the goods, without its being obvious.
All the provisions of this Convention, save those to which the special provisions of this section make an exception, shall apply to the transport of heavy or bulky goods under the TIR procedure.
The liability of the guaranteeing association shall cover not only the goods enumerated in the TIR carnet, but also any goods which, though not enumerated in the carnet, are on the load platform or among the goods enumerated in the TIR carnet.
The cover and all vouchers of the TIR carnet shall bear the endorsement "heavy or bulky goods" in hold letters in English or in French.
The authorities at the customs office of departure may require such packing lists, photographs, drawings, etc., as are necessary for the identification of the goods carried to be appended to the TIR carnet.
In this case they shall endorse these documents, one copy of the said documents shall be attached to the inside of the cover page of the TIR carnet, and all the manifests of the TIR carnet shall include a reference to such documents.
The authorities at the customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the customs seals and/or identifying marks affixed by the competent authorities of other Contracting Parties.
They may, however, affix additional seals and/or identifying marks ; they shall record particulars of the new seals and/or identifying marks on the vouchers of the TIR carnet used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet.
If customs authorities conducting an examination of the load at a customs office en route or in the course of the journey are obliged to break seals and/or remove identifying marks, they shall record the new seals and/or identifying marks on the vouchers of the TIR carnet, used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet.
Any breach of the provisions of this Convention shall render the offender liable, in the country where the offence was committed, to the penalties prescribed by the law of that country.
When it is not possible to establish in which territory an irregularity was committed it shall be deemed to have been committed in the territory of the Contracting Party where it is detected.
1. Each of the Contracting Parties shall have the right to exclude temporarily or permanently from the operation of this Convention any person guilty of a serious offence against the customs laws or regulations applicable to the international transport of goods.
2. This exclusion shall be notified immediately to the customs authorities of the Contracting Party on whose territory the person concerned is established or resident, and also to the guaranteeing association(s) in the country where the offence has been committed.
When TIR operations are accepted as being otherwise in order: 1. The Contracting Parties shall disregard minor discrepancies in the observance of time limits or routes prescribed.
The customs administrations of the countries of departure and of destination shall not consider the holder of the TIR carnet responsible for the discrepancies which may be discovered in those countries, when the discrepancies in fact relate to the customs procedures which preceded or followed a TIR operation and in which the holder was not involved.
When it is established to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that goods specified on the manifest of a TIR carnet have been destroyed or have been irrecoverably lost by accident or force majeure or that they are short by reason of their nature, payment of the duties and taxes normally due shall be waived.
On receipt from a Contracting Party of a request giving the relevant reasons, the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties concerned in a TIR operation shall furnish that Contracting Party with all available information needed for implementation of the provisions of Articles 39, 40 and 41 above.

WHEREAS: (a) The EEC has decided to contribute to the Special Action Programme decided at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual low-income countries facing general problems of transfer of resources hampering their development;
(c) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States, and the Association shall use its best efforts to assure, that the entire amount to be contributed by the Member States be committed within six months from the effective date of the Agreement and disbursed on credits as far as possible within two years from the effective date;
(d) The EEC and the Association have consulted regarding the proposed implementation and administration of this Agreement and the commitment of funds to assure a broad and balanced geographical distribution thereunder.
To that end the Association has furnished the EEC with a table showing the manner in which it would propose to apply the criteria set forth in this Agreement;
There is hereby established by the Association a special account entitled "Special Action Account" constituted by the monies which the Member States shall contribute to the Special Action Account in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement which shall be held in trust and used by the Association, acting as administrator (the Association acting in that capacity is hereinafter referred to as the administrator) only for the purpose of, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Agreement.
The Special Action Account shall be kept separate and apart from all other accounts and assets of the Association.
Payment of each contribution shall be made as follows: (a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest bearing notes of the Member State payable on demand in its currency and to the order of the Association, as administrator of the Special Action Account, and deposited in the depository of the Association in the country concerned.
(b) Payment shall be made in two instalments: (i) the first, consisting of at least 45 % of each contribution, shall be made within 30 days after the effective date of this Agreement, or such other date as may be agreed between the EEC and the administrator;
(ii) the second, consisting of the balance of the contribution, shall be made by 1 January 1979 or such other date as may be agreed between the EEC and the administrator taking account of the time necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budgets.
(c) Any Member State which so wishes may make its payments more rapidly than as indicated above.
The administrator shall draw on the cash or notes on an approximately pro rata basis in accordance with the Association's normal procedures in order to meet disbursements of Special Action Credits and to maintain a reasonable working balance in the Special Action Account.
In making such credits, the administrator shall, in accordance with the EEC's requirements, be guided by the following factors: (i) the relative poverty of the developing country concerned and its long-term growth potential;
(iii) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and prospective economic problems of the country;
(vi) the composition and the trend of the debt service obligations of the country and its capacity for any further borrowing upon non-concessional terms ; and
(vii) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are likely to be met by contributions from other sources.
Each Special Action Credit shall be made for the purpose of financing a clearly identifiable, quick-disbursing development programme or project (including a sector project) which, whether or not it is included in the Association's own lending programme, shall be appraised, approved and administered in accordance with the procedures and practices applicable to development credits made out of the Association's regular resources, taking account of the objective of additionality referred to in paragraph (b) of the preamble to this Agreement.
The resources of the Special Action Account shall not be used in substitution for regular resources of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("the Bank") or of the Association committed under a loan or credit for a programme or project which, at the effective date of this Agreement, shall have been approved by the executive directors of the Bank or the Association.
Except as provided in Section 4, the terms of repayment of each Special Action Credit shall be the same as those generally applicable to development credits made by the Association, that is to say, it shall be repayable over 50 years and with a 10-year grace period.
Special Action Credits shall be made in one or more currencies of the Member States and shall be repayable in those currencies.
Amounts paid for this charge shall be paid directly to and retained by the Association.
Each Special Action Credit shall be evidenced by a separate credit agreement between the borrowing country and the administrator, indicating in particular the origin of the resources.
The proceeds of each Special Action Credit may be used for expenditures in the currency of the borrowing country or for goods produced in, or services supplied from, (i) any of the Member States ; (ii) developing countries which are members of the Association and which could be recipients of a Special Action Credit, as determined by the administrator at the time of the agreement of the credit.
The principal repayments of Special Action Credits shall be made payable to the Special Action Account and the amount of the currency of a Member State so repaid shall as soon as practicable thereafter be returned by the administrator to such Member State.
Until all Special Action Credits shall have been committed, the administrator shall keep the EEC informed of projects and programmes being prepared for consideration by the executive directors and those which have been approved by the executive directors.
During the period of disbursement of Special Action Credits the administrator shall inform the EEC quarterly of the progress of the Special Action Credits and of the disbursements made thereunder.
The administrator shall, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year of the Association, furnish to the EEC a detailed statement of the Special Action Account, together with an opinion of the Association's own external auditors of such statement.
After the Special Action Credits shall have been fully disbursed, the administrator shall as soon as practicable furnish to the EEC a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed from the Special Action Account.
The administrator shall establish and maintain appropriate records and accounts to identify the contributions to the Special Action Account, the commitments to be financed out of the Account, and the receipts and disbursements of funds in the Account and repayments to the Member States.
The EEC and the administrator shall fully cooperate with each other to achieve the purposes of these arrangements.
To that end, until the Special Action Account is fully disbursed, the EEC (acting through the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator shall, from time to time, exchange views on the status and condition of the Special Action Account, on the progress of the programmes or projects financed out of the Special Action Credits, and on all other matters relating to these arrangements.
If this Agreement shall not have become effective by 31 December 1978, or such later date as may be agreed between the EEC and the Association, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
If and when the entire principal amount of all Special Action Credits withdrawn by borrowers thereunder shall have been repaid and returned to the Member States in accordance with Section 8 of Article II of this Agreement, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
This Agreement shall be approved by each Member State and the EEC in accordance with the procedural requirements of each party.
The Government of each Member State shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities when such procedural requirements applicable to it have been completed.
The General Secretariat shall forward such notification, together with a notification that the EEC has duly approved this Agreement, to the Association.
This Agreement shall become effective and enter into force on the first day of the month following receipt by the Association of such notifications.
This Agreement is drawn up in duplicate, in the Danish, Dutch, English, French, German and Italian languages, all these texts being equally authentic.

Moreover , in order to simplify the procedure to be followed in future for adjusting tariff specifications in the event of further amendments to the Customs Tariff of one or other of the Contracting Parties , an Article 12a should be inserted in the Agreement .
I have the honour to confirm the agreement of the Community to the amendments in question and I would propose that they enter into force with effect from 1 January 1978 .
I should be obliged if you would confirm the agreement of your Government to the foregoing .
I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of today's date worded as follows :
I should be obliged if you would confirm the agreement of your Government to the foregoing . "
AGREEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Settlements concerning the mobilization of claims held by the Member States under the medium-term financial assistance arrangements
The BIS could conclude stand-by credit agreements with the creditor countries' central banks if they should so request.
These agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid into the mechanism by the creditor country, with an overall limit of 2 725 million units of account, corresponding to half of the total of future commitment ceilings of the member countries.
However, certain conditions, which the BIS would be prepared to apply, can be indicated already:
The initial commitment of the BIS for each stand-by credit would be for two years with the option of renewal for other periods, the total not to exceed five years.
On the opening of credits, and whenever they are renewed, the BIS would take a Commission.
It would also be understood that, in order to allow it to carry out the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity, the first drawings would not take place until one month after the conclusion of the stand-by agreement.
Drawings would be in the currencies available to the BIS at the time the agreements were concluded, most probably in US dollars ; they would be for periods to be negotiated in the light of the Bank's resources, probably three or six months.
The conditions would be equivalent to those applied by the BIS at the time for transactions concluded on similar terms, i.e. at close to market rates.
However, if the BIS should itself have to have recourse to the market to procure the necessary funds, the rate applied could reach a maximum equivalent to Libor plus an appropriate margin.
I should be obliged if you would inform me whether the Council of the European Communities is in agreement with the above.
"The BIS could conclude stand-by credit agreements with the creditor countries' central banks if they should so request.
I should be obliged if you would inform me whether the Council of the European Communities is in agreement with the above."
I have the honour to inform you that the Council of the European Communities is in agreement with the contents of your letter.

The Parties to the Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade (hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement"),
Having regard to the multilateral trade negotiations and to the desire expressed by the Trade Negotiations Committee at its meeting of 11 and 12 April 1979 to arrive at a single text of an Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement of tariffs and trade;
Considering that the provisions of Article 27 of the Agreement relating to amendments have not yet entered into force;
Hereby: I 1. Agree to the deletion of the provision of Article 1 (2) (b) (iv) of the Agreement;
2. Recognize that the five-year delay in the application of the provisions of the Agreement by developing countries provided for in Article 21 (1) may, in practice, be insufficient for certain developing countries.
In such cases a developing country Party to the Agreement may request before the end of the period referred to in Article 21 (1) an extension of such period, it being understood that the Parties to the Agreement will give sympathetic consideration to such a request in cases where the developing country in question can show good cause;
3. Recognize that developing countries which currently value goods on the basis of officially established minimum values may wish to make a reservation to enable them to retain such values on a limited and transitional basis under such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the Parties to the Agreement;
4. Recognize that developing countries which consider that the reversal of the sequential order at the request of the importer provided for in Article 4 of the Agreement may give rise to real difficulties for them may wish to make a reservation to Article 4 in the following terms:
"The Government of ... reserves the right to provide that the relevant provision of Article 4 of the Agreement shall apply only when the customs authorities agree to the request to reverse the order of Articles 5 and 6."
If developing countries make such a reservation, the Parties to the Agreement shall consent to it under Article 23 of the Agreement;
5. Recognize that developing countries may wish to make a reservation with respect to Article 5 (2) of the Agreement in the following terms:
"The Government of ... reserves the right to provide that Article 5 (2) of the Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of the relevant note thereto whether or not the importer so requests."
If developing countries make such a reservation, the Parties to the Agreement shall consent to it under Article 23 of the Agreement;
6. Recognize that certain developing countries have expressed concern that there may be problems in the implementation of Article 1 of the Agreement in so far as it relates to importations into their countries by sole agents, sole distributors and sole concessionaires.
The Parties to the Agreement agree that, if such problems arise in practice in developing countries applying the Agreement, a study of this question shall be made, at the request of such countries, with a view to finding appropriate solutions;
7. Agree that Article 17 recognizes that in applying the Agreement, customs administrations may need to make enquiries concerning the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented to them for customs valuation purposes.
They further agree that the Article thus acknowledges that enquiries may be made which are, for example, aimed at verifying that the elements of value declared or presented to customs in connection with a determination of customs value are complete and correct.
They recognize that Parties to the Agreement, subject to their national laws and procedures, have the right to expect the full cooperation of importers in these enquiries;
8. Agree that the price actually paid or payable includes all payments actually made or to be made as a condition of sale of the imported goods, by the buyer to the seller, or by the buyer to a third party to satisfy an obligation of the seller.
It is open for acceptance, by signature or otherwise, by signatories of the Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade and by other governments accepting or acceding to the Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Article 22 thereof.
ARRANGEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argentine Republic on trade in mutton and lamb
I have the honour to refer to the negotiations recently undertaken between our respective delegations for the purpose of drawing up provisions concerning import into the European Economic Community of mutton, lamb and goatmeat from Argentina, on connection with implementation by the Community of the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat.
This arrangement shall relate to: - fresh or chilled mutton, lamb and goatmeat (02.01 A IV a)),
Within the terms of this arrangement, the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Argentina to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity : 20 000 tonnes expressed in carcass weight (1).
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement, Argentina undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation (frozen or chilled).
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade, the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution.
Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause, it undertakes that Argentina's access into the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected.
If imports in any one year exceed the quantities agreed, the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Argentina for the remainder of that year.
By this term is understood the weight of bone-in meat presented as such as well as boned meat converted by a coefficient into bone-in weight. For this purpose 55 kg of boned mutton corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in mutton and 60 kg of boned lamb corresponds to 100 kg of bone-in lamb.
At the time of accession of new Member States, the Community, in consultation with Argentina, will alter the quantities set out in paragraph 2, in accordance with Argentina's trade with each new Member State.
The charges applicable to imports for the said new Member States shall be fixed in accordance with rules in the Treaty of Accession ; the maximum level of the levy specified in point 5 of this arrangement being taken into account.
The total quantity as mentioned in clause 2 above is fixed at 23 000 tonnes in carcass weight as from the date of accession of Greece to the Community.
The Community will endeavour to avoid any market development which could prejudice the marketing of Argentina's mutton and lamb on the Community market within the limits of the quantities agreed.
In particular, the Community will take steps to ensure that the disposal of intervention stocks in frozen form arising from the operation of the regulation does not undermine such marketing of Argentina's mutton and lamb.
In taking account of the objectives and provisions of this arrangement the Community agrees that any actual implementation of refunds or any other form of assistance with respect to exports of mutton, lamb and live sheep and lamb intended for slaughter will apply only at prices and on conditions which comply with existing international obligations and in respect of the traditional shares of the Community of world export trade in these products.
These words shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of GATT and in particular in conformity with Article 10 (2) (c) of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade.
Argentina shall ensure that this arrangement is observed, in particular, by issuing export certificates covering the products referred to in paragraph 1 within the limits of the quantities covered by this arrangement.
For its part, the Community shall undertake to adopt all necessary provisions to make the issue of the import certificates for the products referred to above, originating in Argentina, subject to the presentation of an export certificate, issued by the competent authority designated by the Argentine Government.
Detailed rules for applying this system shall be laid down in such a way as to render unnecessary the lodging of a security for the issue of the import certificate in respect of the products in question.
Also, such detailed rules of application shall provide that the competent Argentine authority shall communicate periodically to the competent authority of the Community the quantities in respect of which export certificates are issued, broken down, where appropriate, according to destination.
The Committee shall ensure that the arrangement is being properly applied and is functioning smoothly.
It will examine regularly the trend of the two parties' markets in mutton and lamb and goatmeat and the trend of the international market, as well as marketing conditions on those markets including those relevant to the objective set out in clause 7 of this arrangement.
It will ensure that the proper application of the arrangement is not affected by the export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat-based products to the Community under customs headings not referred to by the arrangement.
The Committee will discuss all questions which could arise in applying the arrangement and will recommend appropriate solutions to the competent authorities.
The provisions of this arrangement shall be agreed without prejudice to the parties' rights and obligations under GATT.
The annual quantity fixed in clause 2 refers to the period running from 1 January to 31 December.
The quantity applicable as of the implementation of the present arrangement and until 1 January of the following year will be fixed on a pro rata basis in relation to the total annual quantity and will take into account the seasonality of the trade.
This arrangement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territory of the Argentine Republic.
It shall remain in force until 31 March 1984, and shall continue in force thereafter subject to each party having the right to denounce it by giving one year's notice in writing.
In any case the provisions of this arrangement will be examined by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with a view to making any adjustment which they agree is necessary.
I should be obliged if you would kindly confirm the agreement of your Government to the foregoing.
I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of today's date, which reads as follows:

PROTOCOL to the 1979 Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution on long-term financing of the cooperative programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (EMEP)
Recalling that the Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution (hereinafter referred to as 'the Convention') entered into force on 16 March 1983,
Aware of the importance of the cooperative programme for the monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (hereinafter referred to as EMEP), as provided for in Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention,
Recognizing that the implementation of EMEP has hitherto been made possible by financial means provided by the United Nations environment programme (UNEP) and by voluntary contributions from governments,
Bearing in mind that since the UNEP contribution will continue only until the end of 1984, and that since this contribution together with the voluntary contributions from governments have been inadequate to support fully the EMEP work plan, it will therefore be necessary to provide for long-term funding after 1984,
Considering the appeal of the Economic Commission for Europe to ECE member governments, contained in its decision B (XXXVIII), to make available, on a basis to be agreed at the first meeting of the Executive Body for the Convention (hereinafter referred to as the 'Executive Body'), the financial resources to enable the Executive Body to carry out its activities, in particular as regards the work of EMEP,
N°ting that the Convention does not contain any provisions for financing EMEP and that it is, therefore, necessary to make appropriate arrangements regarding this matter,

4.'Geographical scope of EMEP' means the area within which, coordinated by the international centres of EMEP(1), monitoring is carried out.
Financing of EMEP The financing of EMEP shall cover the annual costs of the international centres cooperating within EMEP for the activities appearing in the work programe of the Steering Body of EMEP.
1. In accordance with the provisions of this Article the financing of EMEP shall consist of mandatory contributions, supplemented by voluntary contributions.
2. Mandatory contributions shall be made on an annual basis by all Contracting Parties to the present Protocol which are within the geographical scope of EMEP.
3. Voluntary contributions may be made by the Contracting Parties or Signatories to the present Protocol, even if their territory lies outside the geographical scope of EMEP, as well as, subject to approval by the Executive Body, on the recommendation of the Steering Body of EMEP, by any other country, organization or individual which wishes to contribute to the work programme.
Contributions in cash and in kind, such as those provided by host countries for international centres, shall be specified in the work programme.
Voluntary contributions may, subject to the approval by the executive Body, on the recommendation of the Steering Body, be utilized either for reducing the mandatory contributions or for financing specific activities within the scope of EMEP.
5. Mandatory and voluntary contributions in cash shall be deposited in the General Trust Fund.
(a)if the annual budget of EMEP increases by a factor of two and a half times the level of the annual budget adopted for the year of entry into force of the present Protocol or for the year of last amendment of the Annex, whichever is later; or
(c)six years after the entry into force of the present Protocol, or six years after the last amendment to the Annex, whichever is later.

2. The text of proposed amendments shall be submitted in writing to the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe, who shall communicate them to all Contracting Parties to the Protocol.
The Executive Body shall discuss the proposed amendments at its next annual meeting provided that such proposals have been circulated by the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe to the Contracting Parties to the Protocol at least 90 days in advance.
3. An amendment to the present Protocol, other than an amendment to its Annex, shall be adopted by consensus of the representatives of the Contracting Parties to the Protocol, and shall enter into force for the Contracting Parties to the Protocol which have accepted it on the 90th day after the date on which two-thirds of those Contracting Parties have deposited with the depositary their instruments of acceptance of the amendment.
The amendment shall enter into force for any other Contracting Party on the 90th day after the date on which that Contracting Party deposits its instrument of acceptance of the amendment.
Settlement of disputes If a dispute arises between two or more Contracting Parties to the present Protocol as to its interpretation or application, they shall seek a solution by negotiation or by any other method of dispute settlement acceptable to the parties to the dispute.

Contracting Parties to the European Agreement of 15 December 1958 on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin (hereinafter called "the Agreement"),
Having regard to the provisions of Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Agreement, according to which "The Contracting Parties shall take all necessary measures to exempt from all import duties the therapeutic substances of human origin placed at their disposal by the other Parties';
Considering that so far as the Member States of the European Economic Community are concerned, the undertaking to grant this exemption falls within the competence of the Community, which possesses the necessary powers in this respect by virtue of the treaty which instituted it;
Considering therefore that for the purpose of the implementation of Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Agreement, it is necessary for the European Economic Community to be able to become a Contracting Party to the Agreement,
In respect of the Community, the Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the month following such signature.
It shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the last of the Contracting Parties has deposited its instrument of acceptance with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
2. However, this Additional Protocol shall enter into force on the expiration of a period of two years from the date on which it has been opened for acceptance, unless one of the Contracting Parties has notified an objection to the entry into force.
From that date, no State may become a Contracting Party to the Agreement without at the same time becoming a Contracting Party to the Additional Protocol.
The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe shall notify the member States of the Council of Europe, any State having acceded to the Agreement and the European Economic Community of any acceptance or objection made under Article 2 and of the date of entry into force of this Additional Protocol in accordance with Article 2.
The Secretary-General shall also notify the European Economic Community of any act, notification or communication relating to the Agreement.
Considering that it is most desirable that member countries, in a spirit of European solidarity, should assist one another in the supply of these blood-grouping reagents, should the need arise;
Considering that such mutual assistance is only possible if the character and use of such blood-grouping reagents are subject to rules laid down jointly by the member countries and if the necessary import facilities and exemptions are granted,
For the purposes of this Agreement, the expression "blood-grouping reagents" refers to reagents of human, animal and plant and other origin, used for blood-grouping and for the detection of blood incompatibilities.
Any Contracting Party may, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, when signing this Agreement or depositing its instrument of ratification or approval, or accession, limit the application of this Agreement to blood-grouping reagents of human origin.
This declaration may be withdrawn at any time, by notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
The Contracting Parties undertake, provided that they have sufficient stocks for their own needs, to make blood-grouping reagents available to other Parties who are in urgent need of them and to charge only those costs of collection, processing and carriage of such substances and the cost (if any) of their purchase.
Blood-grouping reagents shall be made available to the other Contracting Parties subject to the condition that no profit is made on them, that they shall be used solely for medical purposes and shall be delivered only to bodies designated by the Government concerned.
All consignments of blood-grouping reagents shall be accompanied by a certificate to the effect that they were prepared in accordance with the specifications in the Protocol.
The Protocol and its Annex constitute an administrative arrangement and may be amended or supplemented by the Governments of the Parties to this Agreement.
The Contracting Parties shall take all necessary measures to exempt from all import duties the blood-grouping reagents placed at their disposal by the other Parties.
They shall also take all necessary measures to provide for the speedy delivery of these substances, by the most direct route, to the consignees referred to in Article 3 of this Agreement.
The Contracting Parties shall forward to one another, through the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, a list of the bodies empowered to issue certificates as provided in Article 4 of this Agreement.
Wherever possible these bodies should be the same as those referred to in Article 6 of the European Agreement on the Exchange of Therapeutic Substances of Human Origin.
The present Agreement shall be open to the signature of Members of the Council of Europe, who may become Parties to it either by: (a) signature without reservation in respect of ratification or approval ; or
The present Agreement shall enter into force one month after the date on which three Members of the Council shall, in accordance with Article 7, have signed the Agreement without reservation in respect of ratification or approval or shall have ratified or approved it.
In the case of any Member of the Council who shall subsequently sign the Agreement without reservation in respect of ratification or approval or who shall ratify or approve it, the Agreement shall enter into force one month after the date of such signature or the date of deposit of the instrument of ratification or approval.
After the entry into force of this Agreement, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non-member State to accede to the present Agreement.
The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe shall notify Members of the Council and acceding States: (a) of the date of entry into force of this Agreement and of the names of any Members who have signed without reservation in respect of ratification or approval or who have ratified or approved it;
Any Contracting Party may terminate its own application of the Agreement by giving one year's notice to that effect to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
A blood-grouping (1) reagent must react with all blood samples tested which contain the antigen homologous to the antibody or other substance mentioned on the label.
When a reagent is used according to the technique recommended by the producer there must be no evidence of any of the following factors or phenomena: (a) haemolytic properties;
Titre is measured by making successive two-fold dilutions of the reagent under study in an appropriate medium.
The titre is the reciprocal of the figure representing the highest serum dilution in which a reaction occurs, the dilution being calculated without the inclusion of the volume of the corpuscular suspension in the total volume.
In the case of anti-A, anti-B and other reagents intended for use on slides, avidity is expressed by means of the time required for agglutination on a slide.
International Standards have been established by the World Health Organization for anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D blood-grouping reagents and are in process of being established for blood-grouping reagents of other specificities.
An International Standard Preparation contains, by definition, a certain number of International Units per mg or ml and this definition is independent of the titres observed against particular red corpuscle preparations (2).
(1)At the time of approving the present version of the Protocol and its Annexes, it was understood by the representatives of the Contracting Parties that when in the English text of the Agreement the expression "blood incompatibilities" was mentioned, "blood grouping incompatibilities" was implied.
It was also agreed that the expression "blood-grouping" with a hyphen in the English text on the Agreement and of the Protocol should read as "blood grouping" without a hyphen.
The potency of blood-grouping reagents for which International Standard Preparations exist (at present anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D) can be expressed in International Units (see Bull, Wld. Hlth. Org. 1954, 10, 937, 941-1950, 3, 301) on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison with the International Standard, or a national sub-standard.
When reconstituted to the volume of 1 ml, the anti-A and anti-B sera contain by definition 256 International Units per ml.
They can be obtained free of charge, from the International Laboratory for Biological Standards of WHO, Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen.
The following table shows an example of a comparative titration of the International Standard anti-A Serum (S) and an "unknown" anti-A reagent (U) against A1 red corpuscles and A2B red corpuscles. >PIC FILE= "T0045086">
Each reagent, when kept under the conditions of storage recommended by the manufacturer, should retain the requisite properties for at least one year.
The expiry date of a reagent in the liquid form as given on the label shall be not more than one year from the date of the last satisfactory potency test.
The expiry date of reagents in the dried form as given on the label shall be in accordance with evidence obtained from experiments on stability and shall be approved by the national control authorities.
Dried reagents shall be kept in an atmosphere of an inert gas or in vacuo, in the glass container in which they were dried and which shall be closed so as to exclude moisture.
A dried reagent must not lose more than 0,5 % of its weight when tested by further drying over phosphorus pentoxide at a pressure not exceeding 0,02 mm of mercury for 24 hours.
In order to prevent bacterial growth the competent national authority may decide that an antiseptic and/or antibiotic shall be added to the reagent (or to any solvent issued with dried reagents), provided that, in the presence of the added substance, the reagent still fulfils the requirements for specificity and potency.
Blood-grouping sera of human origin must contain at least 2,5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or reconstituted serum.
Reagents whether in the liquid state or after reconstitution should be transparent and should not contain any sediment, gel or visible particles.
Blood-grouping reagents for international exchanges should preferably not be artificially coloured at least until an international agreement is reached on a uniform system.
Blood-grouping reagents shall be dispensed in such a way and in such volumes that the reagent in one container is sufficient for the performance of tests with positive and negative control corpuscles in addition to the performance of tests with the unknown corpuscles.
The volume in one container shall be such that the contents can if necessary be used for the performance of the appropriate tests for potency described in this Protocol.
Written records shall be kept by the producing laboratory of all steps in the production and control of blood-grouping reagents.
Adequate samples of all reagents issued shall be retained by the laboratory until it can be reasonably assumed that the batch is no longer in use.
Reagents used for blood-grouping may contain substances of human, animal, vegetable (or mineral) origin, of which some constitute the active principle and others are adjuvants for enhancing the activity or maintaining the stability of the reagent.
For technical reasons these reagents have been divided into three categories according to the origin of their active principle.
This does not mean that reagents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reagents cannot contain substances of human origin.
A label printed in English and French, in black on white paper, shall be affixed to each final container and shall contain the following information: 1. Name and address of producer;
4. The volume or, where the reagent is dried, the volume and composition of the fluid needed for reconstitution;
Moreover, this label or the label of the carton enclosing several final containers, or the leaflet accompanying the containers, shall contain the following information: 1. Full name and address of producer;
3. The volume, or, where the reagent is dried, the volume and composition of the fluid needed for reconstitution;
Each consignment shall be accompanied by a certificate as provided in Article 4 of the Agreement and the Annex to the present Protocol.
Anti-A serum is derived from the blood of selected group B persons, who may or may not have been immunized by group A red corpuscles or group A specific substance.
Anti-A serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.
An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, A2, and A2B corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation.
The potency of the serum shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
When anti-A serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A1, A2 and A2B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination of each suspension should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
Anti-B serum is derived from the blood of selected group A persons, who may or may not have been immunized by group B red corpuscles or group B specific substance.
Anti-B serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups B and AB, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen, i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A.
An anti-B serum shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation.
When anti-B serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or with reference standard of equivalent avidity.
Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is derived from the blood of selected group 0 persons who may or may not have been immunized by group A and group B red corpuscles or group A and group B specific substances.
Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A or B agglutinogens or both, i.e. those of group A including subgroups A1 and A2, group B and group AB including subgroups A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A or B agglutinogens, i.e. those of group 0.
It agglutinates human red corpuscles containing the Ax (Ay or Ao) antigen (which are not, in general, agglutinated by anti-A serum derived from group B donors).
An anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, and A2 corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation.
It shall also be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation.
The potency of the serum shall in every case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) blood-grouping serum used undiluted shall also give readily detectable agglutination of group Ax (Ay or Ao) corpuscles.
When anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is mixed on a slide with equal volumes of suspensions of A1 and A2 cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same tests are performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity.
When anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or a reference preparation of equivalent avidity.
When anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ax (Ay or Ao) cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1, agglutination shall first appear in not more than five minutes at a temperature between 18 and 25 °C.
Anti-Rh blood-grouping sera, whatever their specificity, may be of either of two varieties differing in the conditions under which agglutination of homologous corpuscles is obtained.
With others, commonly known as "incomplete", agglutination can only be obtained in the presence of certain colloids such as bovine albumin or by means of other special techniques.
Some "incomplete" sera will also agglutinate homologous red corpuscles suspended in their own serum or plasma on slides.
The following requirements of potency for Rh grouping sera may need to be revised when International Standard Preparations become available. (i) Anti-D (anti-Rho) blood-grouping serum (human)
Anti-D serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the D antigen of the Rh system.
It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the D antigen, but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the D antigen.
"Complete" anti-D sera shall have a titre of not less than 32 against CcDee cells in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre.
An "incomplete" anti-D serum shall be titrated against CcDee corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of Incomplete Anti-D (anti-Rho) or an equivalent reference preparation.
Besides reacting with all red corpuscles containing the D antigen, the serum should, as far as possible, react with corpuscles containing the Du antigen.
Anti-D sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson should, when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a 40 to 50 % suspension of CcDee corpuscles at approximately 40 °C, show visible agglutination within 30 seconds, and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds.
Anti-C serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the C agglutinogen of the Rh system.
It agglutinates suspensions of human red corpuscles containing the C antigen, but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the C antigen.
These sera are therefore specific for the C antigen only when the cells under test are suspended in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre.

AND THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA, THE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND, THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND, THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY, THE KINGDOM OF SWEDEN AND THE SWISS CONFEDERATION
CONSIDERING the Joint Declaration calling for the creation of a European economic space, adopted by Ministers of the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984, especially with regard to simplification of border formalities and rules of origin;
CONSIDERING that, in the framework of action to strengthen the internal market, the Community has decided to introduce a single administrative document for use in such trade from 1 January 1988;
CONSIDERING it appropriate to simplify also formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries as well as between the EFTA countries themselves, in particular by introducing a single administrative document;
CONSIDERING that no provision of this Convention may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from their obligations under other international agreements,
This Convention lays down measures to simplify formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries, as well as between the EFTA countries themselves, in particular by introducing a single administrative document (hereinafter referred to as the single document) to be used for any procedure at export and import and for a common transit procedure applicable to trade between the Contracting Parties (hereinafter referred to as transit), regardless of the kind and origin of the goods.
Where goods are the subject of trade between the Contracting Parties, the formalities connected with such trade shall be completed using a single document based on a declaration form, the specimens of which are to be found in Annex I to this Convention.
The single document shall, depending on the circumstances, serve as a declaration or document of export, transit or import.
- expressly required for the implementation of a legislation in force in a Contracting Party for which the use of the single document would not suffice;
- required from operators to enable them to qualify, at their request, for an advantage or a specific facility.
1. Nothing in this Convention shall preclude the Contracting Parties from applying simplified procedures, whether or not based on the use of computers, with a view to greater simplification for operators.
2. Simplified procedures may, in particular, consist in allowing operators not to have to present to a customs office either the goods in question or the declaration relating to them, or in allowing them to draw up an incomplete declaration.
In such cases, a declaration, which, if the competent authorities agree, may be a general periodic declaration, must be submitted subsequently within the time-limits laid down by those authorities.
In the cases referred to in paragraph 1, operators may be authorized to use commercial documents in the place of the single document.
Where the single document is used, the persons concerned may, on authorization by the competent authorities, attach to it commercial schedules describing the goods in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document for the purpose of completing formalities for any procedure at export and import.
- concluding between themselves agreements or arrangements with a view to greater simplification of formalities in all or part of the trade between them;
- allowing the use of loading lists for the completion of transit formalities in the case of consignments composed of several kinds of goods, in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document;
- allowing declarations to be made, where appropriate on plain paper, by means of public or private computers on conditions fixed by the competent authorities;
- enabling the competent authorities to require that data necessary for completing the formalities in question be entered in their computerized declaration-processing systems without, where appropriate, requiring a written declaration;
- enabling the competent authorities, should a computerized declaration-processing system be used, to provide that the export, transit or import declaration be constituted either by the single document produced by that system or by entry of the data in the computer if such a document is not produced;
- applying any facility adopted by way of a decision of the Joint Committee, as referred to in Article 11 (3).
1. Provisions on the completion, by means of the single document, of the formalities needed for the export, transit and import of the goods are laid down in Annex II to this Convention.
2. The common codes to be used in the forms laid down in Annex I are to be found in Annex III to this Convention.
1. The declaration must be completed in one of the official languages of the Contracting Parties which is acceptable to the competent authorities of the country in which the export or transit formalities are completed.
Where necessary, the customs authority of the country of destination or of transit may require from the declarant or his representative in that country a translation of the said declaration into the official language or one of the official languages of that country.
2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the declaration shall be completed in one of the official languages of the country of import in all cases where the declaration in that country is made on copies of the declaration from other than those presented to the customs authorities of the country of export or departure.
1. The declarant or his representative may, for each stage of an operation involving trade in goods between Contracting Parties, use the copies of the declaration necessary for completion of the formalities relating to that stage alone, to which may be attached, where appropriate, the copies necessary for completion of the formalities relating to one or other of the subsequent stages of that operation.
2. The benefit of the provisions of paragraph 1 shall not be subject to compliance with any special condition imposed by the competent authorities.
However, without prejudice to specific provisions concerning groupage traffic, the competent authorities may lay down that formalities relating to export and transit operations should be completed on the same form by means of copies corresponding to these formalities.
In the cases referred to in Article 7, the competent authorities shall, to the extent possible, satisfy themselves that the particulars given in the copies of the declaration drawn up in the course of the various stages of the operation in question all agree.
1. In order to ensure the smooth functioning of trade between the Contracting Parties and to facilitate the detection of any irregularity or infringement, the customs authorities of the countries concerned shall, upon request or, where they consider that this would be in the interest of another Contracting Party, on their own initiative, provide
2. Assistance may be withheld or denied, totally or partly, when the requested country considers that the assistance would be prejudicial to its security, public policy (ordre public) or other essential interests, or would violate an industrial, commercial or professional secret.
3. If assistance is withheld or denied, the decision and the reasons therefor must be notified to the requesting country without delay.
4. If the customs authority of a country requests assistance which it would not be able to give if requested, it shall draw attention to that fact in the request.
5. Information obtained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be used solely for the purposes of this Convention and shall be accorded the same protection by a receiving country as is afforded to information of like nature under the national law of that country.
Such information may be used for other purposes only with the written consent of the customs authority which furnished them and subject to any restrictions laid down by that authority.
1. A Joint Committee is hereby established in which each Contracting Party to this Convention shall be represented.
4. The Joint Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure which shall contain, inter alia, provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the Chairman and his term of office.
5. The Joint Committee may decide to set up any Sub-Committee or Working Party that can assist it in carrying out its duties.
1. It shall be the responsibility of the Joint Committee to administer this Convention and ensure its proper implementation.
For this purpose, the said Committee shall be kept regularly informed, by the Contracting Parties, of the experiences gained from application of the Convention, shall make recommendations, and, in the cases provided for in paragraph 3, shall take decisions.
3. The Joint Committee shall adopt, by decision, amendments to the Annexes to this Convention and facilities referred to in the last indent of Article 4 (3).
4. If a Contracting Party's representative in the Joint Committee has accepted a decision subject to the fulfilment of constitutional requirements, the decision shall enter into force, if no date is contained therein, on the first day of the second month following notification that the reservation has been lifted.
Each Contracting Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the provisions of this Convention are effectively and harmoniously applied taking into account the need to reduce as far as possible the formalities imposed on trade and the need to achieve mutually satisfactory solutions of any difficulties arising out of the operation of those provisions.
1. This Convention shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territories of the EFTA countries.
2. This Convention shall also apply to the Principality of Lichtenstein for as long as that Principality remains bound to the Swiss Confederation by a customs union treaty.
Any Contracting Party may withdraw from this Convention provided it gives twelve months' notice in writing to the depositary referred to in Article 17 which shall notify all other Contracting Parties.
1. This Convention shall enter into force on 1 January 1988, provided that, before 1 November 1987, the Contracting Parties have deposited their instruments of acceptance with the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities, which shall act as depositary.
2. If this Convention does not enter into force on 1 January 1988, it shall do so on the first day of the second month following the deposit of the last instrument of acceptance.
This Convention, drawn up in a single original of the Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish languages, all texts being equally authentic, shall be deposited in the archives of the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities, which shall transmit a certified copy thereof to each Contracting Party.
I should like to propose the following arrangements which will serve as a basis for cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council the Exploration of the Sea.
1. The European Economic Community, represented by its Commission, hereinafter called 'the Commission', shall have the right to ask the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, hereinafter called 'the Council', for scientific advice on fisheries resources management and related matters, which the Council shall to the extent possible provide.
2. Having regard to the fishery management responsibilities of the Commission, the Council agrees to provide the Commission with all relevant reports of its Working Groups on stock assessment and of its Advisory Committee on Fishery Management.
3. The Council and the Commission shall consult regularly on ways in which cooperation between them can be further improved and extended and, in particular, shall explore means by which the Commission may establish a closer liaison with the Council's Advisory Committee on Fishery Management.
4. The Community will make a payment of Dkr 376 000 on the signature of this agreement and annual payments subsequently.
The annual payment shall exclude the costs of any meetings specifically requested by the Commission.
5. The terms of this agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties three years after it has gone into effect.
If they fail to agree new terms, the agreement shall continue on the basis of the existing terms until new terms have been agreed.

(iv) improve the situation of the olive-products industry as regards the environment, in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to abate any harmful effects;
(a) To facilitate the study and application of measures designed to expand international trade in olive products in order to increase the resources that producer countries, and especially developing producer countries, derive from their exports and to enable their economic growth and social development to be hastened, while taking consumer interests into account;
(b) To adopt whatever measures are appropriate to develop the consumption of olive oil and table olives;
(c) To forestall and, where appropriate, combat any practices of unfair competition in international trade in olive oil, olive-pomace oils and table olives

THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA, THE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND, THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND, THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY, THE KINGDOM OF SWEDEN, THE SWISS CONFEDERATION,
CONSIDERING the Joint Declaration calling for the creation of a European economic space, adopted by Ministers of the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984, especially with regard to simplification of border formalities and rules of origin,
CONSIDERING the Convention on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods, concluded between the EFTA countries and the Community, introducing a single administrative document for use in such trade,
CONSIDERING that the use of this single document within the framework of a common transit procedure for the carriage of goods between the Community and the EFTA countries and between the EFTA countries themselves would lead to simplification,
CONSIDERING that the most appropriate way of achieving this aim would be to extend to those EFTA countries which do not apply it the transit procedure which currently applies to the carriage of goods within the Community, between the Community and Austria and Switzerland, and between Austria and Switzerland,
1. This Convention lays down measures for the carriage of goods in transit between the Community and the EFTA countries as well as between the EFTA countries themselves, including, where applicable, goods transhipped, reconsigned or warehoused, by introducing a common transit procedure regardless of the kind and origin of the goods.
2. Without prejudice to the provisions of this Convention and in particular those concerning guarantees, goods circulating within the Community are deemed to be placed under the Community transit procedure.
3. Subject to the provisions of Articles 7 to 12 below, the rules governing the common transit procedure are set out in Appendices I and II to this Convention.
4. Transit declarations and transit documents for the purposes of the common transit procedure shall conform to and be made out in accordance with Appendix III.
1. The common transit procedure shall hereinafter be described as the T 1 procedure or the T 2 procedure, as the case may be.
2. The T 1 procedure may be applied to any goods carried in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 1.
3. The T 2 procedure shall apply to goods carried in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 1:
(b) in an EFTA country, only when the goods have arrived in that EFTA country under the T 2 procedure and are reconsigned under the special conditions laid down in Article 9 below.
4. The special conditions laid down in this Convention in respect of placing goods under the T 2 procedure shall apply also to the issue of T 2 L documents certifying the Community status of goods and goods covered by a T 2 L document shall be treated in the same way as goods carried under the T 2 procedure, except that the T 2 L document need not accompany the goods.
(a) 'transit' shall mean a customs procedure under which goods are carried, under customs control, from a customs office in one country to a customs office in the same or another country over at least one frontier;
2. In the application of the rules laid down in this Convention for the T 1 or T 2 procedure, the EFTA countries, and the Community and its Member States, shall have the same rights and obligations.
1. This Convention shall be without prejudice to the application of any other international agreement concerning a transit procedure, in particular the TIR procedure or the Rhine manifest, subject to any limitations to such application in respect of the carriage of goods from one point in the Community to another point in the Community and to any limitations to the issue of T 2 L documents certifying the Community status of goods.
(a) movements of goods under a temporary admission procedure; and (b) agreements concerning frontier traffic.
In the absence of an agreement between the Contracting Parties and a third country whereby goods moving between the Contracting Parties may be carried across that third country under the T 1 or T 2 procedure, such a procedure shall apply to goods carried across that third country only if
the carriage across that country is effected under cover of a single transport document drawn up in the territory of a Contracting Party and the operation of that procedure is suspended in the territory of the third country.
Provided that the implementation of any measures applicable to the goods is ensured, countries may, within the T 1 or T 2 procedure, introduce simplified procedures for certain types of traffic by means of bilateral or multilateral agreements.
Such agreements shall be notified to the Commission of the European Communities which shall inform the other countries.
1. Subject to any special provisions of this Convention, the competent customs offices of the EFTA countries are empowered to assume the functions of offices of departure, offices of transit, offices of destination and offices of guarantee.
2. The competent customs offices of the Member States of the Community shall be empowered to issue T 1 or T 2 documents for transit to an office of destination situated in an EFTA country.
Subject to any special provisions of this Convention, they shall also be empowered to issue T 2 L documents for goods consigned to an EFTA country.
4. Notwithstanding the requirement for the Community status of goods to be certified where applicable, a person completing export formalities at the frontier customs office of a Contracting Party shall not be required to place the goods consigned under the T 1 or the T 2 procedure, irrespective of the customs procedure under which the goods will be placed at the neighbouring frontier customs office.
5. Notwithstanding the requirement for the Community status of goods to be certified where applicable, the frontier customs office of the Contracting Party where export
formalities are completed may refuse to place the goods under the T 1 or T 2 procedure if that procedure is to end at the neighbouring frontier customs office.
N° addition, removal or substitution may be made in the case of goods forwarded under cover of a T 1 or T 2 document, in particular when consignments are split up, transhipped or bulked.
1. Goods which are brought into an EFTA country under the T 2 procedure and may be reconsigned under that procedure shall remain at all times under the control of the customs authorities of that country to ensure that there is no change in their identity or state.
2. Where such goods are reconsigned from an EFTA country after having been placed, in that EFTA country, under a customs procedure other than a transit or a warehousing procedure, no T 2 procedure may be applied.
This provision shall, however, not apply to goods which are admitted temporarily to be shown at an exhibition, fair or similar public display and which have received no treatment other than that needed for their preservation in their original state or for splitting up consignments.
3. Where goods are reconsigned from an EFTA country after storage under a warehousing procedure, the T 2 procedure may be applied only on the following conditions:
- that the goods have not been warehoused over a period exceeding five years; however, as regards goods falling within Chapters 1 to 24 of the Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs (International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System of 14 June 1983), that period shall be limited to six months,
- that the goods have been stored in special spaces and have received no treatment other than that needed for their preservation in their original state, or for splitting up consignments without replacing the packaging.
4. Any T 2 ot T 2 L document issued by a customs office of an EFTA country shall bear a reference to the corresponding T 2 or T 2 L document under which the goods arrived in that EFTA country and shall include all special endorsements appearing thereon.
1. Except where otherwise provided for in paragraph 2 below or in the Appendices, any T 1 or T 2 operation shall be covered by a guarantee valid for all countries involved in that operation.
(a) of Contracting Parties to agree among themselves that the guarantee shall be waived for T 1 or T 2 operations involving only their territories;
(b) of a Contracting Party not to require a guarantee for the part of a T 1 or T 2 operation between the office of departure and the first office of transit.
3. For the purposes of the flat-rate guarantee as provided for in Appendices I and II to this Convention, the ECU means the total of the following amounts:
The value of the ECU in a given currency shall be equal to the sum of the exchange values in that currency of the amounts set out above.
(a) the space containing the goods, when the means of transport has already been approved under other customs regulations or recognized by the office of departure as suitable for sealing;
(b) they are so constructed that no goods can be removed or introduced without leaving visible traces of tampering or without breaking the seals;
4. The office of departure may dispense with sealing if, having regard to other possible measures for identification, the description of the goods in the T 1 or T 2 declaration or in the supplementary documents makes them readily identifiable.
1. Until a procedure has been agreed for the exchange of statistical information to ensure that the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community have the data necessary for the preparation of their transit statistics, an additional copy of the copy N° 4 of the T 1 and T 2 documents shall be supplied for statistical purposes unless not required by a Contracting Party:
(b) to the first office of transit in the Community in the case of goods which are the subject of a T 1 or T 2 operation commencing in an EFTA country.
2. However, the additional copy referred to above shall not be required when the goods are carried under the conditions laid down in Chapter I of Title IV of Appendix II.
3. The principal or his authorized representative shall, at the request of the national departments responsible for transit statistics, provide any information relating to T 1 or T 2 documents necessary for the compilation of statistics.
1. The customs authorities of the countries concerned shall furnish each other with any information at their disposal which is of importance in order to verify the proper application of this Convention.
2. Where necessary, the customs authorities of the countries concerned shall communicate to one another all findings, documents, reports, records of proceedings and information relating to transport operations carried out under the T 1 or T 2 procedure as well as to irregularities or infringements in connection with such operations.
Furthermore, where necessary, they shall communicate to one another all findings relating to goods in respect of which mutual assistance is provided for and which have been subject to a customs warehousing procedure.
3. Where irregularities or infringements are suspected in connection with goods which have been brought into one country from another country or have passed through a country or have been stored under a warehousing procedure, the customs authorities of the countries concerned shall on request communicate to one another all information concerning:
- whatever the way in which they were reconsigned, where they arrived under cover of a T 1, T 2 or T 2 L document in the country to which the request is addressed, or
- whatever the way in which they arrived, where they were reconsigned under cover of a T 1, T 2 or T 2 L document from the country to which the request is addressed:
b) the conditions of any warehousing of those goods where they arrived in the country to which the request is addressed under cover of a T 2 or T 2 L document or where they were reconsigned from that country under cover of a T 2 or T 2 L document.
4. Any request made under paragraphs 1 to 3 shall specify the case or cases to which it refers.
5. If the customs authority of a country requests assistance which it would not be able to give if requested, it will draw attention to that fact in the request.
6. Information obtained in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be used solely for the purposes of this Convention and shall be accorded the same protection by a receiving country as is afforded to information of like nature under the national law of that country.
Such information may be used for other purposes only with the written consent of the customs authority which furnished it and subject to any restrictions laid down by that authority.
4. The Joint Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure which shall, inter alia, contain provisions for convening meetings and for the designation of the chairman and his term of office.
