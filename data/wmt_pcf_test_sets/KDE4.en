The Babelfish plugin can be accessed in the & konqueror; menubar under Tools Translate Web Page. Select from the list that drops down the language to translate from and the language to translate to.
If you have a portion of the text on the page selected, that will be translated instead of the entire & URL;.
Machine translation is not a perfect science! Babelfish will at best give you a rough translation, and at worst will give you a very funny read. Do n't base important decisions on things you have read from a Babelfish translated page, without confirming that the translation is indeed accurate.
You may only translate web pages that are accessible on the world wide web. To translate any other text, you should go directly to the Babelfish site itself, where you are able to paste in text for translation.
The & package; package contains several plugins for & konqueror;. Despite their small size, they provide additional functions and ease the use of some of the functions & konqueror; already contains, by making them more accessible.
More information on the use of & konqueror; and its built in functionality, can be found in the & konqueror; handbook.
To load these plugins from within & konqueror;, select Settings Configure Extensions.... Go to the Tools tab and choose the wanted plugins.
This is a list of the standard configuration modules provided by the kde; addons package. Please note that there may be many more modules on your system if you have installed additional software.
You should install the kdebase package which contains & konqueror; before attempting to compile this package.
To use the crashes plugin point & konqueror; to Tools Crashes. Here you can select to view the site that & konqueror; has crashed on or clear the list of crashes, if any.
The View Filter plugin (also known as dirfilter) can be accessed in the & konqueror; menubar under Tools View Filter. This plugin allows you to filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in a variety of ways.
To begin using The DOM Tree Viewer in & konqueror;, select Tools Show DOM Tree. This will open a new window which displays the DOM of the current web page you are viewing. By default the display starts at the root node of the document, example: documentElement, all other nodes that you will see are children or descendants of the root node.
The & fsview; Plugin for & konqueror; is another view mode for objects of mimetype inode/ directory for local files. It can be viewed as an alternative to the various iconviews and listviews for browsing the content of your local file system.
The unique property of & fsview; is its ability to show whole nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map for graphical visualization. Tree maps allow for displaying metrics of objects in nested structures: each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its metric. The sum of the children's metrics must be equal to or smaller than the parent object's metric.
For & fsview;, sizes of files and folders are chosen as metric, where the size of a folder is defined to be the sum of the sizes of its subitems. This way, big files even deep down in the folder hierarchy can be spotted easily be looking for large rectangles. So & fsview; can be looked at as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; du command.
In & fsview;, an item of the tree map visualization is a rectangle representing a file or folder of your file system. For easier navigation, rectangles have a meaningful coloring and labeling options.
The color of a rectangle, switchable via menu item View Color Mode can be either Depth for easy detection of the nesting, or a color mapping of different file attributes like name, owner, group, or mime type.
A rectangle can be labeled with the various attributes of the corresponding file or folder. For an attribute, you can choose, whether it should be shown at all, only if space is available, or if space should be taken from children (thus introducing errors to pure tree map drawing constrains). Additionally, you can choose the relative location of the label in the rectangle.
For drawing algorithms in tree maps, the rule that the area is proportional to the metric of an item should hold true. With the tree map in & fsview;, this goal is n't always met: we draw borders to show the nesting of items, and this border takes space for a item which is possible lost for the areas of child items. Note that less space is lost for the border if the rectangle is quadratic.
How the space of an item is split into subareas for children is left to the implementation. It is always better to try to split areas in such a way that rectangles are as quadratic as possible, both for labeling and less space lost by borders. The best methods in this regard are Rows, Columns, or Recursive Bisection.
You can choose the minimal area of items to be drawn via the menu item View Stop at Area. Instead, a hash pattern will be drawn over the parents area to signal that this space is in fact occupied by a child.
Originally, & fsview; was meant as a small test application and usage tutorial for the TreeMap widget developed within KCachegrind.
The Image Gallery plugin can be accessed in the & konqueror; menubar under Tools Create Image Gallery, or with Ctrl; I.
When you start the Image Gallery plugin a dialog opens allowing you to adjust the way the gallery is created.
The Page title option has a text input box for changing the title of the image gallery page.
The Images per row option has a slider and a spin box for adjusting the number of thumbnails that are in a single row in the gallery.
The Show image file name check box allows you to turn on or off the use of the filenames below the gallery thumbnails.
The Show image filesize check box allows you to turn on or off the use of the filesizes below the gallery thumbnails.
The Show image dimensions check box allows you to turn on or off the use of the image dimensions in pixels below the gallery thumbnails.
The Folders dialog is used for choosing where to save the gallery. This dialog is also used to configure what folders are used.
The Save to file selector decides where you want to save you image gallery html page.
The Recurse subfolders check box enables recursing of subdirectories. If the check box is enabled, a slider and spin box are enabled to select the recursion depth.
The Copy original files check box creates an image folder storing copies of the original images used in the gallery.
The use comment file check box enables a file selector to choose a comments file to use with your gallery.
The set different color depth check box enables a combo box for selecting a different color depth for the thumbnails if you wish to use a color depth other than the depth used in the original image.
The & HTML; Settings plugin provides an easy way to access the common & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.
The & HTML; settings plugin can be accessed in the & konqueror; menubar under Tools HTML Settings. Below is a list of the settings and a short description of each one.
The Sidebar Media Player can be accessed in the & konqueror; menubar under Window Show Navigation Panel or by using the F9 shortcut.
To use, click the on the navigation panel in & konqueror;, and drag-and-drop any music files you wish to listen to into the mediaplayer.
The uachanger adds a menu to & konqueror; that allows you to change the Browser and Operating System identification on a domain-by-domain basis. This is useful when browsing websites that limit access to those using a particular web browser.
The default User Agent header for & konqueror; is Mozilla/ 5.0(compatible; Konqueror/ 3.2)(KHTML, like Gecko). If you come across a site that refuses this browser access, change your User Agent to one of the options below.
Allows you to change your User Agent header to MSIE for sites that refuse Mozilla -based browsers entry. You will most likely need to use one of the MSIE User Agents if you wish to use & konqueror; to access Hotmail.
Pages that do n't comply with W3C recommendations, or were written using proprietary & HTML; elements and attributes will render correctly if you choose to send the User Agent of these old browsers.
This option allows you to specify that the defined User Agent applies across every page on the site you are visiting.
Selecting Configure allows you to fine tune the amount of information you wish to reveal about the browser and operating system being used.
The & konqueror; validator plugin checks your & CSS; and & HTML; documents for conformance to W3C recommendations and other standards.
The validator plugin can be accessed in the & konqueror; menubar under Tools Validate Web Page. A description of each subitem can be found below.
The validate & HTML; option allows you to compare your & HTML; document to the defined syntax of & HTML; and reports any errors found. Validating your & HTML; will ensure that your pages display properly on all browsers.
Allows you to validate your & CSS; style sheet that is embedded in an & HTML; or & XHTML; document. Having valid & CSS; is critical to ensuring that your web site maintains a consistent look regardless of the browser that is being used.
Allows you to confirm that the links on your site contain no redirects or broken links. This tool recursively checks all links on a site.
The configure validator item allows you to view the preset validators you can use to validate your & HTML; and & CSS;.
The webarchiver plugin for & konqueror; allows for archiving of web pages, documents and images in. war format.
To access the webarchiver point your mouse to Tools Archive Web Page.... A dialog will appear allowing you to save the current website being viewed.
The webarchiver plugin is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik schlpbch@iam. unibe. ch larossa@kde. org malte@kde. org
An easy-to-use Camera interface is provided, that will connect to your digital camera and download photographs directly into & digikam; Albums. More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. Of course, any media or card reader supported by your operating system will interface with & digikam;.
& digikam; incorporates a fast Image Editor with many image editing tools. You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs, comment and rate them, correct, enhance and alter them. The editing power can be easily extended by a set of plugins, the Kde Image Plugins Interface (manual)
While & digikam; remains easy to use, it provides professional level features by the dozens. It is fully 16 bit enabled including all available plugins, supports RAW format conversion through libraw, DNG export and ICC color management work flow.
Improved database with many more metadata that can be searched, & eg; camera or lens
Like the rest of & kde;, & digikam; is an Open Source project. This means that it relies on its users to play their part by, at least, reporting problems and suggesting possible improvements.
& digikam; makes it as easy as possible for you to report bugs or suggest improvements. Wherever you are in the application the Help menu will include a Report Bugs option. This will display a message box with a highlighted link. Click on the link and your web browser will open the page for the reporting system. All the information required will already be filled in, just follow the instructions for completing your report.
& digikam; is a community supported project, which means that users and developers support one another. If you become a regular user of & digikam; you are encouraged to join the & digikam; Users Mailing List. You can start off by asking questions of other & digikam; users and hopefully soon you will be answering the support questions of others.
You can also visit the digikam; Home Page. for news of new releases and other & digikam; related information.
The best way to start getting involved with & digikam; is to join the Developers Mailing List. digikam; Developer Mailing List joining instructions.
When you start & digikam; for the very first time it will ask you where you store your photographs and the & digikam; database. You can choose any local, remote or removable folder. Just type in the path name of a folder or click on the folder icon Folder Icon to select a folder from the dialog.
In the second box you have to specify a local folder that resides on your computer, in which the database will be stored. This path will be the same for all image folders.
Lateron you can add as many locations as you like - & digikam; will add them to the album library. Settings Configure Collections
If you already have a collection of photographs on your hard disk, you can enter the top-level folder containing the photographs, this is called the Albums Library folder. & digikam; will treat each sub-folder of the folder you've entered as an Album. None of the photographs will be altered. During folders parsing you can see a progress dialog like this:
& digikam; will recurse the library path to its full depth. You cannot exclude (prune) any sub-path unless you make that sub-path hidden. You have to do that from outside of & digikam; by putting a dot in front of the sub-path.
When you use an existing folder of photographs, as the Album Library folder, you will notice that the Albums in the Album list do not have photographs as their icons. You can change that by dragging any photograph in the Album onto the folder icon in the left sidebar and use this as the Album icon. See the Album section for details of how to change the Album icon.
Once you have configured the Album Library Folder you can set up & digikam; to work with your digital camera. Then learn how to use Albums and Tags to arrange your photograph Albums.
RAW file support: if you are using RAW shooting mode with your camera, & digikam; is probably well able to deal with it. RAW support depends on the libraw library. To find out if your particular camera is supported, bring up the list of supported RAW cameras from the Help RAW camera support menu.
How to setup and work with RAW files is described in RAW Decoder Settings and RAW Workflow.
An easy-to-use camera interface is provided, that will connect to your digital camera and download photographs directly into & digikam; Albums. More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. Of course, any media or card reader supported by your operating system will interface with & digikam;.
Current digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-link) for data transmission. The actual transfers to a host computer are commonly carried out using the USB Mass Storage device class (so that the camera appears as a disk drive) or using the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. Older cameras may use the Serial Port (RS-232) connection.
& digikam; employs the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital still cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable set of digital camera software applications which supports a growing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 has support for the Picture Transfer Protocol, which is a widely supported protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association to allow the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional device drivers.
Many old digital still cameras used Serial Port to communicate with host computer. Because photographs are big files and serial port transfers are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs image transfers using the gPhoto2 program. You can find a complete list of supported digital cameras at this url.
libgphoto2 needs to be built with libexif to retrieve thumbnails to digiKam properly. EXIF support is required for thumbnail retrieval on some libgphoto2 camera drivers. If EXIF supported is not set with libgphoto2, you might not see thumbnails or the thumbnail extraction might be very slow.
One of the nicest things about & digikam; is how easily its functionality can be extended, by using plugins:
Kipi Plugins: the Kde Image Plugins Interface project (Kipi) (manual) is an effort to develop a common plugin structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. Its aim is to share image plugins among graphical applications. Kipi-Plugins setup is described in this section.
Plugins can manipulate images in almost any way that users can. Their advantage is, that it is much easier to add a capability to & digikam; by writing a small plugin than by modifying the & digikam; core.
To unclutter the interface, either toggle the sidebars away with a & LMB;, or use the full screen view mode (F11, Ctrl+Shift+F).
Drag and Drop of images works about everywhere: damp; d an image into another branch of the album tree, across the horizontal album separation line, or to another application window. The only restriction is that you cannot damp; d into tag, date or searches.
- a file type selector lets you single out the most common ones: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, RAW, movies and audio
The text filter is only used for those fields which are actually displayed in the icon view. E. g. filename matching only works if filenames are displayed. The fields which are displayed can be configured in the album settings dialog.
The & quot; Albumsquot; tree provides an organized view of your photograph albums. All photographs that are managed by & digikam; are stored in a single folder branch. The albums can be sorted by their folder layout on the hard disk, by the Collection name that has been set in the Album Properties or by the Date of that Albums (this date can also be changed in the Properties of each Album).
If you have a scanner configured, you can also scan a photograph straight into an Album. Select Import Import from Scanner....
Simply drag the photograph and drop it on the destination Album to move or copy it from one Album to another. A menu will appear that gives you the option to Move or Copy the photograph. You can move or copy multiple photographs the same way, just select all the photographs that you want to move and drag them on to the destination Album.
An Album contains a set of photographs. Album Properties allows you to set information about this set. To access the Album Properties right-click on an Album and select Edit Album Properties from the context menu.
The Album Collection: this is a way of grouping your Albums together by a common label. The Collection you set will be used to order your albums when you select By Collection from the drop down box in the tool bar or using View Sort Albums By Collection. If you want to add and delete Collection labels, use the Collection Settings dialog.
The Album Date: this will be used when you order your Albums by date using View Sort Albums By Date.
Oldest, Average, Newest buttons: these will set the Date to the oldest, average or latest date of the images in that album. It will first try to calculate the average date of the images in the album based on the EXIF-headers. If that fails it will fall back to the modification date of the files in that folder.
When you first view an Album, & digikam; selects the first photograph in the Album as the icon to display in the & quot; Albumsquot; list. This helps you remember what kind of photographs are contained in an Album. Sometimes the first photograph in the Album is not the most representative and you want to select a different one as the Album icon.
To select a different photograph as the Album icon, right-click on the photograph that you want to use as the Album icon and select & quot; Set as Album Thumbnailquot; from the context menu. Additionally you can use drag and drop to set the Album icon. Drag the photographs icon and drop it on the currently selected Album in the Album list.
An Album can only be in one Album Collection and Album Collections cannot be nested.
& digikam; also supports tagging individual photographs using the "My Tags" area at the left of the main window. Album Collections are different from photograph tagging because the Album Collection applies to all the photographs in an Album rather than to individual photographs. You can use both Album Collections and tagging to organize your photographs.
The Image Window provides the main view of your images. When you select an Album the images contained in that Album will be displayed in the Image Window. Each image is displayed as a thumbnail. You can alter the size of the thumbnails using the magnifier slider in the lower right of the status bar.
The first time you select an Album you may have to wait briefly while the thumbnails are generated, unless you used the Tools Rebuild all Thumbnails... menu item beforehand.
Information about each photograph is displayed below each thumbnail. You can control what information is displayed from the Settings Configure & digikam; dialog. Select the Album View page and look for the Icon-View Options section.
The thumbnails have Tool Tips which will pop up if you allow the mouse to dwell over a thumbnail for a moment. The Tool Tip shows the most important properties of the photograph including any tags that you have applied. The screenshot at the top of the Introduction to the Main Window section shows a Tool Tip being displayed.
Photographs are what & digikam; is all about. Albums and Tags allow you to organize and find your photographs in a way that suits you. You can access all of the functions that & digikam; can perform on a photograph by right-clicking the thumbnail (context menu) or by selecting from the Image menu in the menu bar. You have the choice between viewing the images, viewing by slide show, or of editing the images.
You can open the Image Editor on a photograph either using F4 Image Edit... or by right-clicking and selecting Edit from the context menu. See the digikam; Image Editor section for instructions on how to edit your photographs. The Image Editor lets you view your photographs and make a number of adjustments to them.
Sometimes & digikam; may not provide all of the capabilities you need. You can open a photograph in another application by right-clicking on it and selecting from the Open With sub-menu. The list of applications that appear in this menu is controlled by the standard & kde; file associations for the image format type of this photograph. Consult the & kde; manual for instructions on changing these file associations if the application that you need is not listed.
Note that there can be a problem with meta-data embedded in photographs when they are edited by other image manipulation applications. Some applications do not retain the photograph's meta-data when you save a modified image. This means that if you modify a photograph using one of these programs you will lose information such as orientation, aperture & etc;. that are stored in the EXIF and IPCT tags.
& digikam; provides two ways to get your photographs the right way up. The simplest method is to right-click the thumbnail and select Rotate and then pick the correct amount of rotation needed.
You can change the filename for a photograph by right-clicking a thumbnail and selecting F2 Rename. Remember to keep the file extension (. jpg,. tif, & etc;).
When you delete a photograph from & digikam; it will be moved to the & kde; Trash Can. F8 Image Delete or Delete If you prefer that Delete really removes the photograph completely, than you can do that by Shift; Delete
The & quot; Datesquot; view organizes your photographs based on their dates. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if no EXIF date is available, the last modification time of the file.
When you select a month from the list, all images from that month are displayed in the Image View. You can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the Date View to show only the images from the selected dates.
(Hierarchical) tagging provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your images. Tags are labels that can be applied to individual images or whole groups. Once a tag has been set to an image it can be found again by selecting the tag or doing a search.
When a tag is selected, all of the images that are marked with that tag are displayed.
Tags can be arranged in a hierarchical tree. This allows you to organize your tags in a logical manner. One can collapse parts of the tree in the & quot; Tagsquot; list so that one can easily find the tags that you are looking for.
Tags are stored in a database for fast access, and, the applied tags are written into IPTC data fields of the image (at least for JPEG). So can use your tags with other programs or, in case of loss of that data in the database, the tags will be re-imported when the image is noticed by & digikam;.
You can add new tags by right-clicking on either the & quot; Tagsquot; label or an existing tag and selecting New Tag. If you add a new tag by right-clicking on an existing tag, your new tag will be created as a sub-tag.
You can delete a Tag by right-clicking on the Tag you want to delete and selecting Delete Tag. When you delete a tag, the photographs themselves are not deleted. Simply the tag is removed from those photographs.
You can move the position of a Tag within the tree by dragging it to the position that you want and dropping it there. A menu will appear that gives you the option to Move the tag. This works from the left and right sidebar. A tag can only be in one place in the tree at a time.
You can set the Tag Properties by right-clicking on a Tag and selecting Edit Tag Properties. The Tag Properties allow you to change the name of the tag and the icon used in the & quot; Tagsquot; tree.
To select a different photograph as the tag icon, right-click on the photograph that you want to use as the tag icon and select "Set as Tag Thumbnail" from the context menu. Additionally you can use drag and drop to set the tag icon. Drag the images icon and drop it on the currently selected tag in the tag list.
Before you can get the most out of & digikam; 's Tagging capabilities, you must first tag your photographs. There are two methods of tagging photographs. Once you have identified the photographs that you want to tag you can either drag and drop them onto the Tag in the "My Tags" tree or, by right-clicking on the selected photographs in the Image Window, you can use the Assign Tag menu to select the Tags you wish to set.
You can label a photograph with as many tags as you like. The photograph will appear when you select any of the tags that are set against it. This way you can set a tag for each person in a photograph, as well as the place the photograph was taken, the event it was taken at, & etc;.
Once you have tagged a photograph, the tag name will appear under the thumbnail in the Image Window.
You can remove a tag from a photograph by right-clicking on the photograph and using the Remove Tag menu. This menu will only show those tags that have been set on this photograph.
The timeline view shows a timescale-adjustable histogram of the numbers of images per time unit. A selection frame moves over the histogram. To select a time frame just click into the lower square of the selection frame where the time unit is indicated. That will show all corresponding images in the main window.
In the field right below you can enter a title and save your selection. It will then appear in the list field at the bottom.
include all elements of the database: names, rating, keywords, tags, albums, collections, dates (and more in the future)
Next to the search box is a little LED that turns green if the search has results. Just click on it to reset the filtering and show all images again. If the search is not succeessful, the LED turns red.
The more sophisticated search tool is a tab on the left sidebar (binocular icon). If you open it, you will be presented with a simple search box the works as described above, except that you can save this search as a live folder that always filters for what you entered as search criteria. When saved, the filter will appear in the list.
When you are satisfied with your selection, click on the Ok button, and the search will be carried out, and the results displayed in "My Search" view from the main window. The Save search as text field will be used to label your query in "My Search" list. If you want to modify your selection after performing a search, simply right click on the item from "My Search" view and select an option from the pop-up menu.
If you select Edit Search, the search form will re-appear, containing your previous search information. If you select Edit as Advanced Search, the advanced search tool dialog will be come up to modify your previous search information using more elaborate search rules. See the The Advanced Search Tool section for more information.
If you want to remove an existing search from the list, just select Delete Search from the pop-up menu.
Advanced Search tool provides an extended search form with a wealth of search parameters, which can be used to search in specific fields of the & digikam; albums database.
The Search Rules list is used to set all options to process a search query in the albums database. All rules are listed vertically and separated by an operator. An option can be added or deleted to the list using Add Search Group/ Remove Group. Each option can be combined with another one using Meet all.. or Meet any... or one of these... At least one... logical operators. Thus, one can construct searches of the type & quot; AND NOTquot;.
& digikam; characterizes every image by a legthy number using a special technique (Haar algorithm) that make it possible to compare images by comparing this calculated signature. The less numerical difference there is between any two image signatures, the more they resemble each other. This technique has three implementations
Similar items: This is a dragamp; drop zone where you can drop any image to find a similar one. A threshold can be modified in order to narrow down or enlarge the resulting selection. Drag an image from anywhere over the fuzzy search icon in the left sidebar, it will open and you drop it there.
Sketch: free hand color sketching: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; will find corresponding images. Again a threshold can be set.
This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the marble widget. You can zoom in and out with the mousewheel by either scrolling it or hold and drag it. Pan by holding down the left mouse button. Press the Ctrl; left mouse button to pull-up a square as indicated. All images falling within the coordinates of that square will be filtered and shown (provided your images have been geo-coded of course).
In the box below you can enter a name for your geo filter. It will be added to the list view below for future reference, it acts as a live geo folder.
& digikam; features a light table in a separate window to easily compare images. It works with all supported image formats including RAW files.
Select one or several images in any view from the main window, call Ctrl; L Place onto Light Table from the context menu. The selection will be added to the light table, and its separate window will open. When you are back to the & digikam; main window you can quickly access the light table with L Tools.
From the thumbbar drag & drop images to the left and right comparison pane below. A little arrow will indicate which copy is shown in which pane. If you choose Synchronize Preview from the toolbar, any zoom and panning in one window will be synchronously executed in the other pane, so that you can compare the same areas of two images.
Another mode is better suited for quickly culling from a series of images. If you choose Navigate by Pair from the toolbar, the first two images will be automatically inserted into the comparison panes. Click on any thumbnail to make it the left side preview, the adjacent thumbnail to the right will be inserted into the right pane. That make it easy to sift through a series of similar images.
Of course, the usual delete actions work from the light table directly as well as F4 File Edit....
All image information from the main window right sidebar is available for each of the two previews in the light table. This makes it easy to link visual differences to exposure data for example.
In the lower right corner of each pane there you find a built-in panning action (crossed arrows). Click on it and keep the & LMB; pressed to pan across the image (in synchronous mode both images will show the same viewing port).
Zooming works the same as in other views: use indifferently the zoom slider below the panes or Ctrl; scroll wheel to zoom in and out, with both images when in synchronous mode.
What is digital asset management - apart from a buzz word? Digital Asset Management (DAM) refers to every part of the process that follows the taking of the picture, all the way through the final output and permanent storage. Anyone who shoots, scans or stores digital photographs is practicing some form of DAM, but most of us are not doing so in a systematic or efficient way.
We present a tool, a plan and practical advice on how to file, find, protect and re-use photographs, focusing on best practices for digital photographers using & digikam;. We cover downloading, renaming, culling, converting, grouping, backing-up, rating, tagging, archiving, optimizing, maintaining and exporting image files.
& quot; Digital Asset Management ingests, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports content that has monetary or cultural value. quot;
Metadata is defined as data about data. Metadata is definitional data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed within an application or environment.
I dare-say if you have more than 1000 photographs on your computer in no-DAM fashion it takes you too long to find any particular image. And if you do n't know how many images are in your files you're surely not using & digikam;. The dual approach to store metadata in a database and in the image files guarantees ultra fast searching and secure archiving freely accessible to other applications, platforms and formats.
The first thing to do and to know before you put anything onto your system is a to build an information structure (as opposed to data structure). Your image files have to be somehow organized within the computer, you have to decide if others should have access to your photographs (sharing), if you put them on a dedicated drive, on a network drive & etc; Keep in mind that you have to migrate one day onto some bigger volume.
Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. Holiday pictures can be quickly found by its location (unless you go to the same place every year), the rest will be organized by date. If you shoot enough pictures you want to create sub folders below the years as months & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; 'Export 'would be a container for images to print or to put onto a website.
The more professional photographer will have very different needs as there will be versions of photographs, archives, workflows, a constant influx of images of diverging themes, and a large quantity of everything. Within 10 year you'll have 95% archives and 5% work space files and you do n't want to organize your structure around content!
what kind of files go together? Segregation of file type makes batch processing easier. Keep new and old files separate.
Segregation of original and working files makes it easier to allocate the backup strategy and migration. You will always know if you look for an original or a derivative.
I also recommend to switch-on the'save metadata 'options in the & digikam; settings page for metadata. This will ensure that EXIF and IPTC data is written into the file. If you forgot to do that you can always catch up by copying the metadata in the database to the files in one go (from the album menu).
Now we have a lot of stuff already in our database, but what if I need to change some of it? & digikam; provides a metadata editor for a selected number of attributes, the most important ones of course.
The real works begins here as we will apply tags, captions and a rating to every photograph. Of course, all images requiring the same attribute can be treated as a selection in one action. Lets start with rating or ranking. It's best to start with ranking because for further work you can concentrate on the good shots.
Lets continue with tags (or keywords as called by other applications, or categories, they are all synonymous).
When you import cataloged images from other sources having embedded tags already, & digikam; will automatically create the trees for you, respectively insert it into the right place. Rearranging the hierarchy within the tree is no problem, you can do that easily by dragging and dropping a sub-tree to another place in the hierarchy. The changed tags will be updated as & digikam; ripples down the branches.
The graphics here shows how different metadata overlap. This is a very coarse representation, as each block of metadata will in itself be subdivided into many sections. File names and calendar data are properties of all images.
Enough of tags - lets move on to captions or comments, the third major tool for metadata cataloging.
You rarely want nobody to see your photographs. You rather want to share them with friends, your family, other photographers, agencies, put them onto the internet. And do n't tell me you're not interested as to how your photos are being received!
Lets look at this panorama. From far it is not even a nice beach panorama. If you go closer you start to see some details, people, the space.
And now I tell you that this is the Allies landing site & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after the disembarkation. Wow! One starts to dream, have associations, memories, the historical time span is present, you may hear the silence. The caption has totally reframed to perception of this panorama.
For others to appreciate your photographs, the title is probably more important than the image itself for the interest it creates. When you show pictures, tell a story. Remember that the key is to convey the meaning to viewers, to help them understand what you understand about the subject and what moved you.
it's okay if the image is less than perfect because it has the strength to stand on its own merit described in the caption.
With & digikam; you can enter unlimited amounts of text using internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as caption. You can enter it for a selection of photos at the same time. KDE even provides a spell checker. When you export images to web galleries, the captions will be exported at choice into either/ or/ and caption/ title of the web gallery system, no need to re-write the story for publishing.
Do you still remember the times before GPS? When you would find your way to another city without navigation system? Was n't the earth a dull blue ball before GoogleEarth? Well then, with images, the train of spatial representation is running at cruising speed alright.
The possibilities of exploiting this geolocation are already innumerable and will become pervasive in the future. I'm sure one day not too far away we can revisit in a virtual reality our travels through geo-tagged pictures. The & digikam; features include exporting to kml files that can be opened by GoogleEarth (which in turn will show the photos on their shooting site), exporting to gallery2, picasaweb, flickr & etc; with GoogleMaps viewer and more.
& quot; Copyleft is a play on the word copyright and is the practice of using copyright law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified versions of a work for others and requiring that the same freedoms be preserved in modified versions.
And here follows a description of what should be supplied to & digikam; 's setup page as information:
Author (synonymous with Creator and By-line): This field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photograph. If it is not appropriate to add the name of the photographer (for example, if the identity of the photographer needs to be protected) the name of a company or organization can also be used. Once saved, this field should not be changed by anyone. This field does not support the use of commas or semi-colons as separator.
Author title (synonymous with By-line title): Linked to Author. This field should contain the job title of the photographer. Examples might include titles such as: Staff Photographer, Freelance Photographer, or Independent Commercial Photographer. Since this is a qualifier for the Author field, the Author field must also be filled out.
Credit (synonymous to Provider): Use the Provider field to identify who is providing the photograph. This does not necessarily have to be the author. If a photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or the Associated Press, these organizations could be listed here as they are'providing 'the image for use by others. If the image is a stock photograph, then the group (agency) involved in supplying the image should be listed here.
Whereas it is paramount to fill-in the author and copyright sections, they represent no protection against fraud. Anyone with a bit more than basic computer knowledge is able to delete or modify image embedded metadata. The solution to this problem is called'digital watermarking '. To private persons this might be of little interest for the majority of photographs, but for professionals ans semi-professionals this protection is really important.
The digital watermark will be unique per image. & digikam; will provide a plugin for DW in the near future that features batch processing.
Themes: disk errors, disk failures, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, storage media deterioration, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, common myths
Of course we're not talking about losing CDs on the road or in a fire - that kind of loss is just the same as traditional paper copies or negatives. We are talking about problems with the so called "New Media".
Kroll Ontrack, the worlds largest data recovery firm, have some interesting statistics on what actually causes data loss.
To combat the problem of CDs/ DVDs, they need to be properly cared for and not trusted for more than a few years. Thankfully you can purchase archive-quality CDs and DVDs which last longer, though they are much more difficult to obtain and are much more expensive. There are offers out there for gold-plated DVDs, & dollar; 2 a piece claiming 100 years storage life (if you care to believe it).
CD/ DVD disks may become unreadable, but you can reduce the risk using good disks and a good recorder, and storing them in a correct way. The best DVD recorders are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but they write in a much more reliable way. It's a matter of choosing the right one.
Essentially, CDs and DVDs are very prone to errors, even in a freshly written state. That's why they are heavily protected with a checksum mechanism (75% of data are effective data, the rest is formatting and checksum overhead). But even with that massive amount of protection they will suffer deterioration from chemical aging, ultra-violet exposure, scratches, dust, & etc;
For damaged CDs and DVDs, there is an inexpensive program called IsoBuster from which will do seeming miracles on CDs and DVDs. It runs on Windows and & Linux;; but not (yet) on Macs. Similarly, there are applications designed to get data from damaged floppies, hard drives, flash media such as camera memory and USB drives, and so forth.
Optical media: Blu-ray disks seem to win the format war against'HD DVD '. A dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB, almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD at 8.5 GB. Everything that has been said about CDs/ DVDs applies to Blu-ray disks as well.
Burn them slowly with a good recorder on archive quality media in an open, non-proprietary format, read the data back to verify, label them with some descriptive text + date & author, lock them away where it is clean, dark, animal safe and dry. And do not forget to copy them over to the next generation of media before you throw away your last piece of hardware or software able to read them.
Disk manufacturers keep their statistics to themselves. A manufacturer guaranty buys you a new disk, but no data. Google for one has done a large scale study on HDD failure mechanisms: Disk Failures study
In a nutshell: Disks run longest when operating between 35°C and 45°C, at lower temperatures the error rates increases dramatically. Controller parts (electronics) are the foremost sources of failure, SMART does not diagnose any of this. Some SMART errors are indicative of imminent failure, in particular scan errors and relocation counts. Lifetime expectancy is 4-5 years.
(This is about total data loss due to power surges. Of course you can have the occasional data loss due to power loss before saving files. But those losses can normally be restored without major difficulty.)
While most average electricity-using devices are not affected by power surges, devices relying on computer chips and high-speed microprocessors are susceptible to serious damage. For your computer, power anomalies can result in keyboard lockup, complete data loss, hardware degradation, damaged motherboards, and more. Failure to protect yourself from the inevitable can result in a loss of both time and money.
The most common defense against power surges is a surge protector or suppressor, a device that works by absorbing some of the excess energy and diverting the rest of it to the ground. These are usually found in the form of a power strip (one of those long devices that have six or so outlets and a single, grounded plug). Bear in mind, however, that not every power strip serves as a surge protector.
When selecting your surge protector, you want to be sure it is listed as meeting the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. You should also look for one that offers protection against lightning (not every one does) and provides insurance for equipment that is properly attached.
Because a power surge can follow any path to your computer, be sure that each peripheral connected to your system is protected. This includes your phone line or cable modem, as power can surge through these routes as well. A number of manufacturers are now producing surge suppressors that feature a phone jack for your modem along with the electrical outlets, while others have coaxial cable jacks for those who use a cable modem or TV tuner card.
If you have a notebook computer, you will want to carry a surge suppressor as well. A variety of suppressors designed specifically for notebooks are available, small in size and possessing both electric and phone outlets that make them ideal for use on the road.
While a surge suppressor will protect your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it won ’ t help you if the power should black out completely. Even an outage of just a few seconds can result in the loss of valuable data, so you might find it worthwhile to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.
Besides serving as surge suppressors, these devices automatically switch to battery power when a power outage occurs, giving you the opportunity to save data and shut down your system. Some models will even allow you to keep working until power is restored. When purchasing a UPS, be sure that it has the same qualities that you would seek in a surge suppressor, but also check out the battery life and included software.
Considering the potential risk to your computing system, ensuring its safety from power disturbances is a worthwhile investment. A quality surge suppressor will cost you upward of & euro; 20, a 500W UPS can be had for less than & euro; 40. It ’ s a small cost to pay for the peace of mind you’ ll gain knowing your computer is well protected. In the very least pull all lines to your computer when you go on holidays.
Amazon Web Services includes S3 - Simple Storage Service. With appropriate configuration, you can mount S3 as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows systems, allowing you to use it as a backup destination for your favorite software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer where one can store infinite amount of data.
It is expensive compared to hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 a year, 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. And you have to transfer the images over the (a comparatively slow) internet.
I think as a safeguard against localized data loss of the most essential images it's not a bad idea at all, but it is not a general backup solution, much too slow for that.
Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and Foto-Community 23hq. com provide online storage services specialist on photographie. Their free space is limited to 1 GB and you do n't want to have full resolution images online. But the pro-accounts offer more, in the case of Flickr, dramatically more. For a mere 25$ a year you get unlimited (sic! reality check needed here) space.
In terms of data retention the web space solution is probably pretty safe. Transmission errors are corrected (thanks to the TCP protocol) and the big companies usually have backup included plus distributed storage so that they are disaster proof within themselves.
This diagram depicts the transmission chain elements in a computer, all transitions are susceptible to transmission errors. The zfs and btrfs file system at least ensure the OS to disk path of data integrity.
The worst of all that is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurs, not your hardware. All those glitches go down unheard until one day you open the photograph, and to your surprise it's broken. It is quite worrisome that there should be no protection within a computer, nobody seems to have thought of it. The internet (TCP protocol) is much saver as a data path than inside a computer.
Flaky power supplies are another source of transmission losses because they create interference with the data streams. With normal files systems those errors go unnoticed.
Even if you are not overly concerned today with transmission problems, have a look into the future at illustration. Already in 2010 we'll see thousands of errors per year!
ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates to deal with disk errors on a low level, and it is highly scalable. It is Open Source, heavily patented, comes with an GPL incompatible license, and is available on Solaris and Leopard. Let us hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows (article).
Oracle has also started an initiative with its btrfs file system, which still is in an alpha stage. It employs the same protection technique as zfs does, and it's available on & Linux;, although it is not yet part of the stock kernel.
Do not underestimate it! Those two factor account for 86% of notebook and 46% for desktop system data losses. For notebooks, theft counts for 50% alone.
Data loss due to viruses is less grave than common wisdom make you believe. It accounts for less damage than theft or re-installations, for example. And it is limited to Microsoft OS users. Apple users experience very few viruses and under & Linux; they have n't been around for quite some time now.
Open Source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: Wrong, NTFS is rather a tiny notch better than ext3, ReiserFs, JFS, XFS, to name just the most popular file systems that often come as default FS with distributions. A brilliant article about it is here: link
Journaling files systems prevent data corruption/ loss: Wrong, they only speed up the scan process in case of a sudden interrupt during operation and prevent ambiguous states. But if a file was not entirely saved before the mishap, it'll be lost.
Viruses are the biggest thread to digital data: Wrong. Theft, and human errors are the primary cause of data loss.
Digital camera sensors are 1-2 aperture stops away from fundamental physical limitations. What I mean is this: as technology evolves, there is a natural limit to its progress. Sensitivity and noise characteristics for any kind of light sensor are not far from that limit.
Today's cameras tend towards 10 mega pixels sensors, although this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and deteriorates the end result. Given the sensor size and quality of optics, 6 mega pixels are optimum for compact cameras. Even DSLR cameras run into their limits at 10-12 mega pixels, for higher resolutions one has to go for full frame sensors (24x36mm) or even bigger formats.
A 750GB HD costs & euro; 100 today. Do not blame anybody else for data loss! 6% of all PCs will suffer an episode of data loss in any given year. Backup your data often according to a plan, and back it up and test the backup before you do anything dramatic like re-installing your OS, changing disks, resizing partitions and so on.
Say, you religiously do your backups every day on a external SATA drive. Then comes the day where lightning strikes. Happy you if the external drive was not connected at that moment!
Disasters strike locally and destroy a lot. Forget about airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, kids and theft are dangerous enough to our data. They usually cover a whole room or house.
Therefore disaster control means de-localized storage. Move your backups upstairs, next house, to your bureau (and vise versa), whatever.
There is another good aspect to the physical separation: as said above, panic is often the cause of destroying data, even the backup data. Having a backup not at hand right away may safe your ass one day.
Full Backup: A complete backup of all the files being backed up. It is a snapshot without history, it represents a full copy at one point in time.
Differential Backup: A backup of only the files that have changed since the last full backup. Constitutes a full snapshot of two points in time: the full backup and the last differential one.
Incremental Backup: A backup of only the files that have changed since last whatever backup. Constitutes multiple snapshots. You can recreate the original state at any point in time such a backup was made. This comes closest to a versioning system except that it is only sampled and not continuous.
Rsync is a wonderful little utility that's amazingly easy to set up on your machines. Rather than have a scripted FTP session, or some other form of file transfer script - rsync copies only the differences of files that have actually changed, compressed and through ssh if you want to for security. That's a mouthful.
backup important images right away (after dumping them to a computer) to DVD/ optical media
This protocol tries to leave you enough time to spot losses and to recover fully at the same time keeping the backup volume at & lt; 130% of the working space. You end up with a daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month, and a snapshot of every month. Any more thinning should be done by hand after a full verification.
Themes: metadata, IPTC stored in image files, XMP files associated, keep the originals, storage, scalability, media, retrieval of images and metadata, copying image data over to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing device... use of the www.
In order for your valuable images to survive the next 40 years or so (because that's about the time that you will become really interested to revisit those nice old photographs of you as a child, adolescent & etc;) there are two strategies to be observed:
As the future is unforeseeable by nature, everything said today is to be taken with caution, and to be reviewed as we advance. Unfortunately there is no shortcut possible to some basic vigilance. Every 5-8 years at least one should ask oneself the question of backwards compatibility of current systems. The less variants we used in the past the less questions are to be answered in the future.
Basically the questions should be answered along the line explained in this document: use and change to open standards supported by a manifold of applications.
Virtualization becomes available now for everybody. So if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it, install it as a virtual machine for later.
Otherwise the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, your file format, check it out, go through your library and convert to a newer standard if necessary. And keep to open standards.
Scalability is the tech-geek expression of the (easy) capability of a system to be resized, which always means up-sized.
Lets assume you planned for scalability and dedicated the container you want to increase to a separate disk or partition. On *nix systems like & Linux; you then can copy and resize the container to the new disk:
Check with dmesg if your new disk is recognized by the system, but do n't mount it.
& dollar; dd if=/ dev/ sdb[#] of=/ dev/ sdc # source is / dev/ sdb, new disk is / dev/ sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev/ sdc1 0 & lt; disk size in MBgt; # works on ext2,3, fat16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev/ sadc1 #resize_reiserfs in case
Open Source standards have the huge advantage of having an open specification. Even if one day in the future there'll be no software to read it anymore, one can recreate such software, a task becoming simpler every year.
GIF is a proprietary. patented format and slowly disappearing from the market. Do n't use it.
PNG has been invented as a Open Source standard to replace GIF, but it does much more. It is lossless, supports XMP, EXIF and IPTC metadata, 16 bit color encoding and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms. Its drawback are a relatively big footprints (but smaller than TIFF) and slow compression. We recommend it.
TIFF has been widely accepted as an image format. TIFF can exist in uncompressed form or in a container using a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). It maintains high image quality but at the expense of much larger file sizes. Some cameras let you save your images in this format. The problem is that the format has been altered by so many people that there are now 50 or more flavors and not all are recognizable by all applications.
DNG Digital Negative file format is a royalty free and open RAW image format designed by Adobe Systems. DNG was a response to demand for a unifying camera raw file format. It is based on the TIFF/ EP format, and mandates use of metadata. A handful of camera manufacturers have adopted DNG already, let's hope that the main contenders Canon and Nikon will use it one day.
That's probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, that Adobe introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource blockquot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. It is a labeling technology that lets users embed data about a file in the file itself, the file info is saved using the extensionquot;. xmpquot; (signifying the use of XML/ RDF).
Many photographers prefer keeping an original of their shots (mostly RAW) for the archive. XMP suits that approach as it keeps metadata separate from the image file. I do not share this point of view. There could be problems linking metadata file and image file, and as said above, RAW formats will become obsolete. I recommend using DNG as a container and putting everything inside.
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization engaged in the development of interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI Communities and DCMI Task Groups, annual conferences and workshops, standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.
import images from camera, card reader or scanner. As long as the images are stored on the camera media, you can use that as temporary backup.
RAW are converted to DNG and stored away into an RAW archive (not yet implemented)
For layered editing use external applications. Back in & digikam;, re-apply the metadata, which was probably lost or curtailed by the other applications.
protect processed images for copyrights with Digital Watermarking. Export to web galleries, slide shows, MPEG encode, contact sheets, printing & etc;
The Camera Interface is not the only way to get your photographs into & digikam;. See the Adding a photograph to an Album section for a description of how to add photographs that are already on your hard disk. But Camera Interface provides a lots of advanced settings to import images into your albums database.
To be able to use your digital camera with & digikam;, connect the camera to your computer, switch the camera to the image display mode and turn it on. See you camera's user manual if you need more information.
When you start the Camera Interface, it will try to connect to the Camera. For some cameras this connection phase can take a little while. When connected, a Ready indicator will appear on the bottom and thumbnails of any photographs on the camera will be displayed. Some cameras cannot provide thumbnails of the photographs. If this is the case, you will only see the filenames and a mime-type icon for each item stored by your camera (photograph, movies, sounds, etc).
Before downloading photographs to your computer, you may wish to see camera item information. Using the Properties and Metadata side bar tabs from Camera Interface will launch camera item properties and metadata information.
The Properties tab displays file information recorded by the camera and a resume of photographer information to describe how the image has been taken. A flag indicates if the image has not yet been downloaded to the computer. Note, all this information may be unavailable with some digital cameras.
The Metadata tab displays an internal picture's metadata like EXIF, Makernotes, GPS, & etc;. This information is the same as sidebar Meta-Data from the & digikam; main interface or image editor. Note, all these metadata can be unavailable with some digital cameras.
The simplest way to download photographs from your camera to your computer is to click the Download button and then click Download All. This will download all of the photographs on the camera to a single Album in & digikam;. The download process will not remove the photographs from the camera. It is always advisable to check that the photographs have downloaded safely into the Album you were expecting before deleting them from the camera.
If you do not want to download all of the photographs you can select just those that you need using the standard & kde; selection methods. Once you have the photographs selected, click Download and then Download Selected. The Download Selected button will be grayed out until you have selected some photographs.
If supported by your camera an option Download new is available. Those are images not yet downloaded by & digikam;. In that case the new images are already marked with a star in the thumbnail window. Obviously if you choose this handy option, it will download the new images only.
Using Download All or Download Selected buttons will bring up a dialog, that allows you to select a target Album into which the photographs will be downloaded. The list of existing Albums is displayed, ordered by the Folder method (see the Albums View for details of Album ordering). You can select the target Album from this list and then click OK.
When you have selected the target Album, click OK and & digikam; will download the photographs from the camera to that album.
Once you are happy with the downloaded photographs that you wanted, you are ready to delete photographs from the Camera. You can delete all of the photographs at once by clicking the Delete Delete All button. If you just want to delete a selection of the photographs, you have to select those that you want to delete and click Delete Delete Selected
Please note that there is no way to restore a photo that you have deleted from the camera. The photographs are not moved to the & kde; Trash Can, they are removed completely. It is best to double check that you have successfully downloaded a photograph into a & digikam; Album before you delete it from the camera. Anyway, if you plan to empty the camera card, you better do that from the camera menu because it is much quicker.
Cameras often do not use very meaningful filenames for photographs. The filenames are usually reused once the photographs have been deleted from the camera. This can lead to filename clashes if you download photographs from many shootings into the same Album. It can also be useful to include the date and time that an image was taken into the filename.
In the next box you find the options for rotating/ flipping the image and for date based subalbums. If you check the latter option, folder per day will be automatically generated.
The'On the fly operations' open three more options that act on the photos before storing them on disk. The first two relate to the authors data in Default Author Identity settings. If checked, the respective items will be copied into the EXIF tags and IPTC fields. The last option allows a date & time for all downloaded photographs to be set.
If you want another date format then the default date format, you could fill in for example: photo-%Y-%m-%d %H: %M: %S in the prefix edit line (turn off Add Date & Time). For additional customization read the man page of strftime.
When you select Camera filenames, you have the option to change the filenames to lowercase when downloading. Or use uppercase if you prefer.
The new filename that & digikam; will use for the photographs when they are downloaded is shown underneath the name provided by the camera in the thumbnail view. The renaming settings will be remembered the next time you use the camera interface.
& digikam; can use any information about the orientation of the camera at the moment the photograph was taken for automatic rotation of the photograph when it is downloaded. Not all cameras include this information. See the sidebar Meta-Data section for more detail about information that your camera may have embedded in your photographs.
This automatic rotation is switched on by default, and if your camera does not include the information, & digikam; will leave the photograph at its original orientation. If you would like to switch the automatic rotation off, click the Advanced button and deselect the Auto Orient option at the bottom of the window.
If your camera provides information about the date of the photograph's taking, & digikam; can use this to automatically create subalbums in the destination Album when it is downloaded. Subalbums names will be based on image dates. All images which have the same date will be downloaded into the same subalbum. Not all cameras include this information. See the sidebar Meta-Data section for more detail about information your camera may have embedded in your photographs.
This option is switched off by default and in this case & digikam; will download the photographs in the root destination Albums. If you would like to switch on this option click the Advanced button and select the Download photo in automatically option at the bottom of the window.
The simplest way to upload photographs from your computer to your camera is to click the Download button and then click Upload. A standard & kde; file selection dialog will appear to select the files from your computer to copying on your camera. You can select more than one file using the standard & kde; selection methods.
When images selection is done, & digikam; will ask you where you want to upload the files on your camera. A camera folder selection dialog will appear. Just select one folder and press OK to start uploading. No images will be removed from your computer.
GPS (global positioning system) is used as a generic term throughout this document. It just means a location in latitude and longitude global coordinates that can be displayed on a map. The actual technical implementation that provides the data can be the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.
Not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link an image to a precise geographical location. Not everybody uses an airplane to overfly and scan a certain area with automatic GPS data recording. Environmental planners, military, police, construction bureaus, real estate agencies, all will have an immediate application.
But if, after some time, one has forgotten where the image was taken, if one loves the nice feature to open with a simple click a browser displaying a zoom of the area, if you like to send your image as a postcard to another & digikam; user (who is then able to locate your shot), or if you simply need the documentation aspect of it - having position data stored in a photo is great.
Now, how do we get GPS data into the images? exiv2 supports many kinds of the GPS data fields, even bearing, satellite and map references. So the question is really how to get the data into those fields? There are at least three ways to do this: directly with the appropriate hardware, per post-treatment of GPS and image files using the Geolocation (Manual) Kipi-plugin and per'manual 'insertion of known locations.
To our knowledge there is at the time of writing no camera that integrates a GPS unit. But there are a few that combine with GPS receivers, either as a plug-in card or by data transmission through cable or Bluetooth.
Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony
The GPS track download from a device can be managed with the gpsman or gpsbabel. It is important that the downloaded tracks are being stored in gpx format, which is the only one compatible with the Geolocation plugin.
Several programs exist for & Windows; and MacOS that are able to extract and correlate data from images and GPS data tracks. The following site provides the same functionality for & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto
If you happen to know the latitude/ longitude or other data you can use the this script which is a GPS wrapper for Phil Harvey's ExifTool that uses the signed floating number coordinate notation as produced by maps. google.
maps. google. com does not show the street maps of Europe. But there are European sites (. fr. de. es. it. co. uk at least) that show all navigation details in all of Europe.
& digikam; tries to give you as much control over how it works as possible. There are many options that change the behavior of & digikam;. To access these settings select Settings Configure & digikam; from the menubar. The configuration dialog is separated into 15 pages. You can change between these pages by clicking on the icons on the left-hand side of the dialog.
The Click action can be set to Show embedded preview or Start image editor. You herewith define the default behavior of & digikam; when you click on an image item in the main view.
This page contains the default identity and copyright data as shown on the printscreen below. The data will be automatically written into the respective IPTC data fields if so selected during the download from the camera interface. Also, if you call for database synchronisation, this data will be written into the IPTC fields.
Author title (synonymous with By-line title): This field should contain the job title of the photographer. Examples might include titles such as: Staff Photographer, Freelance Photographer, or Independent Commercial Photographer. Since this is a qualifier for the Author field, the Author field must also be filled out.
Credit (synonymous with Provider): Use the credit field to identify who is providing the photograph. This does not necessarily have to be the author. If a photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or the Associated Press, these organizations could be listed here as they are & quot; providingquot; the image for use by others. If the image is a stock photograph, then the group (agency) involved in supplying the image should be listed here.
The IPTC Actions will save the data into the respective IPTC fields, which ensures a permanent metadata storage in the image and not only in & digikam; 's database. Thus, metadata is persistent across applications, and may be exported or imported into & digikam; without loss.
Save image captions as embedded text: this will synchronize the captions that you add to your photographs with those in embedded in the image. This is useful because the captions embedded in the image can be read by other image viewers. Care should be taken if you have images that already have captions embedded in them because these captions will be overwritten by the captions made within & digikam;.
This setup page covers all options of information appearing when the mouse hovers over a file in the main view. According the checked options they will be shown or not.
& digikam; can understand lots of different image file types as well as some video and audio formats. To control which types of files & digikam; will try to display you can add or remove file extensions from these lists. Any files that are in the & digikam; Album folders that do not match these extensions will be ignored by & digikam;.
The default settings can be easily restored by clicking on the update buttons to the right of each category.
The setting of the & digikam; Light Table can be set to default values on this page so that every time you open the Light Table, these settings are activated (if possible, because for images having different sizes the synchronous mode does not work). The & quot; Load full image sizequot; is only recommended for fast maschines, but if you have one, enable this option for better viewing results.
By default the Image Editor will use a black background behind photographs when they are displayed. If you prefer a different background color you can choose one here. You can also turn off the ToolBar when the Image Editor is in full screen mode.
Over and underexposed areas of an image can be indicated by dark and light marker colors that can be defined here. In the editor this viewing mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11 respectively.
Chroma subsampling is the practice of encoding images by implementing more resolution for luminance information than for color information. Please read this Wikipedia article for a full explanation.
With PNG compression option, you can reduce PNG image files size. This operation does not reduce image quality because PNG uses a lossless algorithm. The only effect is that image data needs more time to compress/ decompress. If you have a fast computer you can change this value to use a high compression factor (1: low compression / 9: high compression).
With Compress TIFF option, you can toggle to use Deflate compression algorithm with TIFF image files. This will reduce TIFF image files sizes. It has no image quality effect because Deflate is a lossless algorithm.
With the LossLess JPEG 2000 files option allows for lossless storage, or, if the lossy options is selected, even then the quality for comparative files size is much better than normal JPEG. At the time of writing, metadata is not yet supported, but it is in the'pipeline '.
In the early versions of & digikam; the Image Editor was just a viewer for photographs, but it is rapidly developing into a very useful photo manipulation tool. This dialog allows you to control how the Image Editor will behave.
The default is to assume that all green pixels are the same. If even-row green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultraviolet light than odd-row this difference causes a mesh pattern in the output; using this option solves this problem with minimal loss of detail. To resume, this option blurs the image a little, but it eliminates false 2x2 mesh patterns with VNG quality method or mazes with AHD quality method.
Use the camera's custom white-balance settings if set. Otherwise apply Automatic color balance if this option is set.
Only used if camera white balance is not set. The default is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card photographed in sunlight.
For Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras only. Use the secondary sensors, in effect underexposing the image by four stops to reveal detail in the highlights. For all other camera types this option is being ignored.
Default is here to consider highlights (read: part of your images that are burned due to the inability of your camera to capture the highlights) as plain / solid white (solid white option). You can get some fancy results with the unclip option which will paint the highlights in various pinks. At last you can try to consider recovering some parts of the missing information from the highlights (reconstruct option).
This is possible because the blue pixels tends to saturate less quickly than the greens and the reds. & digikam; /dcraw will try to reconstruct the missing green and red colors from the remaining none saturated blue pixels. Of course here everything is a question of tradeoff between how much color or white you want.
If you select reconstruct as the option, you will be given the choice to set a level. A value of 3 is a compromise and can/ should be adapted on a per image basis.
Set the luminosity to your taste, you probably need to go a little higher than the default = 1. But this can be adjusted later with the image options in the & digikam; image editor. Given the cost in time for demosaicing, stay conservative.
A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process used to interpolate a complete image from the partial raw data received from the color-filtered image sensor internal to many digital cameras in form of a matrix of colored pixels. Also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction.
& digikam; and Dcraw offer us three alternatives: bi-linear, VNG interpolation, AHD interpolation. It seems that AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) is the best choice for quality according to some test that I have performed and the paper of the person that implemented it. VNG interpolation (Variable Number of Gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw but suffers from color artifacts on the edge. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for speed with a acceptable result.
If you know the CA of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. This is certainly the optimal method for CA correction as it is done during RAW conversion.
Basically, a profile "maps" the color information and gives information on how one should render them. It gives also information to LCMS and & digikam; on how to translate the color information from one color space to an other in order to keep the colors as accurate as possible across all rendring media.
Behavior Ask when opening an image in image editor / Launch Color Management tool with RAW files
Color Profiles Directory Set this to the folder where you store all your profiles & eg; "/ usr/ share/ color/ icc" or "/ home/ user/. color/ icc". & digikam; will scan this folder when starting up.
ICC Profiles Settings Here you are given the ability to provide & quot; defaultquot; choices for your profiles. Everything is adaptable later-on at the opening of a RAW file.
The Use color managed view is an alternative to using Xcalib or Argyll. Only your image will be color managed, not your entire screen!
The input profile should match the camera maker and model you are using. 'Not all profiles are created equal ', there are some that have no tone mapping/ gamma correction included (Canon). As of now, dcraw does not correct gamma for 16 bit depth conversion, which means that you have to do the tone mapping yourself.
There are some other options such as the soft proof profile which enables you to emulate, granted that you have a profile for it, how your image will render for a particular device. It is useful before printing for instance because your printer has a smaller gamut than your camera and some colors might look saturated. You may want to fix this manually instead of relying on the "blind" algorithm of your printer.
For most cameras it is pretty obvious what color profile they propose for the type at hand, not so for the Canon's. Here is a table of camera/ profiles matches, it is non-authoritative of course:
The Canon profile extension betray the target style: F for Faithful Style, L for Landscape Style, N for Neutral Style, P for Portrait Style, S for Standard Style.
Kipi is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. It is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer/ editor applications. By providing this interface, & digikam; can take advantage of many plugins that are written to work with any application that implements the Kipi interface.
If your operating system has the Kipi plugins package installed, you will see a list of available plugins. Select those that you want to use and they will be loaded into & digikam;. The plugins will appear as new menu entries in the main menu bar and in the context menu for thumbnails.
Keyboard shortcuts to actions that plugins perform can be set up in the Setting Configure Shortcuts menu.
For more information about Kipi plugins, you can consult the Kipi project at http: / /www. kipi-plugins. org or the Kipi-plugins manual.
The slide show setup should be easy to understand. The upper slider adjusts the time between image transitions; usually a time of 4-5 seconds is good. The other check boxes enable/ disable the metadata to be shown on the bottom of the slide show images during display.
The camera settings shows on the left of the list of the currently supported cameras. On the right at the top there is an auto-detect button, which tries to identify the camera connected to your computer (make sure that the camera is connected properly to the computer and turned on in the image display mode). Below this are the port settings; the currently supported are Serial, USB, and USB/ FireWire Mass Storage.
At the very bottom is where you set the path for a USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-link) Mass Storage camera. This box becomes active once you select USB or FireWire Mass Storage camera in the camera list. You need to enter here the path where you mount the camera, usually "/ mnt/ camera" or "/ mnt/ removable".
To be able to use your digital camera with & digikam;, connect the camera to your computer, switch the camera to the image display mode and turn it on.
Try and see if & digikam; can auto-detect the camera; if not, you can set the camera model and port manually. Once you have the camera setup, go to the "Cameras" menu in the main interface and you will see the camera listed in the menu.
You can choose any title you like for the camera in the setup and this title will be used in the main window Cameras menu. If you have more than one camera, you can add them through this setup interface.
With the Confirm when moving items to trash setting you can set the verbosity of & digikam; when you delete a photograph or an Album. See Deleting a Photograph and Deleting an Album sections for more details.
The editorial changes done through the right sidebar can be quietly applied by & digikam; when setting the Apply changes in the right sidebar without confirmation option. Otherwise the changes must be applied by pressing the Apply changes button.
You can also switch off the display of the splash screen when & digikam; loads. This may speed up the start time of & digikam; slightly.
Scan for new items at startup option will force & digikam; to scan the album library tree for new items added or removed between & digikam; sessions. This may slow down the start time of & digikam;. If any items have been removed from album library, & digikam; will ask you confirmation before to remove definitely item references in database.
Color schemes are supplied like themes to personalize & digikam; main interface for you pleasure. To access these settings select Settings Themes from the menubar and select your preferred theme to use. A preview of the available themes is listed below:
Theme settings are implemented in simple text file. If you are interested to create a new theme for & digikam;, you can find more information about it in this tutorial.
& digikam; incorporates a fast Image Editor with a few basic yet powerful image editing tools. You can use the Image Editor to view your photographs and to make corrections and alterations. The Image Editor can be accessed either by clicking on a thumbnail in the Image Window or by right-clicking on a thumbnail and selecting Edit from the context menu.
The Image Editor provides a number of tools that enable you to adjust a photograph. Some of these tools are provided by plugins to & digikam;. So they may not be available by default on your distribution. See the Setup Image Editor Section for more details about Kipi-plugins.
A status at the bottom which shows the filename, the current file number, the current zoom level, and the current image size.
A menu bar across the top and below that a tool bar that provides quick access to some commonly used functions.
The editing functions of the Image Editor will make changes to your photograph. None of the editing functions will change the original photograph unless you select File Save or click the Save button in the tool bar. Note that once you have saved the changed version you will not be able to recover the original photograph.
You might prefer to take a copy of your photograph before you make any changes. You can use File Save As to save a working copy.
At any time before you save your photograph you can restore the view to the original image by selecting File Revert or clicking the The Image Editor Revert Button Revert button on the tool bar. You will lose any changes that you have made to the photograph since it was last saved.
Almost anything you do to an image in Image Editor can be undone/ redone. You can undo the most recent action by choosing Edit Undo, and redo by Edit Redo
If these are done frequently, you really should memorize the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo an action, and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to redo an action.
You have to press the & LMB; over the undo or redo icon in the tool bar and hold it down for a moment to produce a context menu. If you choose one of the menu items, all undo/ redo actions until the chosen ones are undone/ redone.
Once you have started the Image Editor you can move between photographs in the same view you started from by using the navigator buttons on the toolbar, PgUp, PgDown or the entries in the File menu. If you have made any changes to the current photograph you will be asked if you want to save them.
You can zoom in and out of a photograph using the Ctrl; scroll wheel, the toolbar icons or the entries in the View menu.
To make a photograph fit the window use this button on the tool bar: Zoom Autofit
View Full Screen Mode will display the photograph using the full screen mode. You can move back to the normal view by pressing the Esc; key. By default the toolbar is still displayed even in Full Screen Mode. If you would prefer that the toolbar is not displayed you can turn it off in the Configure & digikam; dialog accessed from the main & digikam; window, see the Setup Image Editor Section.
When you want to print the current image from the Image Editor, select File Print image (Ctrl; +P) and you get the standard & kde; Print dialog, where you can adjust the settings before printing your photograph.
From the main window view you can print single images or whole sets of them. Entire thumbnail pages can be printed with your selection. All you need to do is selecting images the standard way and call Image Print Assistant. Then follow the instructions and choices to make.
The & digikam; main window has a sidebar at the right border providing important information and actions of the selected images. This same sidebar is also available in the Image Editor view. It can be displayed by respectively clicking on one of the five tabs:
Clicking successively onto the same tab will make the sidebar pop up or fold back into the border.
The caption view can be used to type or paste in a caption of unlimited size (see note below). The text is UTF-8 compatible, meaning that all special characters are allowed. The captions are copied to EXIF and IPTC fields to be used by other applications.
IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters (old American norm). All texts will be truncated after 2000 chars, and special characters will be malformed. If you intend to use the IPTC caption field in other applications you should be compliant with these restrictions.
After commenting, either choose the Apply button or go straight to the next image, the captions will be saved.
Next to the Apply button there is the More button. From it you can either choose to read metadata from the selected file to the database, or the other way around, to write metadata to the files (the latter take place anyway if you chose a metadata setting so that all metadata is always saved to the images).
The Rating section displays a 0... 5 star rating scheme that can be used in searches and sort orders. It can be applied by a single mouse click to the 5 stars in the sidebar or with a keyboard short-cut Ctrl+0... 5. The rating from the sidebar is always applied to one image at a time. To rate a number of images, select them and pop-up the context menu (right-click) to apply a common rating.
The rating is then transcribed into the IPTC'urgency 'data field. The transcoding follows the scheme in this table:
The tag view shows an adaptive filter tag search box, the tag tree and a combo-box containing the tags previously applied in this & digikam; session.
The tag tree will be adapted dynamically as a function of the search word as you type into the box. So it is easy to quickly reduce the number of possibilities when searching for a tag. Of course, this feature is only useful if you have many tags.
The combo-box at the bottom is another ergonomic feature for easy tagging of an image series. As you apply different tags they will be memorized in this box for quick access.
Otherwise tags are simply applied by checking the respective boxes in the tree. All tags of an image are transcribed into the IPTC'keyword 'data field.
In case you have selected a number of images in the main view and you check a tag in the tag tree, this one is only applied to the highlighted image, and not to the whole selection. If you want to tag selections, refer to the Tag filters section.
The tag filter sidebar is used to modify the set of images displayed in the main window view. Normally one uses the left sidebar with its Album, Date, Tags and Searches view. When additionally one or more tags on right sidebar tag filter is checked, only the cross-section of these two selections will be displayed. All created tags are available.
Another use is drag-and-drop tagging. Lets say you selected in the main view a number of images to tag them. If the tag already exists, simply drag it from the right sidebar onto the selection (any one of the highlighted images). A dialog will pop-up and ask if this tag should be applied.
In the above example the main window shows the images from a calender date, the tag filter is set to'not tagged ', which reduces the set to 3 images. They have been selected with Ctrl+a, then a tag is dragged from the right tag tree over the selection and dropped. A pop-up dialog asks if the tag shall be applied.
This parsing for modifications happens at every application start-up, but it can be disabled in the Settings under Miscellaneous
If you made a rule with As well as and you realize that it should have been Or, you can easily switch to that by double clicking on the text As well as in the rules area.
the item used to search in the database, which can be an album, a name, a tag, an image, a keyword, & etc;.
the operator argument which can be a string or a name already set by database.
For instance, you can set an advanced query to search all items in the database using these options:
If you want to group options together, just check the option box at the end of the rule and press Group button. Options will be appear in the list like this:
Why did n't I mention Picasaweb or Flickr (to name the competition)? Because the free space is limited there to 1 GB and you do n't want to have full resolution images online.
This article/ tutorial has mainly been authored by Elle Stone, thanks Elle for that contribution. I merely adapted it to & digikam; 's concrete implementation.
The point of a color-managed workflow is to ensure that the colors coming from your camera or scanner have a predictable relationship with the colors you actually photographed or scanned, that the colors displayed on your monitor match the colors coming from your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or display on the web match the colors you produced in your digital darkroom.
When it comes to color management, everyone wants to know, "which buttons do I push to get the results I want". Unfortunately, color management of necessity involves making informed choices at every step along the image-processing workflow. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide sufficient background information on color management, along with links to more in-depth information, to enable you to begin to make your own informed decisions, based on your own desired results.
If your imaging workflow meets all six criteria listed below, then you do n't need to worry about color management.
you are working at a monitor properly calibrated to the sRGB color space (more about that below)
your only other image output is via email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard
So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why use any other color space and thus be forced to worry about color management issues?
A visual representation of the limitations of sRGB compared to the colors we actually see in the real world is presented here after. It shows a two-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see (the horseshoe-shaped region) and the colors contained in the sRGB space (the smaller triangular region).
If you would like to see a two-dimensional representation of sRGB compared to some of the larger working color spaces, see Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site, click on "Info" then on "Information About RGB Working Spaces".
If I choose to work exclusively in the sRGB color space, do I need to calibrate my monitor?
Yes! Whether you stay within the color gamut provided by sRGB or not, you need a properly calibrated monitor because sRGB assumes that your monitor is calibrated to sRGB. Your monitor calibration closes the loop. If you work within the color gamut provided by sRGB then you need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard (or produce and use an accurate monitor profile, or both).

This tool set provides five automatic correction levels that will improve an image in most cases. Use this tool before going into the more involved manual adjustments.
The Normalize, Equalize, Auto Levels, and Stretch Contrast available from Correct Auto-Correction menu entry menu will attempt to work out the best color levels automatically. You will need to experiment with the effects of these functions to see what works best with your photograph.
Normalize: this method scales brightness values across the selected image so that the darkest point becomes black, and the brightest point becomes as bright as possible without altering its hue. This is often a "magic fix" for images that are dim or washed out.
Equalize: this method adjusts the brightness of colors across the selected image so that the histogram for the Value channel is as flat as possible, that is, so that each possible brightness value appears at about the same number of pixels as each other value. Sometimes Equalize works wonderfully at enhancing the contrasts of an image. Other times it gives garbage. It is a very powerful operation, which can either work miracles on an image or destroy it.
Auto-levels: this method maximizes the tonal range in the Red, Green, and Blue channels. It determines the image shadow and highlight limit values and adjust the Red, Green, and Blue channels to a full histogram range.
Stretch Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by stretching the lowest and highest values to their fullest range, adjusting everything in between. This is noticeable only with washed-out images and can be a good fix-it tool for bad photographs.
The & digikam; White Balance is a semi-automatic tool to adjust the white-balance of a photograph.
The whitebalance correction is somewhat limited by the fact that we operate in 8bit per channel color space. So if you depart too much from the original, over exposure zones may appear. If you can adjust the whitebalance in raw conversion mode (which is done in 16 bit space), the margin for correction will be greater.
This tool is based on a white color balance algorithm copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. Launch it from the Color White Balance Image Editor menu.
The preview window can be resized. To the left, both an original and a target preview tab is shown. The target preview is updated dynamically according to the tool's settings. If you want to see the original whitebalance, just click on that tab.
The target photo preview has a red marker available. The luminosity value of the pixel under the marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.
To the top right, the widget displays a histogram that is dynamically updated when changing the parameters. This histogram is very instructive as it shows that even in well exposed photos, most of the pixels have very small luminosity. With a button you can select to show either one of the 3 colors (or the sum of it which is called luminosity).
The contrast of your output depends on Shadows, Saturation, and Gamma parameters. The Shadows adjustment lets you enhance or diminish the shadow details in your photo.
Instead of fiddling around with the above controls, you can simply use the Temperature Tone Color Picker button. Press on this button and click anywhere on the original preview image to get the output color of that area to calculate the white color balance temperature settings. This way, Temperature and Green values are automatically computed.
In addition you can set the White Balance using the preset list. These are the white color balance temperature presets available:
Over Exposure Indicator option adds up the colors if more than one channel in a pixel is over-exposed, and you will see the combined color resulting of White Color Balance controls settings. This rule is applied to target preview area as an indication only and has no effect on the final rendering.
Save As and Load buttons are used to do just that. Any White Color Balance settings that you have set can be saved to the filesystem in a text file and loaded later.
Reset All button resets all filter settings to default values corresponding to Neutral White Balance color. (Attention, even the neutral setting might be different from your original photograph. If you save it, the white balance will be changed.)
Here you can change the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8 bit encoding is the common JPEG format, 16 bit encoding is better suited for high quality images, but this format needs more storage space, calculation time and is currently available with PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG formats only.
This tool opens the same dialog as when editing RAW images. Its use is the change and assignment of color profiles. Tone mapping can also be done from the lightness adjustment tab (bottom tab). For detailed instructions on the use of color profiles, please refer to CM chapter.
Another important tool is called Color Levels Adjust. This tool provides an integrated way of seeing the results of adjusting multiple levels and also enables you to save level settings for application to multiple photographs. This can be useful if your camera or scanner often makes the same mistakes and you want to apply the same corrections. See the dedicated Adjust Levels manual for more information.
A very powerful way of correcting exposure problems is to use the Adjust Curves tool available by Color Curves Adjust menu entry.
The & digikam; Color Effects tool provides four color effects: a solarization effect, a velvia filter, neon effect and edge filter.
In the age of chemical image processing, solarizing (also known as Sabatier) was an effect created by exposing a partially developed print to a brief flash of light, then completing the development. The colored, darker areas shield the additional light from the sensitive photo layers, which has the net effect of making the lighter areas darker and colors being inverted during the second exposure. The result resembles a partially negative image. The tool allows to adjust the interesting effect smoothly.
The Intensity control helps to preview the solarization by simply increasing it. At about 50% intensity the image shows what was once chemically possible. If you further increase the effect it will finally become a negative image, a stage of inversion not achievable on photographic paper.
This is an example of solarization effect. The original image is (1) and the corrected image is (2). The Intensity level applied is 30%.
The vivid filter simulates what is known as & quot; Velviaquot; effect. It is different from saturation in that it has a more pronounced contrast effect that bring colors brilliantly alive and glowing. Try it, it renders beautiful for many subjects!
Velvia is a brand of daylight-balanced color reversal film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. The name is a contraction of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot;, a reference to its smooth image structure. Velvia has very saturated colors under daylight, high contrast. These characteristics make it the slide film of choice for most nature photographers. Velvia's highly saturated colors are, however, considered overdone by some photographers, especially those who do n't primarily shoot landscapes.
The neon filter simulates neon light along the contrast edges. The level parameter controls the lightness of the result, whereas the interaction slider determines the thickness of the neon light. With big images, the filter might eat the CPU time for a moment.
Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual to want to correct the color contrast and brightness of a photograph. You can experiment with altering the levels of different aspects of your photographs using the tools under the Color menu. You can see any adjustments you make reflected in the preview. When you are happy with the results, press Ok and they will take effect.
When you take images in low light conditions, you could get the opposite problem: too much saturation. In this case the Hue/ Saturation tool is again a good one to use, only by reducing the saturation instead of increasing it. You can see any adjustments you make reflected in the preview image. When you are happy with the results, press Ok and they will take effect.
Situated between the more sophisticated Adjust Curves tool and the simpler Brightness/ Contrast/ Gamma Image Editor tool is this Adjust Levels tool for improving exposure. Although the dialog for this tool looks very complicated, for the basic usage we have in mind here, the only part you need to deal with is the Input Levels area, concretely the 3 sliders that appear below the histogram.
This widget contains a visual graph of the intensity values of the active layer or selection (histogram). Below the graph are five sliders that can be clicked into and dragged to constrain and change the intensity level for the image. The left sliders position represents the dark areas and similarly, the right position represents the light areas.
Actually the easiest way to learn how to use it is to experiment by moving the three sliders around, and watching how the image is affected.
On the right, both an original and a target preview image is available. The target preview is updated dynamically according to the slider positions. On the left, the following options are available:
Set Scale for channel: this combo controls whether the histogram will be displayed using a linear or logarithmic amplitude. For images taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is usually the most useful. However, for images that contain substantial areas of constant color a linear histogram will often be dominated by a single bar. In this case a logarithmic histogram will often be more useful.
Three sliders: the first on the top for dark tones, the second one for light tones, and the last one on the bottom for midtones (often called Gamma value).
Three Color Picker buttons using the original photo preview to automatically adjust inputs levels settings for shadow, midtone and highlights. There is also a fully automated adjustment button available next to the reset button.
Output Levels: the output levels allow manual selection of a narrowed-down output level range. There are also two sliders located here that can be used to interactively change the output levels like Input Levels. This output level compression may, for example, be used to create a bleached image as a background for some other subject to put into the foreground.
Auto: this button performs an automatic setting of the levels based on the pixel intensities of the image.
Save As and Load: these buttons are used to do just that. Any Levels that you have set can be saved to the filesystem and loaded later. The used file format is The Gimp Levels format.
Using in this mode and the three Color Picker buttons will automatically adjust input levels settings in all channels for shadow, middle, and highlight tones. Enable the color picker button that you want use, and click on the original image preview area to set input levels on each of the Red, Green, Blue, and Luminosity histogram channels.
Over Exposure Indicator option checks all color channel to see if more than one channel in a pixel is over-exposed, and you will see the combined color resulting of channel level settings. This feature is available as an indicator in the target preview area and has no effect on final rendering.
Below, you can see an Input levels adjustment example applied to a color image for the Red/ Green/ Blue channels. Intensity/ Alpha channels and Output Levels are unchanged. The original image is (1), the corrected image (2).
To the left, half of the original and the target preview image is shown. The target preview is updated dynamically according to the widget settings. On the right side the following options are available:
Modify Channel: with this combo box you can select the specific channel to be modified by the tool:
Next to this box are two icons to select linear or logarithmic histogram display. For images taken with a digital camera the linear mode is usually the most useful. However, for images containing substantial areas of constant color, a linear histogram will often be dominated by a single bar. In this case a logarithmic histogram will be more appropriate.
If, for example, you move a curve segment to the right, i. e. to highlights, you can see that these highlights are corresponding to darker output tones and that image pixels corresponding to this curve segment will go darker.
The original photo preview has a red marker on it. If you place this marker to a zone you want to modify, a corresponding line will be drawn on the curve grid indicating the original value. Create a point on that line and move it up or down to adjust it to your pleasing.
Save As and Load: these buttons are used to do just that. Any curves that you have set can be saved to the filesystem and loaded later. The used file format is The Gimp Curves format.
Using this way and the three Color Picker buttons will automatically create control points on the curve in all channels for shadow, middle, and highlight tones. Enable the color picker button that you want to use, and click on the original image preview area to produce control points on each of the Red, Green, Blue, and Luminosity control curves.
Over Exposure Indicator option adds up all color channels and indicates the blown-out highlights. If more than one channel in a pixel is over-exposed you will see the combined color resulting from the curve settings. The display is an indicator only and has no effect on the final rendering.
Below you can see a black and white photograph corrected in Luminosity channel. Shadow and highlight tone picker tool have been use to determined the curves to apply from original. The original image is (1), the corrected image (2).
The & digikam; image Channel Mixer is a tool to remix the color channels to improve or modify the photograph color shades.
The Channel Mixer is an another sophisticated tool to refine the images' tonality. Start it from the Color Channel Mixer Image Editor menu.
With the channel combo box you select and display the histogram per color. It gives a first hint of how to correct the channels by their relative distribution and amplitude. The left half of the dialog window always shows a preview of what you are doing. The original for comparison can be seen when selecting its own window tab.
The target photo preview has a red marker available. If you place this marker somewhere in the image, a corresponding vertical bar will be drawn in the histogram indicating the color level value in the current channel selected.
Now the controls are to the lower right: Red, Green and Blue slider controls enable you to mix the channels. If you check Preserve Luminosity the image will retain its overall luminosity despite you changing its color components. This feature is particularly useful when you also ticked the Monochrome box. Because the channel mixer is THE tool to make great black and white conversions of your photographs. Try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.
Sometimes, especially when doing monochrome mixing, reducing one color channel may increase visible noise, which actually originates in the chroma noise. Chroma noise means that the little noise specs do not appear at the same location in all the color channels, but the noise patterns looks different in every channel. If that is the case you can improve the monochrome conversion by reducing the chroma noise first.
Save As and Load buttons are used to do just that. Any mixer settings that you have set can be saved to the filesystem and loaded later. The used file format is The Gimp channel mixer format.
Over Exposure Indicator option adds up the colors if more than one channel in a pixel is over-exposed, and you will see the combined color resulting of channel gain settings. This rule is applying to target preview area and have n't effect to final rendering.
Below, you can see a photograph color tone adjustments for the Blue channel. Preserve luminosity option is on. The original image is (1), the corrected image (2).
Black & White photography has always been fascinating in its abstraction capability. With the advent of digital photography, Bamp; W has almost become a desktop activity, as color images can be easily converted on the computer into black and white, even providing a set of vintage film roll profiles.

Green Filter: simulates black & white film exposure with green lens filter. This comes good with all scenic images, especially suited for portraits taken against the sky (similar to 004 Cokin(tm) Green filter).
Orange Filter: simulates black & white film exposure with an orange lens filter. This will enhance landscapes, marine scenes and aerial photography (similar to 002 Cokin(tm) Orange filter).
Red Filter: simulates black & white film exposure with red lens filter. Creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate moonlight scenes in daytime (similar to 003 Cokin(tm) Red filter).
Yellow Filter: simulates black & white film exposure with yellow lens filter. Most natural tonal correction, improves contrast. Ideal for landscapes (similar to 001 Cokin(tm) Yellow filter).
Sepia Tone: gives a warm highlight and mid-tone while adding a bit of coolness to the shadows - very similar to the process of bleaching a print and re-developing in a sepia toner (typical for your grandmothers photographs). Similar to 005 Cokin(tm) Sepia filter.
The & digikam; Apply Texture is a tool for applying decorative textures to an image.
By adding texture to your image, whether color or black and white, you can make it look like an oil painting on canvas, an Old Masters etching, a Pop Art portrait composed of enlarged half-tone dots, or even a mural on a brick wall. The Image Apply Texture Image Editor menu can be used for that.
Relief: dragging this option to the right increases the appearance of depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on image.
A Paper texture effect apply to a photograph is available below. The original image is (1), the target image is (2). Relief factor used is 200.
The & digikam; Add Border is a tool to frame an image with decorative borders.
Keeping the viewer's interest within the confines of the edges of a photograph is not a simple task. One of the simplest ways to hold the attention on an image is to incorporate a decorative frame around an image. It acts as a kind of psychological barrier to the straying eye. The Image Add Border Image Editor menu can be used for that.
Type: this option specifies the decorative frame style to apply around the image. Solid style just surrounds the image with a colored line, Niepce style surrounds the image with a fine line and a large border (ideal for black and white images), Beveled style adds a neat dimension to your image (ideal to create a button effect), and Decorative style adds an ornamental border using patterns.
Width: this option specifies the border width in percents of image size. The border is added around the image. The width range is limited between 1% and 50%.
The border decorated target image will be bigger than the original, but it will retain the same aspect ratio. This is important for printing images, especially if you have used the Aspect Ratio Crop tool before.
This is a handy tool as it lets you add formatted text easily to an image wherever you want, at several places when needed.
This tool seems very intuitive to use. Type in your text and place it with the mouse. Use the block settings as you please. Choose the orientation, color from a color space, and fonts with all their properties. You will have to scale the font size to the image size, the larger the image, the larger the font has to be! Finally choose to add a border around the text and/ or a semitransparent background. Voilà, it's finished!
Any text setting you have chosen can always be changed as long as you do n't click the OK button. In saved and reloaded images the text has become part of the image, it cannot be changed anymore.
The & digikam; Template Superimpose is a masking tool to superimpose templates to an image.
The Image Template Superimpose Image Editor menu is used to apply templates to an image.
There is no restriction on template size and orientation, but you must use PNG file format with max. compression (9) to reduce the template file size. If you want to add your template creation to the & digikam; templates database, please send a mail to this & digikam; mailing-list digikam-users@kde. org.
If you are using the tool for the first time, you must set your local templates directory using the Root Directory button in the dialog. Select the folder where you have copied the template files. The widget remembers this setting at the next instance.
When the root template directory is set, a folder tree view is created which displays the template directories structure. Selecting one will update the templates preview bar automatically.
Below the preview area, three buttons give you control over the template zoom and position on your image:
Zoom In: this button increases the underlying image's zoom factor. The image is centered to the current mouse position. Validate with the left mouse button.
Zoom Out: this button decreases the zoom factor. The image is centered to the current mouse position. If you want to apply the template to the full image you have to zoom out fully. Validate with the left mouse button.
Move: use this button to pan the underlying image. Click and drag the image with the right mouse button.
Click on the OK button to apply the template to the current image, which in turn will be automatically resized to the preview size.
& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening, with each having merits in a different area.
Sharpen is a traditional sharpening tool, which is very fast and easy, but may quickly produce grainy images, in particular in dark areas.
Unsharp Mask works on the edge contrast to make an image appear sharper, but it actually does not sharpen at all, it works rather psychovisually. It can be used to remove atmospheric haze, and here it does a real good job. The algorithm was taken from the Gimp, and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.
Refocus is probably the best of the three because it actually improves sharpness. It is a bit more involved in its application as is has several parameters to play with.
Out-of-focus photographs, as well as most digitized images, need correction of sharpness. This is due to the digitizing process that must chop up a color continuum in points with slightly different colors: elements thinner than sampling frequency will be averaged into an uniform color. Thus, sharp borders are rendered a little blurred. The same phenomenon appears when printing color dots on paper. SLR cameras need even more sharpening on a regular basis than consumer cameras.
Whereas JPEG images have some camera-internal sharpening applied, RAW format images always need sharpening in their workflow.
Some scanners apply a sharpen filter while scanning. It's worth to disable it so that you keep control over your image.
In some situations, you may be able to get useful results by sharpening an photograph using the Sharpen tool by the Enhance Sharpen menu entry.
You should be careful with this though, or the results will not look very natural: sharpening increases the apparent sharpness of edges in the photograph, but also amplifies noise. Generally, the most useful technique for sharpening a fuzzy photograph is the Refocus tool. You can access it with the Enhance Refocus menu entry. Look at Refocus for more information and a comparison of all the sharpening techniques.
Sometimes you have the opposite problem: an image is too crisp. The solution is to blur it a bit: fortunately blurring an image is much easier than sharpening it. Select the Blur Tool with the Enhance Blur menu entry and experiment with the level. The preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of the operation on your photograph.
The Unsharp Mask filter is an excellent tool to remove haze from your photographs, see this url for a demonstration.
The image panel and the original preview help you to pan within the image. The preview window shows the filter output using the current settings.
There are two important parameters, Radius and Amount. The default values often work pretty well, so you should try them first. Increasing either the Radius or the Amount increases the strength of the effect. Do n't get carried away, though: if you make the unsharp mask too strong, it will amplify noise in the image and create the impressions of ridges next to sharp edges.
The Radius allows you to set how many pixels on either side of an edge that will be affected by sharpening. High resolution images allow higher radius. You'd better always sharpen an image at its final resolution.
The Amount control is the percentage of the difference between the original and the blur image that is added back into the original. It allows you to set strength of sharpening.
The Threshold control is a fraction of the maximum RGB value, needed to apply the difference amount. It allows you to set the minimum difference in pixel values that indicates an edge where sharpening should be applied. That way, you can protect areas of smooth tonal transition from sharpening, and avoid creation of blemishes in face, sky or water surface.
This is an example of how the Unsharp Mask can change your life. The original image is (1) and the corrected image is (2). The unsharp mask was applied with Radius = 6.0, Amount = 0.5, Threshold = 0.0.
& digikam; The Refocus is a tool to refocus an image by enhancing the sharpness. It uses the Deconvolution Filter algorithm copyrighted by Ernst Lippe.
This tool attempts to & quot; refocusquot; an image by undoing the defocussing. This is better than just trying to sharpen a photograph. It is employing a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. The traditional technique for sharpening images is to use unsharp masking. Refocus generally produces better results than Unsharp masking. Start it from the Enhance Sharpen Refocus Image Editor menu.
In practice, in most cases the Circular convolution works much better than the Gaussian convolution. The Gaussian convolution has a very long tail, so mathematically the result of the convolution also depends on source pixels at a large distance from the original source pixel. The FIR Wiener inverse of a Gaussian convolution in most cases is heavily influenced by source pixels at a large distances, and in most cases this produces undesirable results.
Circular Sharpness: This is the radius of the Circular convolution filter. It is the most important parameter for using the plug-in. With most images the default value of 1 should give good results. Select a higher value when your image is very blurred, but beware of producing halos.
Correlation: Increasing the Correlation may help reducing artifacts. The correlation can range from 0-1. Useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. Using a high value for the correlation will reduce the sharpening effect of the plug-in.
Noise filter: Increasing the Noise filter parameter helps reducing artifacts. The Noise can range from 0-1 but values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. When the Noise value is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality will be horrible. A useful value is 0.03. Using a high value for the Noise will even blur the image further.
Gaussian Sharpness: This is the radius for the Gaussian convolution filter. Use this parameter when your blurring is Gaussian (mostly due to previous blur filtering). In most cases you should leave this parameter to 0, because it causes nasty artifacts. When you use non-zero values you will probably have to increase the Correlation and/ or Noise filter parameters, too.
Matrix size: This parameter determines the size of the transformation matrix. Increasing the Matrix Size may give better results, especially when you have chosen large values for Circular Sharpness or Gaussian Sharpness. Note that the plug-in will become very slow when you select large values for this parameter. In most cases you should select a value in the range 3-10.
Save As and Load: these buttons are used to do just that. Any Refocus parameters that you have set can be saved to the filesystem and loaded later.
Preferrably perform all cropping, color and intensity curve corrections on the image before using this plug-in.
Otherwise use this plug-in before performing any other operations on the image. The reason is that many operations on the image will leave boundaries that are not immediately visible but that will leave nasty artifacts.
When you are scanning images and compress them, & eg; to JPEG, you should use the plug-in on the uncompressed image.
In general, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. This is probably caused by the fact that unsharp masking uses a larger neighborhood than sharpening.
From a theoretical point of view unsharp masking must always introduce artifacts. Even under optimal circumstances it can never completely undo the effect of blurring. For Wiener filtering it is possible to prove that it is the optimal linear filter. In practice, in all cases the results of the FIR Wiener filter were at least as good as those of unsharp masking. The FIR Wiener filter is frequently better in restoring small details.
Below, you can see a comparison of different filter apply on a small unfocused image:
Original blurred color image to fix. This image have been taken with an analog still camera. The unfocusing result of an insuffisant light for the auto-focus lens.
For more information about correction of sharpness methods used in digital imagery, you can find a technical comparison at this url.
The Smooth slider sets the blurring of the area that has been darkened to render the pupil more natural
The Color Tint sets a custom colorization for the pupil. If you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, here you can do it
The Photograph Inpainting tool is definitely one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented performance.
The inpainting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS lab in Caen/ France and is a part of the CImg project.
The tool comes with several presets as starting points and to simplify the restoration. The preset settings available are listed below:
If you want to set filter parameters for finer adjustments, use Smoothing Settings and Advanced Settings tabs:
Detail Preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the curvatures (features). A low value forces an equal smoothing across the image, whereas bigger values preferably smooth the homogeneous regions and leaves the details sharper. A value of 0.9 should well preserve details so that no sharpening is required afterwards. Note that Detail Preservation must be always inferior to Anisotropy.
Anisotropy alpha [0, 100]: a low value smooths equally in all directions, whereas a value close to 1 smooths in one direction only. If you have film grain or CCD kind of noise a high value will result in wave-like pattern, whereas JPEG artifacts are suited for values close to 1.
Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum overall smoothing factor (when p defines the relative smoothing). Set it according to the noise level.
Regularity [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned with the bigger structures. The bigger this value, the more even the overall smoothing will be. This is necessary when much noise is present since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry. Also if you want to achieve a'van Gogh 'turbulence effect, setting it higher than 3 is recommended.
Filter Iterations: number of times the blurring algorithm is applied. Usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.
Angular Step da [5, 90]: angular integration of the anisotropy alpha. If alpha is chosen small, da should also be chosen small. But beware, small angles result in long runs! Choose it as large as you can accept.
Integral Step [0.1, 10]: spatial integration step width in terms of pixels. Should remain less than 1 (sub-pixel smoothing) and never be higher than 2.
Use Linear Interpolation: The gain in quality if you select this option is only marginal and you lose a factor of 2 in speed. Our recommendation is to leave it off.
Save As and Load buttons are used to do just that. Any Photograph Inpainting filter settings that you have set can be saved to the filesystem in a text file and loaded later.
Photograph Inpainting is (comparatively) very fast in what it is doing, but it can take a long time to run and cause high CPU load. You may always abort computation by pressing Cancel button during rendering.
Below, you can see a Remove Small Area Inpainting type applied to a color photograph taken at Guatemala city with an analog camera. Look like there is a strange black artifacts on the face front, resulting of a bad film stockage during the travel. The original image is (1), the corrected image (2).
& digikam; The Noise Reduction is a powerful tool to reduce the image noise. It uses an algorithm copyrighted by Peter Heckert.
This tool provides selectable image filters to remove specks or other artifacts caused by junk such as dust or hair on the lens. It also can be used to remove Sensor Noise from the camera that maybe caused by high ISO settings, as well as the so-called Moireacute; Patterns on scanned images from books or magazines.
If you want more information about what's digital camera sensor noise, please take a look in this tutorial.
The above screenshot shows a typical scene taken with an digital camera using a high sensitivity ISO setting. It shows grainy noise which can be reduced successfully with this tool.
You can see below a full description of all parameters. In most cases only Details tab is needed and the other parameters available into Advanced tab can be left at their default setting.
Radius: this control selects the gliding window size used for the filter. Larger values do not increase the amount of time needed to filter each pixel in the image but can cause blurring. This window moves across the image, and the color in it is smoothed to remove imperfections. In any case it must be about the same size as noise granularity or somewhat more. If it is set higher than necessary, then it can cause unwanted blur.
Sharpness: this control set the sharpness level. This value defines the pixel distance in which the filter looks ahead for luminance variations. When this value is increased, then spikenoise is erased. You can eventually readjust filter Edge, when you changed this setting. When this value is to high, then the adaptive filter cannot longer accurately track image details, and noise can reappear or blur can occur.
Edge: this control set the edge accuracy for sharpness. This value improves the frequency response for the filter. When it is too strong then not all noise can be removed, or spike noise may appear. Set it near to maximum, if you want to remove weak noise or JPEG-artifacts, without loosing detail.
Luminance: this control set the luminance tolerance of image. It's recommended to use only Color or Luminance tolerance settings to make an image correction, not the both at the same time. This settings do n't influence the main smoothing process controlled by Details settings.
Color: this control set the color tolerance of image. It's recommended to use only Color or Luminance tolerance settings to make an image correction, not the both at the same time. This settings do n't influence the main smoothing process controlled by Details settings.
Gamma: this control set the gamma tolerance of image. This value can be used to increase the tolerance values for darker areas (which commonly are more noisy). This results in more blur for shadow areas.
Damping: this control set the phase jitter damping adjustment. This value defines how fast the adaptive filter-radius reacts to luminance variations. If increased, then edges appear smoother, if too high, then blur may occur. If at minimum then noise and phase jitter at edges can occur. It can suppress spike noise when increased and this is the preferred method to remove it.
Save As and Load: these buttons are used to do just that. Any Noise Reduction parameters that you have set can be saved to the filesystem and loaded later.
This is an example of how the noise reduction can change your life. The original image is (1) and the corrected image is (2). The noise reduction was applied using default settings.
Sometimes an image is too crisp for your purposes. The solution is to blur it a bit: fortunately blurring an image is much easier than sharpening it. Select the Blur Tool with the Enhance Blur menu entry and experiment with the level. The preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of the operation on your photograph.
& digikam; The Photograph Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photograph artifacts.
This fantastic restoration filter is a new development providing unprecedented possibilities in the public domain to remove lots of unwanted stuff from your images. It is well adapted to deal with degraded images suffering from Gaussian noise, film grain, scratches or compression artifacts and local degradations usually encountered in digital (original or digitized) images. The smoothing happens along the image curvatures, thus preserving the meaningful content much alike our human eye would want it.
The same algorithm can be used for colorization and texture replacement which is covered by another tool (inpainting). The restoration algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS lab in Caen/ France and is a part of the CImg project.
Reduce JPEG Artifacts: JPEG's compression is not perfect, in fact for some types of images it is far from it. As a lossy compression algorithm, there are some compression & quot; artifactsquot; - slight defaults showing in the decompressed image. This setting aims at correcting this problem.
Save As and Load buttons are used to do just that. Any Photograph Restoration filter settings that you have set can be saved to the filesystem in a text file and loaded later.
Photograph restoration is (comparatively) very fast in what it is doing, but it can take a long time to run and cause high CPU load. You may always abort computation by pressing Abort button during preview rendering.
Below, you can see a Reduce Uniform Noise Restoration type applied to a Black and White photograph taken with a Minolta(tm) 700Si camera using Ilford(tm) HP-5 film set at 3200 ISO sensitivity. You see the very prominent film grain on the faces. The original image is (1), the corrected image (2).
Below, you can see an another Photograph Restoration example using Reduce Texturing Restoration type applied to an old color photograph acquire with a digital flat scanner. You see the very prominent artifacts resulting of scanner light on plastic photograph paper. The original image is (1), the corrected image (2).
& digikam; The Hot Pixels tool facilitates removing hot pixels from photographs taken with a CCD camera. It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.
Stuck, dead or hot pixels are a problem in particular when shooting in high quality raw mode since many cameras have built-in hot pixel suppression applied automatically when JPEG compression is used (which is mostly the case).
This tool can be used to fix the & quot; Hot pixelsquot; and & quot; Stuck Pixelsquot; on a photograph using a black frame subtraction method. There is no yet a manual editor to select bad pixels.
Load this file to the widget using the Black Frame button. The toll will process an automatic detection of Hot and Stuck Pixels. They will be highlighted in the control panel preview areas.
If you use an old digital camera, it is important to re-shoot the Black Frame next time you are taking a long exposure images to detect new Hot and Stuck Pixels on CCD defects.
At first, as explained in the previous section, you need to load a Black Frame corresponding to the image to correct. An automatic parsing will be processed on the Black Frame to find bad pixels. Note that the widget will remember the previous Black Frame used on the last session and it will be re-opened automatically with the next session.
The image panel and the original preview help you to pan within the image. The preview window shows the filter output using the current settings. Bad Pixels are highlighted on all preview areas.
Select an area to see bad pixels on preview and the filter result using'Separate View 'options of image panel. Choose the best Filter method to interpolate pixels or pixel blocks. These are the available filters:
Average: the pixels adjacent to the pixel block are averaged. The resulting color is assigned to all pixels in the block. For 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for one pixel-wide, horizontal or vertical stripes.
Linear: the pixels which have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are used to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim), or a group of linear curves (1-dim), which is then used to assign interpolated colors to the pixels in the block.
Quadratic: this is the default filtering method. The pixels which have a distance of 2 or less from the pixel block are used to calculate a bi-quadratic surface (2-dim), or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim), which is then used to assign interpolated colors to the pixels in the block.
Cubic: the pixels which have a distance of 3 or less from the pixel block are used to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim), or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to assign interpolated colors to the pixels in the block.
Below, you can see the Hot Pixels Correction tool applied to a color photograph taken with a deficient digital camera at 200 ISO sensitivity with a long exposure shot. The original image magnified to 300% is (1), the corrected image (2).
& digikam; The Anti Vignetting is a tool to correct image vignetting (under-exposure in the corners).
Wide angle lenses, especially those used in medium and large format photography, frequently do not uniformly illuminate the entire sensor plane. Instead, they & quot; vignettequot; (shade) the edges and corners of the image, substantially reducing the light reaching the sensor there. But telelenses may show vignetting too.
But there are disadvantages as well. Many center filters require a 1.5 or 2 f-stop filter factor adjustment, which may in turn necessitate a shutter speed so slow (since wide angle lenses, even with center filters, are best used at apertures of f/ 16 or smaller) that hand-holding the camera is impossible and motion blur becomes a problem when photographing moving objects.
With the wide exposure range of present-day film and the color (or grey-scale) depth of digital camera or film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transform to a raw image taken without the filter. This antivignetting tool applies a center filter transformation to an image employing an algorithm copyrighted by John Walker.
Three sliders give you control over the vignetting correction filter, and three more over the target image exposure:
Density: this option controls the degree of luminosity attenuation by the filter at its point of maximum density. The default density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a 1 f-stop filter factor (or, by no coincidence, a factor of 2 in luminosity). Increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting; reduce it for less.
Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma settings: processing an image with this antivignetting tool reduces the luminosity of pixels. You need to re-adjust the target image exposure with these options. These sliders give only positive values because you need only to increase this setting.
& digikam; If you want a finer exposure re-adjustment of the target image, leave the Brightness/ Contrast/ Gamma values at zero and use the Adjust Curve tool from Image Editor available under Color Adjust Curve menu entry.
This is an example of an anti vignetting correction applied to an image. The original image (1) shows vignetting in the corners, the corrected image (2) much less. A brightness and contrast correction is also applied to the target image by this tool.
& digikam; The Lens Distortion is a tool to correct spherical lens aberrations on the photos. It uses an algorithm copyrighted by David Hodson.
This tool treats the geometrical distortions. Chromatic aberrations will not be corrected by this tool.
The 2nd-order coefficient treats the main geometrical distortion of lenses and can correct the convex or concave shape of the image.
The 3rd-order coefficient has a similar rounding effect but levels off towards the edges. This correction is not employed in the tool.
The 4th-order coefficient corrects the far edges inversely to the 2nd-order rounding. Combining it with the 2nd-order correction the geometrical distortions can be almost completely eliminated.
Main: this value controls the amount of 2nd-order distortion. Negative values correct barrel distortions, while positive values correct pincushion distortion.
Edge: this value controls the amount of 4th-order distortion. The Edge control has more effect at the edges of the image than at the center. For most lenses, the Edge parameter has the opposite sign of the Main parameter.
Zoom: this value rescales the overall image size (1st-order correction). Negative values zoom out of the image, while positive values zoom in.
Brighten: this control adjusts the brightness in image corners. Negative values decrease the brightness image corners, while positive values increase it.
To help you to choose the best filter settings, the widget dialog illustrates with a thumbnail preview the distortion correction applied to a crossed mesh pattern. The values you apply to your image will be saved and come up with the same values as default the next time you call the tool.
The barrel-pincushion correction should be done before any crop or size changes (including perspective correction). In fact the Barrel-Pincushion corrections should be the very first step on the original image. If you crop the image and then use barrel correction the effect would be obviously wrong.
To help you finding the best correction the tool provides a vertical and horizontal guide. Move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dashed lines guide. Move the cursor to an important place in the image like the sea level or a building border and press the left mouse button for freeze the dashed lines position. Now, adjust the barrel/ pincushion correction to align with the guide.
When using pincushion correction the resulting image will have a black border in the corner. You will need to cut this out with a crop tool available in Transform Crop Image Editor menu or via the zoom slider of this dialog.
On most images using the barrel correction is enough, however with some shots such as front images, frames, paintings, the next logical step is to use perspective correction to make all the angles 90 degrees. Note that when you hold your camera by hand you almost always introduce some kind of slight perspective distortion.
This is an example of a barrel correction applied to church in north Norway. The original image is (1), the corrected image (2).
The algorithm is based on the method of the'Simulate Infrared Film 'tutorial of the GimpGuru. org web site available at this url. The filter tries to reproduce the famous Ilford(tm) SFX200 infrared film, cf. this url. This film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.
The left part of the dialog window lets you select the region to be shown in the preview section. Move the red rectangle with the mouse around to show the effect on different parts of the image.
The lower part provides the two controls, Film Grain and ISO sensitivity. Check the Add Film Grain box if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a high sensitivity film. The ISO-level slider modifies the amount of filmgrain added and the predominance of green color (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion mixer. Green pastures will become white as snow! Try it out.
Because the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film (with emphasis on green channel), one can not simulate infrared effect from black and white original photograph, since the color information is missing.
This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a color image taken in New Zealand's landscapes. The original image is (1) and the converted image is (2). The film sensitivity used to simulate the infrared film is ISO-400. Higher ISO values will create a kind of aura in the highlights.
The & digikam; Filmgrain filter is an easy tool to produce film grain on your images as known from classical high speed film material as, for example, the famous B/ W KodaK Tri-X. In order to increase film sensitivity, manufacturers employed larger silver grains in the photo emulsion.
The film grain effect gives your shot a particular mood or seems to transport it in time. The treated image acquires a timeless atmosphere, detached from every day life. If you want that gritty, art-house, street-photography grainy film look, especially in monochromatic photos, use this filter.
There is a slider calibrated in ISO-sensitivity to control the grain intensity and granularity. The default is set to ISO-2400, although higher values are often required. If you still want more grain, apply the filter several times.
This is an example of the film grain effect applied on a black and white image. The original image is (1) and the corrected image is (2). The film sensitivity used for simulate the film graininess is ISO-1600.
The & digikam; Oil Paint filter gives your image the look of an oilpainting. It uses an algorithm copyrighted by Pieter Voloshyn.
The & digikam; Oil Paint filter gives your digital images a nice oilpainting-like look. Images of nature and still lifes are well suited for this effect.
There are two sliders to control the effect. The upper slider selects the Brush Size between 1 and 5. Bigger brushes are better suited for large images. Smooth controls the smoothness or, seen from the other end, the jaggedness.
This is an example of the oil paint filter effect. The original image is (1) and the transformed image is (2). Brush Size for this 640 pixel size image is 1, Smooth is 17.
The & digikam; Charcoal filter uses the gradients of color and luminosity to produce a grey scale charcoal sketch. The lines defining the outline of the image are pronounced. Images with slowly changing gradients are not ideal for this effect. It is helpful to imagine what scene you would pick to do as a hand sketch yourself, in order to choose the image to start with.
There are two sliders to control the effect on a scale of 1-100. The upper slider selects the pencil size, whereas the second slider adjusts the contrast (smoothness).
This is an example of the charcoal filter. The original image is (1) and the transformed image is (2). Default values of 30 and 10 where applied. The result can be improved by adjusting the luminosity levels.
The & digikam; Emboss filter sculptures your image into 3-D as if it were stamped into wax. It uses an algorithm copyrighted by Pieter Voloshyn.
The & digikam; Emboss filter is a quick tool to render your images in a 3-D effect. It works particularly well on images with simple structure where color is not the most important content. The filter uses the difference between colors and luminosity to convert it into a grey, moon-like landscape lit from 10 o'clock.
The Depth control allows to define the contrast of the filtering. A value of 30 (10%) is the standard.
This is an example of the emboss filter. The original image is (1) and the transformed image is (2). The Depth applied is 10%.
With this filter set, you can transform an ordinary photograph into a work of art suitable for framing using distorting operations. It uses algorithms copyrighted by Pieter Voloshyn.
Block Waves 1: divides the image into cells and makes it look as if it is being viewed through glass blocks.
Block Waves 2: like Block Waves 1 but with another version of glass blocks distortion.
Some effects can take a long time to run and cause high CPU load. You can always abort an effect by pressing Abort button during preview rendering.
With this filter set, you can transform an ordinary photograph into a work of art suitable for framing using blurring operations. It uses algorithms copyrighted by Pieter Voloshyn.
Zoom Blur: blurs the image along radial lines starting from a specified center point. This simulates the blur of a zooming camera, thereby giving the photograph a dynamic expression as often seen in sport photography.
Radial Blur: blurs the image by rotating the pixels around the specified center point. This simulates the blur of a rotating camera.
Far Blur: blurs the image to simulate the effect of an unfocused camera lens. The subject seems to recede into the background.
Motion Blur: blurs the image by swishing the pixels horizontally. This simulates the blur of a linearly moving camera, i. e. like a shot taken from a car or train.
Softener Blur: blurs the image softly in the darker tones and strongly in the high lights. This gives photographs a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). It's ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photography, or adding a warm and subtle glow.
Shake Blur: blurs the image by randomly moving the pixels simulating the blur of an arbitrarily moving camera.
Smart Blur: finds the edges of color in photograph and blurs them without muddying the rest of the image.
Mosaic: blurs the image by dividing the photograph into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling those cells with average pixel value.
Some effects can take a long time to run and cause high CPU load. You can always abort an effect by pressing the Abort button during preview rendering.
The Raindrops is nice little tool to put raindrops onto your images. Naturally, it renders your image in a kind of wet look. It uses an algorithm copyrighted by Pieter Voloshyn.
Drop size obviously allows to change the size of the drops. As the drop size does n't automatically scale with the image size it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. Number changes the number and density of drops. Fish eye changes the optical effect of the drops across the image.
You can keep a zone clear of raindrops with the & digikam; Image Editor Select tool. Selecting the area to avoid (for example a face) before launching the Raindrops filter will keep it free from rain drops.
This is an example of the raindrops filter. The original image (1) shows a quiet sunset, the transformed image (2) indicates a sunset after a thunderstorm. Default values have been used for this example.
If the photograph shows a wrong orientation you can Flip or Rotate it to the orientation you would like by using Transform Flip/ Rotate tools available in Transform Rotate and Transform Flip menus.
The & digikam; Blowup Photograph is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photograph's size with minimal loss in image quality.
Rescaling an image to make it smaller is easy. The big question is: how can you blow up an image and keep the details sharp? How can one zoom in when the resolution boundary has been reached? How can one reinvent or guess the missing information to fill in the necessarily coarse image after upsizing? Well, the CImg algorithm we use here does an excellent job, try it out and see for yourself!
If the photograph has the wrong size, you can scale it to the size you would like by using Transform Resize tool. Select Transform Resize and adjust the target values. The Resize tool dialog is available below.
This image resizing tool uses a standard linear interpolation method to approximate pixels. If you want to up-size a small image with a better quality, try the Blowup tool.
Many image editing programs use some kind of interpolation & eg; spline interpolation to scale-up an image. & digikam; uses a more sophisticated approach. The algorithm underlying Blowup Photograph has been developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS lab in Caen/ France and is a part of the CImg project.
You have to tell the tool about the resizing you want to do. These settings are available in New Size tab and are listed below:
Maintain Aspect Ratio: if this option is enabled, setting the new image size will preserve the aspect ratio of the original image.
Regularity [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned with the bigger structures. The bigger this value, the more even the overall smoothing will be. This is necessary when much noise is present since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry. Also if you want to achieve a'van Gogh 'turbulence effect, setting it higher than 3 is recommended.
Save As and Load buttons are used to do just that. Any Blowup Photograph filter settings that you have set can be saved to the filesystem in a text file and loaded later.
Blowup Photograph is very fast in what it is doing, but it can take a long time to run and cause high CPU load. You may always abort computation by pressing Cancel button during rendering.
You can see below an Blowup Photograph example applied to a small color image area resized to x2. The original is (1), the Blowup result (3). The (2) preview is the result given to standard linear resizing method to compare.
Cropping a photograph is not only a common operation, but an often underestimated photographer's tool to compose an image. The Image Editor makes it very easy. To crop a photograph simply drag a rectangle over the image by holding down the & LMB; and moving the mouse. You will see a wire frame rectangle appear as you move the mouse.
When you release the button the area of the photograph that will be removed by a crop operation is greyed out. This allows you to get a good view of how your photograph will look once you have cropped it. You can change the size of the cropped area by dragging the corners of the rectangle, and you can create a new crop area simply by dragging out another rectangle.
Once you are happy with the crop, click on the The Image Editor Crop Button button on the toolbar and the photograph will be cropped (Ctrl; +X). Use the File Save or File Save As entries in the File menu to save the newly cropped photograph.
In the preview area you can resize the cropping rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. It will keep the ratio value set in the bottom of dialog.
In the Aspect Ratio Crop tool settings, you specify the Orientation as Portrait or Landscape. Portrait will always have the larger size assigned to the Height and Landscape to the Width.
Aspect Ratio Crop tool uses a relative ratio. That means it is the same if you use centimeters or inches and it does n't specify the physical size. For example, you can see below a correspondence list of traditional photographic paper sizes and aspect ratio crop.
At the far right of the dialog two buttons are available to move the crop selection automatically to the horizontal or vertical center of the image.
At the very bottom line of the dialog, the Max. Ratio button lets you set the crop area size to the maximum size according to the current aspect ratio settings and orientation.
The Aspect Ratio Crop tool remembers the settings depending on image orientation (horizontal or vertical). When you use the crop tool next time, these settings will be used as default values depending on the image orientation. The changed image dimensions are stored into the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflects the cropped image and not the original one.
The Composition Guide settings provides guiding elements to better compose your images. These guides are:
Harmonious Triangles: Harmonious divisions rely on the principle of similarity. Like the Rule of Thirds guide, Harmonious Triangles are another division of the image using a rectangle into equiangular harmonious triangles aligned with the diagonal.
Golden Mean: The Golden Mean is a ratio underlying numerous growth patterns throughout nature (from the spiral of a Nautilus shell to the petals of a sunflower), it has an uncanny way of showing up in all kinds of things we deem beautiful.
The Golden Ratio is the irrational number 1.618033988..., and it is usage dates back to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used it in the construction of their temples and pyramids. Artists and architects throughout time have used the Golden Ratio when composing their paintings, buildings, and even photographs, in order to give their creations a sense of natural order and beauty.
The ratio is inherent in the Fibonacci series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc;., where each succeeding number after 1 is equal to the sum of the two preceding numbers. The ratio formed 1:1.618 is the Golden Mean. A composition following this rule is considered visually harmonious.
The Golden Mean provides more fluid guidelines when used to compose an image. These guides are listed below:
The Golden Spiral guide will increase your odds of getting captivating results in your photographs. As opposed to Rule of Thirds, the Golden Spiral forms a fluid line for the eye to trace through the image. This style of composition will invite the viewer's gaze into the image along the line of the spiral, creating a more symmetrical visual flow, and an overall compelling viewing experience.
One more rule is a Golden Spiral Sections (or Golden Rectangles). These rectangles are used to build the Golden Spiral. There should be something leading the eye to the center of the composition. It could be a line or several subjects. This "something" could just be there without leading the eyes, but it would make its job.
The Golden Triangles is a derivative of the Golden Spiral discussed above. Its vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the Golden Rectangle. Note that unlike Harmonious Triangles, Golden Triangles are n't equiangular triangles. Placing diagonals along these lines can make an otherwise static subject appear more dynamic.
When you use Golden Triangles to break up your frame, you're creating an effect professional photographic experts call Dynamic Symmetry. Try to keep your focal subject on one of the intersecting points, and place other visual information into the triangles you've already divided out. The result will be a very attractive composition you may not have otherwise attained.
The Flip Horizontal and Flip Vertical options can be used to apply flip transformation to the harmonious divisions.
The Color button lets you set the guidelines color. If you have an high color contrast image, the guidelines may become invisible. By the way, you can adapt the color guide to the current image.
The & digikam; Free Rotation is a tool for image rotation by any arbitrary angle.
When taking an image it is all too easy to hold the camera not quite perfectly vertical or horizontal, resulting in an image where things are tilted at an angle. The way to fix this with the & digikam; Image Editor is to use the Free Rotation tool. Select Transform Free Rotation and adjust to the target angle.
Rotate your image by using the Angle slider (value in degrees). Press to Reset Values for reset the slider to zero. A rotating effect preview is available on the right side of the dialog. The new target image dimensions in pixels are shown.
For better orientation, the Free Rotation tool provides a vertical and horizontal guide. Move the mouse cursor under image preview to display the dashed line guide. Move the cursor to an supposedly vertical or horizontal feature in the image like the sea or a building border and press the left mouse button for freeze the dashed lines position. Now, adjust the angle accordingly with the guide.
After you have rotated an image, there will be unpleasant triangular "holes" at the corners. One way to fix them is to crop the image with Transform Crop Image Editor menu.
A more elegant way to crop the rotated image is to use the Auto-crop function. Choose anyone of the following options from the combo-box to your preference:
The Anti-aliasing checkbox will smooth the image a bit after rotation. Please read the warning above.
All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point called the reference point. This point is at the center of the item you are transforming and is displayed by a red circle.
To change the perspective, use the square areas at the image corners for dragging. The perspective preview is rendered automatically. On the right of the dialog you'll find a set of information witch help you to control the perspective change:
New Width: show the new image width in pixels including the empty area around the image resulting from the geometrical transformation.
New Height: show the new image height in pixels including the empty area around the image resulting from the geometrical transformation.
Top Left Angle: show the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the perspective area.
Top Right Angle: show the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the perspective area.
Bottom Left Angle: show the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the perspective area.
Bottom Right Angle: show the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the perspective area.
After applying the perspective adjustment, the image inevitably gets blurred a little bit. For a single adjustment, the amount of blurring is quite small, but two adjustments cause twice as much blurring as one, and there is no reason to blur things more than you have to.
After you have adjusted the perspective of an image there will be unpleasant triangular "holes" at the corners. One way to fix them is to crop the image with Transform Crop Image Editor menu.
The Shear tool is used to shift one part of an image to one direction and the other part to the opposite direction. For instance, a horizontal shearing will shift the upper part to the right and the lower part to the left. This is not a rotation: the image is distorted. In other words, it will turn a rectangle into a parallelogram. This tool is available from Transform Shear menu.
Shear your image by using the Horizontal Angle and Vertical Angle sliders (values in degrees). You can shear along either Horizontally and vertically at the same time. Click on the Reset Values reset. A shearing effect preview is shown on the center of dialog window. The new target image dimensions in pixels are displayed at the right side of dialog.
To assist you in aligning, the tool provides a vertical and horizontal guide. Move the mouse cursor under image preview for display the dashed lines guide. Move the cursor to an important place in the image like the sea or a building border and press the left mouse button for freeze the dashed lines position. Now, adjust the shear correction according with the guide.
After applying a shearing adjustment, the image inevitably gets blurred a little bit. For a single shearing, the amount of blurring is quite small, but two shears cause twice as much blurring as one, and there is no reason to blur things more than you have to.
After you have sheared an image, there will be unpleasant triangular "holes" at the corners. One way to fix them is to crop the image with Transform Crop Image Editor menu.
& digikam; relies on a number of libraries and support packages to load and save image formats. Which image formats are available will depend on the availability of these libraries on your system and, in some cases, on the way that those libraries have been compiled. On most distributions you will find that a wide range of image formats are viewable within & digikam;.
This dependence on other libraries means that it is not possible to give a definitive list of all of the formats that will be available on your system. At the very least JPEG, PNG, and TIFF should be available.
& digikam; only displays files that are in formats that it understands. It does this by looking at the file extension on the files and checking this against a predefined list. If the file extension is in the list & digikam; will show the file in the Image View. You can change the list of file extensions that & digikam; will accept, see the Configuration section for more details.
Almost all digital cameras store photographs in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. Many cameras enable you to select which of these formats to use. A full description of these formats can be found at the Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both of these formats.
Image compression is the application of data compression schemes on digital images. It is done through reducing redundancy of the image data in order to be able to store or transmit data in an efficient form.
JPEG 2000 is supported as well. It provides for the same compression ratio the better (smoother) results compared to JPEG. The 2000 version has the option of being lossless if so specified in the settings.
If you want to learn more about RAW image format visit the very helpful guides Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape, and Cambridge in Colour. You can convert RAW format images into JPEG or TIFF in & digikam; using the RAW Image Converter plugin. See the Configuration section for information about using plugins with & digikam;.
& digikam; supports RAW image loading only; relying on the DCRAW program which is included in & digikam; core and supports over 200 RAW file formats. All supported cameras are listed at the bottom of Dave Coffin's web page. The table below shows a short list of camera RAW files supported by & digikam;:
Many digital cameras support taking of short movie clips. These clips are usually stored in AVI or MPEG format. & digikam; understands these formats and will generate thumbnails for the movie files. However, & digikam; is not a movie editing application and it does not have any built-in movie viewing or editing capabilities. If you double click on a movie file & digikam; will use your & kde; settings to choose a viewing application to use.
Go forward to the previously visited View using history. You can only go forward if you've just gone back.
Synchronize the metadata between database and the file's metadata of all items of the current Main Window. The images will inherit the database metadata, not the other way around as in this menu.

Any configured digital camera will be listed here. You can use the "Add Camera" menu entry to add a new camera to the list. Please, read the Setup Camera Section for more information.
Kipi-plugin that exports the images series into a KML structure. KML files can then be opened and displayed with GoogleEarth.
If you swap step 4 and 5, which is well possible if the initial contrast is already very good, you can do the first 4 adjustment in the same plugin, the white balance
Many of the tools you may need for photographic editing are included with & digikam;. Their description follows here.
All Image Editor tools like Sharpen, Blur, Noise Reduction, Refocus, Unsharp Mask, & etc;. use a common dialog style that previews the effect before applying the filter to the current image. Below you see the & quot; Apply Texturequot; tool in action using this common dialog layout:
(1): The seven buttons to the top left select the comparison style of the preview area. The modes are:
Split vertically without duplication. The left area shows the original whereas the right side shows the filter applied to the continuation of the selected zoom.
Split horizontally without duplication. The top area shows the original whereas the lower area shows the filter applied to the continuation of the selected zoom.
Split vertically. The left area shows the original and the right one the filter effect for comparison.
Split horizontally. The top area shows the original and the lower one the filter effect for comparison.
'Mouse over 'style: preview when mouse is off the preview (in the settings area), otherwise shows original.
(2): There are two buttons that can be toggled to show over or underexposure. The colors can be customized in the general setup page.
(3): The preview selector frame. Click and drag with the mouse on the floating frame to move it on the image. The preview area on the left of dialog is updated accordingly.
(5): At the lower left corner: there is help and a reset to defaults button (all settings are remembered from the last use of the plugin).
The properties sidebar shows the essential information about the selected image which are largely self-explanatory. It is grouped into the following sections:
Photograph Properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters when taking the photograph. This data is taken from the EXIF data fields if available
The left sidebar is a geo-search tool. Press the Ctrl; left mouse button to pull-up a square as indicated. All images falling within the coordinates of that square will be shown.
& kcoloredit; is a palette files editor. It can be used for editing color palettes and for color choosing and naming.
The palette files installed by & kde; can be either system-wide or the user ones. The latter are in you private & kde; configuration folders, and they are named Custom Colors and Recent Colors.
In the Open File dialog, you may choose from a list of installed palettes, or browse folders for files.
The cursor is visible as a line in the palette view. It can be moved by clicking on an area beside a color.
It points to the color after it. The color, if any, is described below the palette view. You may edit its name there.
It can be used to make a selection. A selection can be made by clicking on an area beside a color, so to move the cursor there, and by moving the mouse then with the left mouse button pressed.
If the At cursor check-box near the Add Color button is checked, a color from the color chooser is put at the cursor. The color is either inserted or it overwrites another one, depending on whether the Overwrite mode is chosen. The mode can be chosen by checking the Overwrite check-box, that is next to the At cursor one.
A selection, that can be made as it was written in the previous section, can be used with the copy, cut and paste operations.
& kcoloredit; uses the following format for clipboard data: for each color three numbers for red, green and blue components, respectively, and an optional color name, followed by a new line character if there is another color. Therefore, if for example three numbers are in the clipboard, they can be pasted by & kcoloredit; as a color.
The palette colors and the color selection output color can be dragged with a mouse.
Pick a color from anywhere on the screen, and find it in the color selector on the left.
& kgraphviewer; is a & graphviz; & dot; graph viewer for & kde;. The & graphviz; programs are free-software layout engines for graphs. Graphs are commonly used in scientific domains and particularly in computer science. Until now, there was a lack of a modern & GUI; to look at the graphs. The programs that come with & graphviz; are in my opinion out-of-date & X11; or & tcltk; applications with few features.
The & kgraphviewer; project aims to replace these tools with a modern, user-friendly & GUI; with all the power of a well integrated & kde; application.
& kgraphviewer; is a & graphviz; & dot; graph viewer for & kde;. The & graphviz; programs are free-software layout engines for graphs. & kgraphviewer; displays the graphs in a modern, user-friendly & GUI; with all the power of a well integrated & kde; application. It has the following features:
Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change in & kate; 's view of the graph would re-layout and reload the file in & kgraphviewer;);
Menu to open the file in & kate; or to open a katepart inside the & kgraphviewer; window;
Loading of large and huge graphs (currently, there are performance problems at around 1000 nodes, and a hack to ignore nodes above a specified limit);
Other required software: & kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tool & dot; for graph layout. Its dependencies are:
The main window displays the loaded graphs, each in its own tab. Initially, if you start & kgraphviewer; without arguments, its main window will be empty as in the screenshot below. In this case, the toolbar contains only the Open File and the (empty) Recently Opened Files items. Click on the first one to open the standard Open File dialog.
After selecting one or several & dot; files, the main window looks like the next screenshot below:
As you can see, if the graph is larger than the available area, a bird's-eye view is shown in one corner. You can choose with the context menu whether the optimal position of this overview should be automatically computed for you, or place it where you want yourself.
Use the mouse wheel (up and down with no modifier, left and right with the & Alt; key pressed);
Zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. You can see below the maximum zoom-out factor on a graph.
If a file currently loaded in & kgraphviewer; is modified by another program, the following dialog is shown:
You can choose to reload the graph or to ignore the change. You can also get & kgraphviewer; to remember your choice, so it will do the same thing the next time. If you later want to modify your choice, choose the Settings Configure & kgraphviewer; menu item. See.
When you open a graph file from outside a running & kgraphviewer; instance, & eg; from a file browser or the command line, you have the choice to open a new & kgraphviewer; window or to open the graph in a new tab in the existing window. This is done with the dialog below.
As for the previous option, you can save your default choice and modify it later in the configuration dialog.
At start-up, you can choose to reopen the graphs that you had opened the previous time. Again, you can save your choice and change it later.
You can also choose how to divide the graph on multiple pages. The number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen independently.
Finally, when using multiple pages, you can choose to make the part of the graph on each page to fit its page like above, not keeping the aspect ratio, or to keep it. In the latter case, the pages will not be filled.
Page preview setup to fit on multiple pages without header and with a different font
The Reload page allows to change the behavior of & kgraphviewer; when a file is changed on disk by another application. You can choose a default action (reload automatically or ignore changes), or to be asked each time.
The Opening page allows to change the behavior of & kgraphviewer; when a graph file is opened from outside the current session. You can choose a default action (open in an existing window or in a new one), or to be asked each time.
The Session Management page allows to change the & kgraphviewer; 's start-up behavior. You can choose a default action (reopen files of the previous session or not), or to be asked each time.
The context menu, usually obtained by clicking the & RMB; in the graph view, offers some other possibilities:
This allows to choose between various & graphviz; layout algorithms or to choose your own one. The entries, as described on the & graphviz; homepage, are the following:
& dot; algorithm, default for directed graphs. It produces hierarchical or layered drawings of directed graphs. The layout algorithm lays edges in the same direction (top to bottom, or left to right), and then attempts to avoid edge crossings and to reduce edge length.
& neato; algorithm, default for undirected graphs. It produces spring model layouts. It uses the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.
& fdp; algorithm, for undirected graphs. It produces spring model layouts. It implements the Fruchterman-Reingold heuristic including a multigrid solver that handles larger graphs and clustered undirected graphs.
& circo; algorithm. It produces a circular layout, after Six and Tollis 1999, Kauffman and Wiese 2002. Suitable for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.
Opens a dialog allowing you to specify a layout command executed by the shell. This command should accept one parameter, the graph file name, and write its layout on stdout in the xdot language. This way, you can give specific options to one of the previous commands, or apply a filter modifying your graph before running it through & dot;.
Determine the graph type (directed or not) and apply the default algorithm to it, currently & dot; and & neato; respectively.
When checked, the Bird's-eye view is displayed when necessary. Otherwise, it is hidden and its positioning menu is disabled.
Displays the What's This mouse pointer. Click with it on a & GUI; element to obtain help using it (if there is such help available).
You can find a list of changes at this link and in the ChangeLog file at the root of the distribution archive.
& kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tools for graphs layout. It requires the following programs to be installed:
No special configuration is necessary to use & kgraphviewer;. See the Settings menu for some options.
The Icon Editor window is separated in five areas: main toolbar, tools toolbar, statusbar, color palette and the grid, where you paint the icon.
Create a new icon. If the current file has been modified you will be asked if you want to save the changes. After that a dialog will open where you can choose to create the icon from scratch or from a template.
Redo the last action undone. If no actions have been undone, this action is disabled.
Paste the contents of the clipboard as a new image (if the clipboard contains a valid icon).
Gray scale the icon image. This may create colors not conformant to the & kde; icon palette.
Does n't change the icon but changes the current drawcolor to the color clicked on.
The status bar keeps you informed of current operations. From left to right, it tells you the x, y coordinates of the pixel you are working on, the size of the current canvas, the zoom factor, and the current number of colors in the icon.
Paste the contents of the clipboard as a new image into a new Icon Editor window (if the clipboard contains a valid icon).
Selecting the Settings Configure & kiconedit;... menu item will open a configuration dialog with the tree tabs Icon Templates, Background and Icon Grid.
Add..., Edit... and Remove the templates for Standard File, Source File, Compressed File & etc;.
Select to Paste transparent pixels or Show rulers and set a Solid Color or a Checkerboard as Transparency Display. You can set the Checkerboard Size: to Small, Medium or Large and choose Color 1: and Color 2: of the checkerboard.
The Kipi acquire images plugin provides tools to capture new images and save them to the collections.
This plugin can be used to capture and add new images to the host application from external sources. Actually, two actions can be used:
Scan images: use the Kooka interface for scanning images from either a flat scanner supported by the Sane project or a another capture source like video streams (for this to work you must have installed Kooka and Sane).
When you open the Scan images menu a dialog comes up that lets you choose between the available acquisition sources on your computer. Choose the one you want to capture from. You can also set the default source for the next time.
When the Kooka dialog window comes up, make your choices of acquisition settings by altering the default values. Look at the preview and crop it before making the final decision. The estimated file size is indicated in the lower right corner. See the dedicated Kooka manual for more information.
Make sure that the dialog is fully visible since some settings might be hidden if the window is too narrow.
Press the scan button and wait until the scanning is finished and the Save Target Option dialog appears. Here you can alter the compression quality and the image file type (be aware that the BMP type is not compressed and creates large files). The second item in that dialog let you choose (or create) the folder the image will be saved to.
The Screenshot acquisition mode you can choose from 1st menu item- > Import- > Screenshot... A dialog window comes up providing you with various snapshot modes:
Deselect the Grab the entire desktop item to shoot a single window under the mouse cursor.
When the Hide all host application windows item is selected the calling host application will disappear to give way to the other screens/ windows. Otherwise you'll - after the delay - shoot the screen/ window actually visible (if you've deselected Grab the entire desktop the window under the mouse pointer will be shot).
The delay control determines how long Screenshot will wait until the exposure is happening. If you need to navigate to some other screens set the delay high enough to give you the time for navigation.
Once the screenshot has been taken the Save Target Option dialog appears with the same options as described above.

On successful signup FlickrUploadr will be allowed to send photos to flickr website. The user will be presented with the following page on successful signup.
Simply close the browser windows and return to the host application Dialog. On clicking Yes, user will see the interface to upload photos to Flickr. Described in the next section.
When the flickrexport plugin is invoked for second time or later the user is greeted with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions flickrexport plugin has. The uploading process requires "write" permissions. The plugin does n't allow any other permission as of now. User is asked if he wants to proceed with his current permissions.
The Add Photos button should be clicked once user has set in the other options in the dialog. On clicking this button user a image selector dialog opens up, user can select the photos he wants to upload and click ok. On clicking ok the image uploading starts.
The Tags field can be filled with a series of words (comma separated) which will be assigned as tags to the images uploaded.
The Public, Friends, and Family Checkbox can be checked to have appropriate access permission on the images you upload. By default the images upload are private.
If the Resize photos before uploading option is selected, the photos will be resized before uploading. The values will be read from the Maximum dimension combobox.
The Maximum Dimension combobox can be used to adjust the maximum height to which the photos will be resized before uploading. The width calculation will be done so as to have the aspect ratio conserved.
The Kipi Gallery Export plugin is a tool for export image collections to a remote Gallery server.
The Kipi plugin Gallery Export currently has no documentation. If you are interested in rectifying that situation, please contact Kipi team mailing list kde-imaging@kde. org.
The Kipi Geolocation plugin allows for adding and editing GPS coordinates of picture metadata. The geo-data is stored into the image (EXIF tags) and the location can be displayed in an external browser map.
The Kipi plugin Geolocation provides the tools to localize pictures geographically in the common spherical coordinate system (used by GPS/ Galileo). Altitude, latitude and longitude are being used.
In order to correlate your images with geo data you need to have a GPS track available as a XML file in gpx format (gpsbabel and gpsman can do the download and conversion of track data from a GPS device for you).
Image Geolocation Correlator. This interface can correlate a previously selected number of pictures with a registered GPS track.
Select the images you want to correlate in the application main view, then call the menu. The above dialog will show up. To indicate possible time/ location correlation you have to load a track file with Load GPX File that contains of course GPS data taken at the same time and location as the pictures with your photo camera.
When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is done showing the attributed coordinates in red. GPS track data is invariably recorded in GMT time, so you need to match the camera time with GMT, which can be done with Time Zone. Select the camera time zone here!
The Max. time gap setting specifies the limit within which GPS time and camera time shall be deemed coincident. The maximum value is 2000 seconds.
If you have no track data for pictures that were taken in the same place you can just manually edit a gpx file and apply it to those images. The 2000 seconds time gap will then correlate all pictures taken within two 3rds of an hour.
The option Interpolate and Difference in min. can be used if there is no match of data. If you know that in reality there is a location match despite a larger time gap between camera and GPS, you can set this limit here and click on the Correlate button to interpolate.
The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. This comes handy if there is a series of photos taken at the same location. Since the coordinates are memorized from one dialog call to another, it is as easy as clicking onto OK to set the previous data to the current photo.
Otherwise the location can be found and fixed iteratively with the displayed map. Click on the region of interest, zoom in, adjust location by clicking again, and so on until sufficient accuracy is achieved. The altitude must always be entered manually. The map can be switched between map mode, satellite image or mixed mode.
Completely outside of the kipi-plugin context, the are ways to GPS tag images. Here a little script is given that uses the exiftool to tag a batch of images.
The Kipi images gallery plugin is a tool for exporting a set of Albums to an HTML page.
This powerful plugin can export your Albums into a HTML page compliant to 4.01 version for web publication in the form of an image gallery. You can easily select the Albums to export in an HTML page and set a big parameters list for the HTML rendering. UTF-8 encoding is used for a best internationalization.
The plugin has four tabs to adapt the settings. The Selection tab allows you to select all Albums you want to export to HTML. Just check the respective Albums (they are displayed without hierarchical nesting). The three buttons to the right help to quickly select large amounts of Albums. The frame below shows the Album ID-picture with the text that will appear as a header of the HTML page.
The Look tab defines the general look and layout of each page. This tab is largely self-explanatory. The Create pages for each image check box will create a gallery with a HTML page per image, that is, if you click onto an image a new page will open showing the image within the web browser. If you leave this box unchecked clicking the images will directly open them with the default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow.
The Album tab defines the settings of where and how to store the gallery with all its associated images. Select a folder with write access where you want the gallery to be written to. A sub-folder named KIPIHTMLExport will be created containing everything.
If JPEG file format is selected for target resizing images, all EXIF information will be preserved from original JPEG files.
With the Set different color depth check box you can change the default color depth. This will of course influence the filesize. The rest of the setting are rather self-explanatory.
The Thumbnails tab allows to set some of the Album tab settings for the thumbnails (that are the small images shown in the gallery).
A progress dialog giving a feedback indicate to user. Press Cancel button during this stage if you want abort the process.
When all jobs are completed, this dialog will not closed automatically and user can consult the progress messages if any errors occurs durring this stage. The web browser will be started automaticly at end to display a gallery preview. Press Close button to close dialog.
The Kipi imageviewer is a very fast and flexible tool for viewing images, based on OpenGL
The KIPI imageviewer allows to display a selection of images and to do basic operations, such as rotation, zooming or panning. The usage of the viewer is only based on keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures. It was placed emphasis mainly on speed in displaying as well as fast access to the functions.
On startup, an image is displayed in fullscreen mode by default. It can be changed to windowed mode
The Kipi JPEG lossless plugin is a tool to transform the images without loss in quality due to compression.
This plugin is available from within the host application. It allows (for the below listed transformations) to save images in JPEG format, which usually looses precision every time you save it (otherwise there would not be no size reduction) without losing any quality nor metadata information:
As a consequence of the lossless storage the file size will be larger (similar to the lossless PNG format) since there's no compression of the color coding information.
The Kipi Camera Client plugin is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.
The Kipi plugin KameraKlient currently has no documentation. If you are interested in rectifying that situation, please contact Kipi team mailing list kde-imaging@kde. org.
The Kipi plugin Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. If you are interested in rectifying that situation, please contact Kipi team mailing list kde-imaging@kde. org.
Using the metadata plugin Import function allows to copy data from one image to another. Select the image you want ot copy to in the main application. Then call the import function, which will open a file browser where you select the source image (the one you want to copy the metadata from). Click OK and the data will be copied over.
This feature does not work for all image formats. You can import from everything but not write to everything. JPEG is supported for writing. Please refer to the exiv2 capabilities to know which formats are supported.
The Kipi MPEG Encoder plugin is a tool for converting a series of images into a diashow-style MPEG file.
The MPEG Encoder plugin can be used to convert the selected images into a MPEG sequence with a defined duration and merge all images in an single MPEG file. This plugin applies the "MjpegTools" and "ImageMagick" packages. Between the images, you can insert a basic transition. You can also add an audio track to the images sequence using MP2 or WAV files.
All images will be automatically scaled to the correct size of the selected video format. A background color can be selected. You can use this plugin to build some DVD/ XVCD/ SVCD/ VCD image portfolios for your home DVD player. Use the K3b program to create this media.
First you have to select the images to be packed into MPEG from the host application browser. Then call from Tools Create MPEG Slideshow menu from the host application window.
The before selected images appear in the Image Files in Portfolio list box. Use this box to order your files or to modify the content of the list.
When you are happy with the content, go on with the other settings. The video format can be chosen from four (DVD/ XVCD/ SVCD/ VCD) different formats. If the MPEG file shall be played over a TV set, select the TV standard from PAL, SECAM and NTSC. PAL is the default value and the probable choice in central Europe.
Then you can choose the display duration per image, it scales in seconds. The list box below allows to select the transition behavior between the images. A low value goes with an rather sudden change whereas a higher value creates a smooth transition.
The next selector lets you free choose the preferred background color. In doubt leave it black. The'MPEG Output Filename 'box specifies the output filename and its path (location). Leave the mpg ending but change the path and filename as you wish.
If you point in the'Audio Input Filename 'to an audio file, it will be integrated into the MPEG file. So if you're done with the setting, click on the Encode button to launch the conversion. Depending on your computer speed go and drink a short or long coffee and enjoy the slideshow when its finished.
If the plugin complains about encoders or tools missing you can set the path to the programs "MjpegTools" and "ImageMagick" at the lower right Settings button.
The print wizard allows multiple images to be combined into single sheets of paper in standard photo sizes for printing. The combined images can also be automatically opened with the image editor Gimp for enhancement or for direct printing using the Gimp-Print plugin. The combined images can also be output directly to jpeg files.
With this Kipi-plugin you can import/ convert your images stored in RAW format to three formats of your choice (JPEG, TIFF, PPM).
The conversion is actually based on Dave Coffin's command line tool dcraw (Dave: "Do n't expect dcraw to produce the same images as software provided by the camera vendor. Sometimes dcraw gives better results!").
Select the RAW file to convert and open the plugin from the host application. The Raw Image Converter window in single mode will appear. Click on Preview to show the effect of your settings taking shape.
Now you can adjust the available check and value boxes to optimise the conversion process. The first checkbox indicates to use the camera settings for white balance. The essential parameters like brightness, and red/ blue amplifier may be adjusted. If the result is not quite optimal, do n't worry, it is always possible to finetune the image later on.
A Four color RGBG conversion can be selected to use contrast information. (If your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG setting has no effect).
If you're happy with the preview, choose one of three output formats to save the conversion result. The file name will stay the same, the extension only changes. JPEG uses the lossy algorithm and produces the smallest output file size.
The tagged image format (TIFF) preserves all information of your image whilst using lossless LZW compression.
If you intend to work a lot on your images or if it is likely that you have to reuse it later on, then do n't use JPEG format because it allows a limited number of operations only before it deterioates visibly. TIFF and PPM are better suited to keep the original data.
If you choose JPEG as Save Format then the meta-data included in RAW file will be included in the JPEG files like Exif information.
When you have finished click the Process button to start the conversion. If you want abort image conversion, press Abort button.
The batch mode converter allows you to convert several images in one go. Use this mode when you're are sure of the best settings, i. e. try it out in single conversion mode first.
The available setting are mostly identical to the single mode dialog. Here you have the additional option to overwrite existing files (which you might have created in an earlier try). The preview option is not available here. A progress bar indicate the conversion status in live.
This plugin can be used for batch recompress images in an Album. It use "convert" program from "ImageMagick" package. The image files formats supported are:
This plugin can be used for batch rename image files in an Album. You can set the prefix name to use, the start index value, and the timestamp.
This plugin can be used for batch resize images in an image collection. It use "convert" program from "ImageMagick" package. You can resize up or down the images size. 3 resizing types have been implemented:
Proportional (1 dim.): standard auto-resizing using one dimension. The width or the height of the images will be automatically selected in depending of the images orientation. The images aspect ratio are preserved.
Proportional (2 dim.): auto-resizing using two dimensions. The images aspect ratio are preserved. For example, you can use that for to adapt your images size to your screen size.
Non proportional: non proportional resizing using two dimensions. The images aspect ratio are n't preserved.
Prepare to print: prepare the image for a photographic printing. The user can set the print resolution and the photographic paper size. The target image will be adapted to the good dimensions (included the background size, margin size, and background color).
With this Kipi-plugin you can e-mail the selected images with your favorite e-mail agent. A resizing items operation is possible. You can use drag and drop to add more images in the list to send.
Upon opening of the plugin from the host application the Images window will appear with your pre-selected images already in the list to be sent. With the Add Images button a file browser opens to add more files as needed in the usual file selection manner. The image under the cursor in the list is displayed on the right side.
You can use drag and drop capability between the host application window and the image file list for add new items to e-mail.
When clicking on the second button Remove Images the selected images (highlighted in the list) will be removed from the send list.
When you have finished selecting your files, click OK to open the'new e-mail 'dialog window of your favorite e-mail client. You just need to add the addressee and the subject. The selected images will be already there as attachments.
Be sure not to overload your own or your addresses e-mail transmission limit, most providers limit the e-mail size to some megabytes of data. Use several e-mails if you want to send a lot of data.
The mail dialog is used to change the settings of the images to be sent. These settings will be remembered when you close the plugin until you change them.
Select your favorite e-mail client from the drop-down menu. (If you use Thunderbird, the field below will be available to select the correct path according to your installation).
If you want to use GMail service, you need to install GMailAgent in your computer, available at this url.
If you select Add Comments in the Attached File the comments included with the images will be merged to a text file and attached in the mail.
The PNG format on New Images Format drop-down menu is not well adapted to reduce photographic images file size, but it is best suited for compressing lossless items like TIFF file format. PNG must be used if you use a speed internet dialup and if you want preserved the photo quality. Else, JPEG is the recommended format.
If you choose JPEG as New Images Format and if the original files were in JPEG format, then the original Exif data included is preserved in e-mailed images.
When all jobs are completed, this dialog will not closed automatically and user can consult the progress messages if any errors occurs during this stage. The mail agent will be started automatically at end. Press Close button to close dialog.
Upon opening of the plugin from the host application the Advanced Slide Show window will appear asking questions as to how you want to stage your slideshow. You can choose between the selected images and all images in the same album.
The Use OpenGL Slideshow Transitions checkbox enables very smooth image transitions using the OpenGL display mode. Be sure to have OpenGL enabled on your graphics card, since otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.
The Print Filename checkbox enables the image filename to be displayed in the lower left corner.
The Loop checkbox enabled will run the whole show in an endless loop (until manually stopped with Esc;).
The Shuffle Image checkbox enables to display randomly the images (not using the current images collection order).
The Delay Between Images may be set in millisecond steps. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. The best timing depends also a bit on your computer power and the transition effect. Try it out before you show it to your friends!
There are more than a dozen Transition Effects available which you can choose from. The Random selection will change the transition effect with every image.
During slideshow, user can access to a tool bar on the upper left screen corner. Move the mouse cursor to the top left of the screen for enable it.
With this tool bar, user can drive the progress, for pausing/ playing slideshow, back to the preview image, go to the next image, and stopping slideshow.
On the lower left screen corner you can see the current image file name, the current image id on the slideshow, and the total number of images include in.
The Kipi plugin Time Adjust currently has no documentation. If you are interested in rectifying that situation, please contact Kipi team mailing list kde-imaging@kde. org.
The Kipi wall paper plugin is a tool for push an image in the desktop background.
This plugin place the current selected image in the KDE desktop in according with the menu sub-option selected:
Once you have annotated your images and videos, & kphotoalbum; is ready to let you browse through your images, see. If you compare that to, you will see that there now is items available in each of the categories for People, Places, and Keywords.
In the browser window you can see the categories you typed information into when annotating your images and videos. In addition there are items for searching based on EXIF information on images, browsing the folder structure of your hard disk, and of course showing the actual thumbnails. Lets describe each item in turn.
Pressing the mouse on People, the browser window will change, as you can see in.
If we now continue selecting a new person, then we will get to the images containing both people. Continuing that way you can narrow the set of images that you have in mind down to a few images from a set of thousands.
When you are done limiting the scope of images, you may select the View Thumbnails icon, to see exactly those images matching your current scope.
Looking at you will see that each person has the same icon in front of his name. & kphotoalbum; is actually capable of showing a preview image for each individual person This of course also applies to places, keywords, and other categories you have defined yourself. as can be seen in.
To show images along with the names, choose the tool button to the very right of the toolbar, that will bring up a popup menu, where you can chose which view you want to use for the given category. Notice views must be configured for each category - that way you may for example use an icon view for people, but a plain list view for keywords (in case you ca n't come up with good images for your keywords).
It is, however, your job to tell it which images to use for each individual person. To do so, you must open the viewer (see), and from the context menu choose show category editor, this will bring up the category editor which can be seen in. In the category editor you choose the image for the given person. In the viewer its possible to zoom to part of the image, and that way crop what part should be shown.
If you chose the Search item in the browser, you will get to a dialog with great resemblance to the dialog you used for setting properties of your images. You can see this dialog in below.
If you type a string in the label or description field, then that text will be searched for using substring searches. Likewise you can also specify a date to search for, either as part of a date, say 1971, or as a complete date. You may also specify date ranges, like 1971-1980.
The options item allow a very limited form of writing expression, as you can see an example of in the. Here we search for images with Jesper, but without Anne Helene.
This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. If you are not the type who likes reading documentation, but rather just want to try out things, here are a few alternatives:
Go to the kphotoalbum; Homepage, and look at the quick overview, screen shoots, and introduction videos.
Start & kphotoalbum;, and accepts its offer for a demo (If this is your first time you start it), or go to Help menu and select Run & kphotoalbum; demo. That will load & kphotoalbum; with a number of images, and let you browse around.
If you prefer to print out this document, then you may find it as on long HTML document at kphotoalbum; 's Homepage
At the bottom of the & kphotoalbum; main window, you will find the data bar (see). As the name indicates it shows date statistics over the images in your database.
The date bar offers you a number of different granularities, where each bar displays a different time range. The range are years, month, weeks, days, hours, and 10 minutes. shows you part of my database where each bar shows only 10 minutes.
The date bar is interactive in two ways, first you may navigate the thumbnail view from the database - selecting a date will scroll the thumbnail view so the first image from that date is displayed. Second, when you navigate around in the thumbnail view, the date bar will update to display the date of the images currently displayed.
You may also drag out a range in the data bar. You do so by pressing and dragging the mouse in the ruler part of the date bar, i. e. on the time stamps. When you select a range, the thumbnail viewer will display only images from that range. You cancel a selection by pressing the cancel button at the left side of the datebar.
& kphotoalbum; offers two possibilities for generating HTML from your photo album. One is the implementation build into & kphotoalbum;, the other is available as an plugin (see). This section will describe the build in version, which you may find in the menubar File Generate HTML
Before HTML pages are generated, you need to specify a bit of information, split over the three pages Content, Layout and Destination. The following section describes each page in detail.
First you specify the title of the overview pages, plus a description generated on these pages. See kphotoalbum; example HTML pages to see an example of this.
Next you specify whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be generated, and put on the overview page. See for details on export files.
Finally you may specify which information should be generated on the HTML pages. This way you may skip generating information which might be obvious to the reader of the pages (say these images was from the party we all attended). Notice, & kphotoalbum; does currently not allow you to exclude certain categories from the export file, so do n't rely on this as a way of excluding information you do not want readers of your pages to see.
On the layout page you specify what your HTML pages should look like. Most of the options on this page are straight forward, and do not need further description here.
At the bottom of this page it is possible to specify several resolution for images. This way people reading your pages are not forced to download images in large resolutions, say 1600x1200, just to see it on a monitor not offering more than say 800x600.
At any time your readers may change resolution among those you specified. That way they may browse through your images in low resolution (and thus fast download time), and when they see an image of special interest, they may change to high resolution.
On the destination page you specify several directories and URL's specifying where your pages goes.
The philosophy is that you specify a base directory for all your generations, and for each generation specify a new subdirectory.
First you need to specify the base directory for all your images. This directory will be remembered from session to session, and allows you to once and for all tell where all subsequent images should go. Here you may specify a directory, or any protocol supported by KDE. Examples includes:
Once you are done generating your images, you may want to check whether they are really available to your audience. If you specify a URL in the Base URL line edit, a web browser will be spawned once HTML pages has been generated. The URL you specify here should match the directory you specified above. Thus the web browser will be started on the subdirectories of this URL.
Once you have generated HTML pages, your pages may still not be in their final destination, you may still need special upload procedures out of the control of & kphotoalbum;. For the Import feature (see) to work, you need to specify the final destination of the pages. Again this does not include the subdirectory of the current generation.
The three line edits described above are all base directories and base URL's. At these locations a new subdirectory will be created named with the name you specify in Output Directory.
If you attend a family party, a company meeting, a conference, or any other event where other & kphotoalbum; users may be present, you may wish to share your images with those people. You may of course choose to generate HTML pages for them to browse, but given you already have spent time classifying all images (Who is on the images, where were they taken etc), there are no reason for them to redo all that work.
& kphotoalbum; allows you to export a set of your images into a. kim file, which other people may import into their database, to get your classification for these images.
Two different kind of. kim files exists, inlines or externals, referring to whether the images them self are located in the file or at some other location. Placing the images in the file has the obvious advantage that the file is self contained, while it has the equally obvious disadvantage of the file being rather big.
There are two places from which you may generate a. kim file, namely directly from File Export..., or along with HTML pages (see). Creating a. kim file during HTML export will create an external. kim file.
External. kim files will search for images in one of two ways. First it will try to look for the images next to the. kim file, and if not found, it will search for them at the URL specified when the. kim file was created. Notice the later is only possible for. kim files created during HTML export.
This section will tell you about the export dialog which you get to from File Export....
The most important part of this dialog is specifying whether the. kim file should be internal or external (see description above). You have the following three options:
Manual copy next to. kim file - Here you must copy the images yourself next to the. kim file
Automatically copy next to. kim file - here & kphotoalbum; will copy the images for you.
Between you and me,. kim files are really just zip files. Normally it is not worth bothering compressing the files because images normally are compressed JPEG already, and the XML file itself are really tiny. If you really want to squish out the last few bytes, you may still do so, by checking Compress Export File
The final option on the page is Limit maximum image dimension. When sending some images to some friends, you may not want to send images in full size, as the. kim file might be huge. For this, you may specify that the maximum dimension of images should be say maximum 800 pixels in each direction.
When you select a. kim file from a web browser, or choose File Import..., & kphotoalbum; will import the database exported with the functionality described in.
The import wizard consist of four steps. First you must specify which images you want to import. Next you must specify in which directory to put the imported images.
Chances are that you call the people category personen (if you are German), while I in Danish might call this category personer. In the third step of the import dialog, you must specify which category from the import file to import, plus which categories in your database they match.
I might call myself in my databases for me, while in your database I'm called Jesper K. Pedersen. Step four let you set up matching for each of the imported categories. This can be see in.
It must be easy to browse and View the images. When viewing images, your focus often changes - one moment you are looking at images from your holiday in 1992, and when seeing an image of a friend whom you spent that holiday with, you focus suddenly changes, so you want to see all images of that friend.
In this manual I will take you through the steps of (1) annotating your images, (2) browsing and viewing images and (3) advanced topics and customization.
KPhotoAlbum started out as an application for managing your images, but since then it has been extended, so it today also takes care of your videos. In many places in this manual I will talk about images, but just as often the discussion does include videos.
& kphotoalbum; will save all its information in the file index. xml in your topmost image directory. This file is a simple XML file, so you can easily back it up using whatever tools you prefer, including normal backup utilities, copying the file to a floppy disk, or keeping revisions using CVS.
& kphotoalbum; will remember where you told it your images were located, and reuse that in future use of & kphotoalbum;. Should you ever want to load another database into & kphotoalbum; (i. e. another directory tree of images), then you may start it with the -c option. For example: kphotoalbum -c ~/ CompanyImages/ index. xml.
Selecting Settings Configure KPhotoAlbum... from the menu bar will bring up the options dialog. This chapter will tell you about the configuration option available there.
Below you may see the configuration page for general options, options for thumbnail view, and options for the viewer. Each options has a very details whats this description, so to get help on these items, simply press F1 and press the cursor on the option in general.
In it was described how you could specify different properties for each image, these included People, Places and Keywords. It is possible to specify your own categories, so if you prefer you could get an Items, a Animals, or a Albums category your self.
In below you can see the dialog used to configure which categories exists. For each category you specify a label and an icon.
In we discussed sub categories. From the settings dialog, it is possible to configure entire member groups, i. e. configure all members of a group in one go rather than configure all groups for a member as was the situation in.
In you can see the configuration page for specifying member groups. At the top there is a combo box, where you can specify which category you are currently configuring. On the left side you see a list box with the current category, and on the right side you see a list box with the sub categories.
& kphotoalbum; shares a plugin system with a number of other image applications, among these digiKam and Gwenview. The plugin system is named Kipi, which is short for & kde; Image Plugin Interface. See Kipi Homepage
The plugins are available from the menu bar, under the item Plugins. The plugins will and can not be described in this manual, as the plugins are not part of & kphotoalbum;, but shipped separately. Most plugins do, however have a help page available from the plugin itself.
As the plugins are shared between a number of applications, certain plugins might be very little tested with & kphotoalbum;, you should therefore always try out new plugins with the demo database before you try them on your own images You start & kphotoalbum; with the demo setup either from the shell by executing kphotoalbum -demo, or from the Help menu. (Do n't say I did n't warn you!).
The applications using KIPI are very different from each other, this means that some plugins are not always working the & kphotoalbum; way, but after all, this is the price for sharing the functionality between the applications.
The most important difference between & kphotoalbum; and the other applications using KIPI, is that the other applications order the images in albums, where an album simply is a directory. & kphotoalbum; do not have this concept; nevertheless, for certain plugins to function, & kphotoalbum; behaves towards the plugin system as if it did.
& kphotoalbum; does this by defining the current album to be the current view - that is, all the images the browser currently offers to display.
In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; must also be able to give a list of all albums; & kphotoalbum; defines this list in the following way:
When & kphotoalbum; 's browser displays the content of a category, say people, then each item in this category will look like an album to the plugin.
Otherwise, the category you specify for Category for virtual albums in the options dialog, will be used; e. g. if you specify People with this option, then & kphotoalbum; will act as if you had just chosen to display people and then invoke the plugin which needs to know about all albums.
Some plugins might be redundant to features implemented in & kphotoalbum;, and in that case you may not want to see them at all in the Plugin menu. For that, you may go to the options dialog, and specify which plugins should be shown at all.
In you can see an example of the window that will greet you once you have started & kphotoalbum; with your own images.
At the top of the screen you will find a menu and toolbar, as you know from any KDE application. Below the toolbar you see the browser window. Currently this is not containing much information, as you have not yet specified any information about your images. In we will get back to the browser, but for now, simply press the View Images item, which will show you an overview of all your images.
The key feature of & kphotoalbum; is that you can annotate your images. This includes who is on a given image, where is it taken, etc. You can do this either an image at a time, or you can annotate a number of images simultaneously (For example, all these images contain the person Jesper, and is taken in Copenhagen.)
All these annotations may be used for searching and browsing, as we will see in. On request you may see these annotations when viewing the items in the build-in viewer.
In there are three list boxes combined with a line edits for specifying people, places and keywords. These widget are a very important part of & kphotoalbum;, as you will use them over and over again, when specifying information about your images.
The idea behind moving items to the top when they have been selected is, that when going to, say a family party, you will get perhaps 50 images all with the same 5-10 people. When typing in information about these 50 images you will have the 5-10 people at the top of the listbox as soon as you have typed in their name the first time.
If you prefer to have the list alphabetically sorted instead, simply press the icon for sorting under the list box.
When you specify properties for one image at a time, you may still of course select a number of images, and say, I want to annotate these images. In this situation, you will find a next and previous button under the image in the topmost rightmost corner.
If you have several images with, say the same person, then it might be more convenient to select those images, and specify that this person is on all images using the Annotate Multiple Items at a Time.
Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and California are all located in USA. Furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.
In you can see a browser window, containing USA as a super category. To indicate to you that this is a group, a special icon is used.
In the context menu for the annotation dialog it is possible to add an item to an existing or new super or sub category. In addition you may simply drag an item to a category to make it a sub category of that item. Notice this requires that you are currently sorting your categories alphabetically. See.
It is possible to move the items of the annotation dialog around, simply from the bar at the top of the frames, and move them around - you can even make a frame into a top level window on its own.
Once you have found a layout that matches your screen layout, your usage of & kphotoalbum;, etc, simply press the Options... button, that will display a popup menu from which you can save the current window layout.
You may also choose to hide away a frame. If you later want to include that frame in your layout, then choose the Options... button, and from there the Show/ Hide windows item. This can be see in.
Selecting View Thumbnails in the browser, you get to a thumbnail overview of the images currently in scope (or all images if no scope have been selected). An example of this can be seen in below. The size of the thumbnails can be configure simply by dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button down (try it is really cool).
Dragging an image from the viewer to the background will set the image as the background image of your desktop.
By clicking on an image you load it into the viewer, if no viewer window is present, a viewer window will be created.
From the thumbnail view it is also possible to delete images. To do so select the images you want to delete and press the delete key or select Edit Delete Selected from the menu bar. Doing so & kphotoalbum; will show you the dialog in
& kphotoalbum; offers a solution to that problem, namely that it allows you to use it, without having the images available on disk. You do of course need to have them available at some point in time for & kphotoalbum; to realize that there are new images for it to index. shows & kphotoalbum; when it is not capable of finding all needed images on the disk.
Images which has the corner cut of (that is image 1-9) are not available on disk. Thumbnails are, however, available for images 5-9, therefore & kphotoalbum; can show you the thumbnails for these images. You can, however, still not display these images in the viewer.
As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files in and out of your directories, & kphotoalbum; does not have any support for asking you to insert the CD you labeled blah blah. Thus please forget about this feature if you are the kind of person who do not like messing with files etc, and instead simply ensure to buy hard disks that is large enough to always store all your images.
In the Images menu you will find a sub menu called privacy. To get some privacy, browse - while you are on your own - to the images that you want to keep private, and select Lock Away Current Set of Images from the privacy sub menu. Alternatively you may browse to the images you want to limit your little sister to see, and select Lock Away All Other Images.
Now you have specified what to hide away, and once you hand over your laptop to your little sister, simply choose Lock Images, and your sister will not be able to see the locked images. When done you may unlock them again using Unlock.
It is possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the database. In the privacy menu, simply select Change Password to set a password.
Do n't get fooled to believe that this will help you hide away images for good. First the images are still on the disk, second, anyone with access to the index. xml file that & kphotoalbum; uses can read the password in clear text and optionally delete it. This feature is only meant as a protection against someone sitting with & kphotoalbum; unintentionally getting to your private images.
The reason for you to put all your images into & kphotoalbum;, and spending hours after hours describing them, is of course that you at some point want to look at them. For that purpose & kphotoalbum; has an viewer capable of showing your images and videos. You open the viewer from the thumbnail view as described in.
The viewer can be seen in. The viewer does of course show you the image, but in addition to that it also shows you the information you specified for each image, including, who is on the images, where and when it was takes etc.
In case the info box is located on top of part of the images you actually want to see, you can simply grab it with the mouse, and move it elsewhere on the image. It is possible to configure what should be shown in the info box, and of course whether it should be shown at all. All these options are available by right clicking your mouse on the viewer. The context menu can be seen in below.
Some of the words in the info box is underlines. If you click the mouse on one of these words the browser (see) will go into scope of that item. Thus if you click on Anne Helene the browser will show you all images of Anne Helene, just as it would have done if you selected People from the root of the browser, and next selected Anne Helene.
In case you have loaded several images into the viewer, you can go forth and back using Page Up and Page Down. You can go to the first and last images using Home and End. These functions are of course also available from the context menu.
If several images was loaded into the viewer, you can ask it to run them as a slide show, which means that & kphotoalbum; loads a new image every few second. How often it loads a new image is configure by pressing the control key and respective plus (for go faster) or minus (go slower). Starting and stopping the slide show is done simply by pressing Ctrl; S.
A very useful feature of the & kphotoalbum; viewer is it ability to go into full screen mode. In this mode, the viewer is using the complete screen space, simply press the return key to make it go into and out of full screen mode.
Using the viewer, you may zoom in and out of your image, simply by dragging out a rectangle with the mouse. Pressing the minus key will zoom out again. Pressing the plus key will zoom in at the center of the image. below shows how a zoom rectangle is marked, and shows the result of the zoom.
Pressing the period key, lets you reset zooming, so the image is shown unzoomed. Pressing the equal sign will set the zoom level so each pixel on the screen correspond to a pixel in the image.
Notice, for technical the only zooming operation that works when watching videos are zoom in and out (the plus and minus key).
Choosing the rotate operations from the context menu, you may rotate the image (Does not work for videos). You can annotate the current image, simply by choosing Annotate in the context menu.
When viewing the images you may find that a given image contains a person whose name you forgot to set on the images. At this time you may cancel your viewing, and rush to the image config dialog to specify the person. However, you may prefer to just tag the image and continue on viewing images.
An alternative situation is if you want to sent a number of images to a printer to get them developed on paper. To see which you want, you start the viewer on the images, and tag them as good or bad while by inspecting see each one.
For the above two examples the viewer offers you to set tokens on the images when viewing them. Tokens are named from A to Z, and you set a token simply by pressing its letter. In you may see an image where the tokens A, B and C are set.
Once you've set tokens on your images, they will be available for regular browsing in the browser, as can be seen in. So when you've marked images that needs to be edited, printed, or whatever, simply browse to the images, and annotate all images at a time (as described in), use a plugin to copy the selected images to a CD, or whatever you need to do.
Categories (and esp tokens) may be displayed in the thumbnail viewer. When Showing the categories in the thumbnail viewer, you may also add tokens to images, simply by pressing the letter for the token when the image is selected, this can be seen in
Sometimes it might not be obvious what you want to show with a given image, for that purpose & kphotoalbum; allows you to draw on the images.
The actual drawing is not saved to the image, but rather to the database, that way you can undo your drawing at a later point.
In you can see an image drawn on. To bring & kphotoalbum; in to drawing mode, select Draw on Image from the context menu. To quit drawing, press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.
While it is not necessary to fully understand the & Povray; application in order to make good use of & kpovmodeler;, it is highly recommended that you read and try to understand the & Povray; documentation.
In the object tree you can select objects. Once you select an object, its attributes are displayed in the properties view and rendered yellow in the wireframe views.
You can select multiple objects. However, you cannot select a child of an already selected object, because all children are selected indirectly with the parent.
To add a new object to the object tree, select the object where you want to insert the new object and either click the icon in the toolbar or choose a menu entry in the Insert menu.
If there is more than one position possible, the following popup menu prompts you to select the correct position:
To remove objects, select them and select Delete from either the Edit menu or the & RMB; context menu.
If you changed some properties, click the Apply button to make the changes permanent. If you entered invalid data, a message box will show up with an error description. You can then adjust the properties and press Apply again, or revert your changes with the Cancel button.
If you set the path to your & Povray; user documentation in the settings dialog, you can open the & Povray; reference page for the displayed object with the Help button.
You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HTML user documentation in order to use this feature. If your distribution does not contain this documentation you can download it here. The & Povray; 3.5 package contains the html user documentation.
If you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can preview it inside the properties view.
Press the Preview button inside the properties view and a small sample scene with the selected texture will be rendered. By default the whole texture will be rendered, even if not the top item is selected. If you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map), check the local check box.
The above screenshot shows the control points of the camera. You can drag the control points around to change the camera's position and direction.
If a transformation is selected, the control points are removed and a small cross is displayed in the wireframe view. The cross marks the center for scaling and rotation, as well as the position for translations. You can change the transformation with the mouse by dragging inside the whole view.
Each object with a wire frame has a visibility level. You can specify a visibility level relative to the parent's visibility level or an absolute value. Objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal the chosen scene visibility level in the toolbar.
& kpovmodeler; comes with a default view layout: The object tree and the object properties view to the left and four graphical views to the right.
If you do n't like the default layout, or need another layout, you can freely configure it. You can even save multiple view layouts and switch between them on the fly.
To dock a widget above or below an existing view, drag the handle to the top or bottom of a view. A rectangle will indicate the new position.
To create a new column, drag the handle to the right or left side of another view. The view will then dock to the left or right side of the view and span the full height.
If you want multiple views sharing the same space, drag the handle to the center of another view. You can then switch between the views by clicking the corresponding tab on top of the views.
The last layout possibility are floating views: views that are not docked into the main view. To undock a view, drag the handle to the desktop or press the little arrow in the view handle that points to the top left side.
To close a view, click the little cross in the handle. To prevent closing, click the little box between the arrow and the cross.
You can add additional views to the main window. The View menu contains entries for each type of view. New views will be created floating, which you can dock wherever you like.
You can save the current view layout with View Save View Layout... A dialog opens that lets you select an existing layout or create a new one.
Once you have created a scene, you will want to render it. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g to render the scene, so you need a correct installation of & Povray;. At the time of writing & Povray; 3.5 was released. This version is not supported in the & kpovmodeler; 1.0 version.
To render the current scene, press the render icon The render icon in the toolbar, or select the View Render menu entry.
A render mode is similar to & Povray; s ini file entries. It specifies the image size and quality levels for rendering. If you would like to render your scene with different qualities and sizes, you can add as many render modes as you need, from quick previews to fullscreen high quality images.
When you press the render settings icon The render settings in the toolbar or select the View Render Modes... menu icon, the following dialog opens:
Each render mode has a description. You can enter any description, but it should reflect the render mode's properties.
In the Size tab you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. If you want to render only a small part of the image, check the Subselection check box and enter the part of the image in the fields below.
In the Quality combo box you can select the features & Povray; uses while rendering. The possibilities range from a very simple coloring and lighting model, to one which has complex diffuse inter-reflection lighting. See the & Povray; user documentation for a detailed description of the rendering features.
If an image is rendered with only one sample per pixel, various errors can occur. These images often have moireacute; or stepped effects in curves and lines, and details can get lost if they are smaller in appearance then one pixel. This effect is called aliasing.
& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. In general images will look smoother with this feature.
If you enable anti-aliasing, & Povray; will calculate and combine more then one sample per pixel. This is called super-sampling.
& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. The default is an adaptive non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling depends on the local neighborhood of the pixel. Not every pixel is super-sampled with this method. The second method is an adaptive recursive one; recursive because every pixel is divided and sub-divided recursively, and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the computed color values.
When you select the first method, povray traces one ray per pixel. If the difference between its color value and that of its neighbor exceeds the given threshold, both pixels are super-sampled by tracing a fixed number of additional rays. If you set the depth value to 4, a 4x4 grid of additional points will be calculated, a depth value of 5 will result in 5x5 (25) samples per pixel.
The difference between two pixels is computed as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the red, green and blue values of the first pixel; r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the red, green and blue values of the second pixel. The difference is then:
diff = abs(r 1 -r 2) + abs(g 1 -g 2) + abs(b 1 -b 2)
The recursive method starts with 4 samples per pixel. If the resulting color values differ more than the given threshold, the pixel is sub-divided into 4 sub pixels that are separately traced and tested for further subdivision. You can specify the maximum recursive depth with the depth value.
An additional method to reduce aliasing effects is to add noise to the sampling process, called jittering. If you enable jittering, & Povray; jitters the samples a tiny amount to reduce regular patterns.
The last quality setting is radiosity. Radiosity is an experimental & Povray; feature that computes inter-diffuse light reflection. Be patient when rendering a scene with this feature.
In the last tab, you can configure whether or not the alpha channel should be calculated by povray. A pixel will then be transparent if the corresponding ray did not hit a single object.
Opens another window that displays the & Povray; console output. If & Povray; exits abnormally, you can find the reason in that window.
To import a & Povray; scene select the File Import Povray... menu item and choose a file in the file open dialog.
Not the full & Povray; syntax is supported by & kpovmodeler; at the moment. If there are errors or warnings during importing, a dialog will show up that lists all messages.
If you want to import unsupported code to & kpovmodeler;, put the source between the two special comments / /*PMRawBegin and / /*PMRawEnd.
You can drag objects from the object tree to an editor to export & Povray; code. This will insert the objects code into the current text file in the editor. To import objects into the scene, simply select the code in your editor and drag it on to the object tree.
You can use the copy and paste functionality of & kpovmodeler; and your editor to exchange & Povray; code as well.
The povray command is called when & kpovmodeler; renders a scene. Common commands are povray or x-povray.
If you press the Help button in the properties view, & kpovmodeler; opens the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. Set here the path to your documentation and your documentation version. Supported versions are 3.1g and 3.5.
& Povray; searches for external files (height field data as example) in the & Povray; library paths. If you refer to files not in the scene's folder, you have to add the folder to the list. If a file exists in multiple library paths, that one in the first path is used.
The colors for wire frames. The second color is used if the object is selected.
The color for control points. The second color is used if the control point is selected.
The color for the field of view rectangle in the camera view and the view type labels.
You can snap control points to the grid with the context menu in the wireframe views. You can configure the grid for translations, scales and rotations separately here.
Higher values lead to a finer wireframe and therefore to a better approximation for the displayed objects, but slow down rendering. For some objects like the sphere you can configure the detail level for two directions separately.
If you check the High detail for enhanced projections check box, all wire frame lines are subdivided further if the camera uses an enhanced projection. Enhanced projections are all projections except the perspective and orthographic projections. This feature greatly improves the approximation of these projections but slows down rendering.
If the Enable wall check box is checked, a wall will be rendered behind the objects. The wall is textured with a checker pattern with the two configurable colors.
If the Enable floor check box is checked, a floor will be rendered below the objects. The floor is textured with a checker pattern with the two configurable colors.
If the Enable antialiasing check box is checked, the non-recursive antialiasing method will be used for rendering the scene. You can configure the depth and threshold values. See render modes section for a detailed description of the parameters.
In this page you can fine-tune existing view layouts or manually create new ones. See section View Layouts how to create and save view layouts.
The combo box Default view layout: lists all available view layouts. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected view layout at program start.
The list Available View Layouts shows all available view layouts. You can add a new layout with the Add button and remove the selected layout with the Remove button.
Each view layout is identified by its name. The name has to be unique and must not be empty.
The list below the name displays all views for the selected view layout. You can add new views with the Add button and remove the selected view with the Remove button.
The position of the view. New Column will create a new column to the right side of the previous views, Below will dock the view below the previous view, Tabbed will create a tabbed view together with the previous one and Floating will not dock the view into the main window but create a separate window.
OK, that's it. You have just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler;, and now you already want to start without much knowledge of any of the two softwares. Here we go now: If you follow the steps of this tutorial, you'll be able to set the ultimate simple scene, very widespread among the newbies: A sphere over a plane.
But you should carefully consider the following warnings before complaining if all you get is a black screen. If this is the very first time you use a 3D software, you should be aware of these golden rules:
If you set no camera, no rules apply to the render engine which ca n't render a proper picture, ending in a black picture.
If you set no light system, all your scene is in the dark, ending in a black picture.
If you got everything installed fine, once & kpovmodeler; is loaded, you discover the following default windows setting:
Take a few minutes to explore the menus and icons available. If you have time, please read the documentation in order to get a fair idea of what you can expect from this piece of software.
You will have to use each of them intensively from now on, so always keep them and their use in mind.
& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. In order to follow this tutorial you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. Select the scene and choose the Edit Delete menu entry. You should now have an empty scene.
The wireframe view shows how the camera is set regarding the whole scene we are creating. In particular, we can now see something in the fourth wire frame view (right, bottom): This is the view of the scene from the camera point of view. This is what will be seen when you render the scene.
The object tree now shows a new entry, reading camera. If you click on it, it affects the content of the object properties view, where various parameters pertaining to the camera can be found. Referring to the & Povray; 's documentation to learn more about these could be helpful.
We will change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this will be the scope of later tutorials, but please note that in the graphic view, the camera has control points that let you control the point to which the camera points. You just have to left-click on one handle and move it to an appropriate location.
Once you press the Apply button (or hit Enter), the wire frame view and the object tree immediately change in order to comply to these settings, and here is what now should see the camera.
There are many ways to create a ground for our scene. One method could have been to insert a box object (Insert Finite Solid Primitives Box) and resize x to 100, y to 0 and z to 100, for example, but it's a cumbersome way to do this task.
In fact, & kpovmodeler; offers you a convenient feature: You can create a infinite plane that will feature the ground:
Take a good custom: Having the plane selected in the object tree, please change its name in something that is convenient to you and then press the Apply button (or hit Enter). The object tree will update the name of the entry.
The wire frame view also shows the plane now, even if it looks finite by now. But do n't worry, it will spread up to the horizon line when you'll render the scene!
If you pay attention to the object tree, you will notice that the ground entry can be expanded if you click on the plus icon standing just before the object. Once done, you see various settings parented to the object. In this case, there is n't much yet, apart from the standard options to any newly created object: Scale, rotate, and translate. Selecting each of these will change the settings available in the object properties view.
In this scene, we will arbitrary translate the ground one unit lower than the horizon line, just for you to tweak some of these parameters. Select translate, and adjust the parameters as follow:
Please select the ground prior to adding any material properties to it. Many possibilities await us, but we will stay close to something quite easy for now.
In both cases, a popup window will prompt you to choose the way the object should be inserted. Please choose First Child. The pigment now appears in the object tree. You can change its name in the properties view (Name = Ground Pigment), and click on the Preview button in order to see how the pigment looks like for now.
Of course, the preview of the pigment shows nothing but a black matte material, because we need to refine the pigment settings. Anyway, keep in mind you always can preview the look and feel of your materials using the Preview button. We will now define the pigment colors. Again, many possibilities await us, but we will choose one of the most straightforward for now.
If no color shows on the box and the sphere of the preview, click on the Apply button before calling for a preview.
The ground material has been successfully set! If you render your picture now, using the render icon, you should get the following result:
Of course, these colors are not the ones you could have expected. We still have to see how we can customize them. In the case of the color list, you have to define two new sets of attributes, called Solid Color. In the Object Tree, make sure the color list entry is selected. Then go through this two times (you ca n't do it more, anyway, as the checkers color list can only afford the use of two solid colors):
One after another, in the object tree, select the two solid colors and change their color attributes in the object properties view:
For this step, we should already be at ease, because we begin to understand & kpovmodeler; 's general behavior. In the object tree, select the scene entry. Creating the sphere is as easy as creating the ground:
The object properties view offers you immediately to change its settings, which we'll do right now. By setting the Radius value to 1 (do n't forget to hit Enter or press Apply), we make sure that the sphere will be in contact with the ground. Otherwise, since we moved the ground one unit bottom, the sphere will look like floating above the ground.
Of course, a rendering now will give a strange result: As already seen before, the sphere appears with a black matte material. We will set a proper material in the following step.
With the sphere selected, you can now set a material for it. As we already did for the ground, let's give to the sphere a pigment color:
Select First Child and rename to Sphere pigment, for example. With the sphere pigment entry selected, insert a solid color and set the parameters as follow:
But there are more interesting effects to achieve if we take time to set some finish attributes:
Then change the values according to the following snapshot and press Apply or hit Enter.
The Specular and Reflection parameters give particularly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-like effects, even if Metallic has n't been chosen at this step:
You should now have a fair glimpse of what is possible with kpovmodeler. Hopefully, you are already skilled enough to do simple but beautiful things.
Raytracing is a method of rendering, that is, creating a 2D image out of a 3D scene or model.
When raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots a hypothetical ray from the perspective of the viewer (that is, from the camera you are rendering the scene from) through each pixel in the scene. It calculates how this ray reflects and refracts from objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect it. The scene is built up, pixel by pixel.
As you may imagine, without a camera, you cannot see anything - the camera is your eye into the scene. Furthermore, without any light, you still wo n't see anything - it would just be dark. Obviously, any scene intended for raytracing must include some light, an object of some kind and at least one camera.
A normal file dialog will open, allowing you to choose your file. Povray files usually have the extensions *. pov or *. inc.
Open a file. The standard file dialog will allow you to choose a file you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;
Whenever you open or create a new model, it is added to this submenu, replacing the oldest entry in the list.
If you have already saved this model, it will be saved with the same name. If it is a new file, you will be asked to name it and choose a location to save it.
Revert the scene to the state it was in the last time you saved it. Changes you have made since the last save will be lost.
This menu item is not available unless you have unsaved changes to the current scene.
Redo the last action you undid. This menu item is not available unless you have used Edit Undo.
Save the current view layout. A dialog opens to choose a name for a new layout or to overwrite an existing one.
This menu provides options for configuring & kpovmodeler;, changing its appearance, shortcuts and standard behavior.
Opens a dialog for changing the key bindings. Using this option you can change the standard key shortcut for & kpovmodeler; 's commands or create new ones.
Opens a dialog for configuring the toolbar. You can add and remove toolbuttons for & kpovmodeler; 's commands with this option.
A bump map is a way to simulate a rough surface, without having to model every single bump on the surface, and without changing the underlying geometric shape of the object itself.
It is common to use the same file as both a bump map and a texture map.
Primitives are the basic geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks. Most complex 3d models are created from many dozens, or even hundreds, of these primitives, which are then edited and manipulated to give a more realistic appearance.
A texture map is a way of applying color to the surface of an object on a pixel by pixel basis, by applying an image file as a color map.
& kuickshow; is a comfortable image browser/ viewer. It displays a filebrowser where you can select images which are then shown.
Images can be displayed either in their own window, as large as the image, or fullscreen.
Using & kuickshow; is very simple. The file browser lists files, which you can select with a & LMB; click or the Return key.
You can configure whether images should show up in their own window, or always use the same window.
If you are looking for a certain file, just enter the first few characters of its filename in the browser. A small edit window will pop up in the bottom right corner. When a matching file is found, it is highlighted. You can leave the edit window by pressing Return or & Esc;.
The kuickshow; Configuration dialog contains 5 tabs. Three of them, General, Modifications and Slideshow configure the operation of & kuickshow;, and the other two, Viewer Shortcuts and Browser Shortcuts allow you to personalize the shortcuts for the respective windows.
If this is selected, images open in full screen mode. If the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the screen is filled with the background color selected below. The default is off.
If this is selected, & kuickshow; will load the next image in the folder, while you are looking at the current one. This reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is especially useful for slide shows.
If this is selected, & kuickshow; saves the name of the last folder on exit. On next start & kuickshow; will open this folder in the browser window.
Click on the colored bar to select a background color. This is used to fill the screen in fullscreen mode, or the window, if you have resized it larger than the image.
You can configure & kuickshow; to only show you some of the file types it is capable of.
If this is selected, large images are displayed in maximized window. The default is on.
Indicates if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the image which is selected.
The length of time between image changes during the slideshow. You can use the slider, type a new value into the field, or use the small arrows to increase or decrease the value. The default is 3 seconds.
The amount of iterations. If set to 0 it will loop until you abort the slideshow. You can use the slider, type a new value into the field, or use the small arrows to increase or decrease the value. The default is 1.
Change the shortcuts for the different modes of & kuickshow; in the Viewer Shortcuts and the Browser Shortcuts tabs.
Use this option to toggle between a 2 pane view of the file system (one pane for the folders and one pane for the files) and a one pane view of the file system with folders and files.
Display the image files in the folder with large icons. This item is only available in Short View mode.
Display the image files in the folder with small icons. This item is only available in Short View mode.
Display a preview of the images in the folder. This item is only available in Short View mode.
Reduces the image size by ten percent. Again this refers to the current size of the image.
Enlarges the image by ten percent. Notice that this refers to the current size of the picture.
Closes the image window. This will close & kuickshow; entirely, if you do n't have a browser window open.
Shows the image in original size. This is only useful when you have enabled automatic scaling.
Opens the edit field used for completion. Enter the first characters of a filename to search for, and if found, the file will be selected.
& showfoto; is a & kde; stand alone Photo Editor based on & digikam; Image Editor. & showfoto; is a part of & digikam; project.
& showfoto; is a fast Image Editor with powerful image editing tools. You can use it to view your photographs and improve them.
Like the rest of & kde;, & showfoto; is an Open Source project. This means that it relies on its users to play their part by, at least, reporting problems and suggesting possible improvements.
& showfoto; makes it as easy as possible for you to report bugs or suggest improvements. Wherever you are in the application the Help menu will include a Report Bugs option. This will display a message box with a highlighted link. Click on the link and your web browser will open the page for the reporting system. All the information required will already be filled in, just follow the instructions for completing your report.
& showfoto; is a community supported project, which means that users and developers support one another. If you become a regular user of & showfoto; you are encouraged to join the & showfoto; Users Mailing List. You can start off by asking questions of other & showfoto; users and hopefully soon you will be answering the support questions of others.
The best way to start getting involved with & showfoto; is to join the Developers Mailing List. showfoto; Developer Mailing List joining instructions.
& showfoto; tries to give you as much control on how it works as possible. There are many options that change the behavior of & showfoto;. To access these settings select Setting Configure & showfoto; from the Menu Bar. The configuration dialog is separated into eight pages. You can change between these pages by clicking on the icons on the left-hand side of the dialog.
The Exposure Indicators lets one choose the color to use when the under- respectively over-exposure indicators are selected. Preferentially the colors should be contrasting with what they indicate, that is, under-exposure should have a light color and over-exposure areas should show dark colors.
The & showfoto; main window has a sidebar at the right border providing important information and actions of the selected images. This same sidebar is also available in the Image Editor view. It can be displayed by respectively clicking on one of the five tabs:
& skanlite; is an image scanning application that does nothing more than scan and save images.
& skanlite; is a simple image scanning application that does nothing more than scan and save images. & skanlite; can open a save dialog for every image scanned or save the images immediately in a specified directory with auto-generated names and format. The user can also choose to show the scanned image before saving.
You can check the status of your scanner support from the SANE project website by entering the information on this search page: http: / /www. sane-project. org/ cgi-bin/ driver. pl.
A default scanner can be specified on the command line of & skanlite; using skanlite -d [device name] in a terminal. If the selected scanner cannot be opened or if no default scanner is provided, a scanner selection dialog is opened.
The user can choose the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner. Pressing Cancel will cause & skanlite; to exit.
The other options contains more detailed options of the backends. & skanlite; (libksane) does not have any special handling for these options.
To scan an image, the user can start with a preview scan and then select the part of the scan area to do the final scan on. The preview scan is started by pressing the preview button.
To better select the image the user can zoom in, out, to the current selection or zoom to fit the whole preview to the window.
When the image is selected the final image can be acquired by pressing the final scan button.
If Preview image before saving is selected in the settings, the scanned image is displayed in a preview window as you can see below on the screenshot. If Save is pressed, the image is saved and if Close is pressed the preview is discarded and you return to the main window.
By clicking the Settings button, the settings dialog is brought up before the main window. You can choose the most important settings here.
The user can chose to preview the image before saving. In this case the Preview the image before saving option can be left checked. If the user does not want to preview the image this option should then be unchecked.
This setting allows you to choose how & skanlite; will save the images. If you choose Open the save dialog for every image then the save dialog will be opened for every scanned image. If you prefer & skanlite; to auto-save (by auto-generating a name and saving the image in a predefined directory) then you can choose Save without asking for a filename.
This setting defines where the images should be saved when Save without asking for a filename is chosen in the previous option. If the save dialog is to be opened for every image the default save location for the dialog will be the same as this parameter. The default save location is your home directory and you can change this location by clicking on the... button.
This parameter defines the image prefix for the auto-saved images and is also the suggested name for the image in the save dialog. The auto-saved image will have a numeric suffix (the ### will be replaced by numbers) that is increased every time an image is saved.
The user can chose to specify the image quality to be used for saving the images. The image quality setting affects the compression level used for saving. If Specify image save quality is not checked, the quality is the default value chosen by Qt.
The Help button brings up the KDE Help center with the & skanlite; manual. The About button brings up the KDE About dialog for & skanlite;. The Settings button displays the settings dialog and the Close button is used to exit & skanlite;.
& skanlite; is licensed under the GPL and the libksane library, used by & skanlite;, is licensed under the LGPL. Note: libsane is licensed under GPL with an exception.
& amarok; uses keyboard shortcuts like most other applications, below is a listing of those shortcuts and there respective actions. The global shortcuts can be configured by right clicking the Player window and selecting Configure Global Shortcuts... The & amarok; shortcuts can be configured by right clicking the Player window and selecting Configure Shortcuts...
You can assign you multimedia keys to work as & amarok; shortcuts making your keyboard an & amarok; control center.
The DCOP interface for Amarok has many generic calls that may be found in other KDE applications. This section is divided into six tables and is intended to describe the DCOP calls of the collection, contextbrowser, player, playlist, playlistbrowser and scripts. An example of the pause dcop call would look like:
Amarok supports the use of the standard Qt and kde command line options. Amarok also has it's own application specific options.
In order to provide some feedback when a script fails to run due to a missing dependency, please check in your script if the module you want to include really exists. If the dependency is missing, you should catch the error and show an information dialog using the "kdialog" command line tool, so that the user learns why the script fails to run.
begin require'Korundum 'rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' ` kdialog --sorry '#{error} '` exit end
& amarok; provides template scripts for several languages in the scripts/ templates/ directory. You can use these scripts as a basis for your own scripts, and extend them with the functionality you need. You'll notice that scripting is actually quite straightforward; For instance if you know to program a bit in Python, making your own script wo n't take you long.
Scripts can control Amarok by calling some of its DCOP functions. The easiest way to invoke a DCOP function is by using the "dcop" command line utility, which is part of every KDE distribution.
Most scripting languages allow to execute external programs, with a function like exec(). This way the "dcop" utility can be invoked easily. Here is a simple Python example:
& amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts by writing strings to their stdin channel. The script should therefore constantly monitor stdin, and react accordingly to each of the possible events. Scripts may also choose to ignore any event they do n't have a use for.
configure Tells the script to show its configuration dialog. The script must handle the storing and loading of configuration options by itself. When a script is started, Amarok sets its working directory to the folder where all data should be stored.
trackChange Signals the start of a new track. The script may then use DCOP functions to query further information about the track, e. g. metadata and the length.
volumeChange newVolume Signals a change of the master volume level. The volume is an integer with a range of 0-100.
customMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Returns the paths to selected files in the playlist when the custom playlist context menu item is clicked. The submenu and itemTitle are also returned for identification purposes in case a script is listening for multiple notifications. To insert an item into the context menu use the DCOP call'dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem( submenu itemTitle) '. To remove an item from the context menu use the DCOP call'dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem( submenu itemTitle)'.
Before & amarok; exits, or when the user stops a script with the Script Manager, & amarok; sends the SIGTERM signal to the script. This signal can be caught in order to do cleanup work, like saving data or configuration settings.
& amarok; 's Script Manager is able to install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. Packages are just normal tarballs (. tar), optionally compressed with bzip2 (. bz2). We strongly recommend using a filename like myscript. amarokscript. tar. bz2, so the user can easily identify the package as an Amarok script.
& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the amarokscript extension, so it is better to use it right from the start.
The main script must have executable (+x) permissions set, while additional modules which the script loads should not be executable. To preserve the file permissions in the tarball, you should use tar with the -p flag:
When the package is finished, you can upload it to www. kde-apps. org, and add the link to the & amarok; Wiki Scripts Page. For the kde-apps entry you should use the amarok; Scripts category.
& amarok; is an audio player for & kde; that is extremely powerful, yet surprisingly simple to use.
With & amarok; you can simply drag and drop music into the playlist instead of searching through endless menus. Just looking for that one song in a huge collection? & amarok; 's collection browser with its quick-search bar will help you find it in a matter of seconds.
Do you already have many different playlists but can never decide on which one you want to use? Then the playlist browser is just for you. Never know what to listen to? Amarok's Dynamic Mode will choose your music for you, and Smart Playlists allow you to jump right in to specific parts of your collection.
Amarok has outstanding support for Apple's iPod, iRiver's ifp and a multitude of generic USB devices. It also features many different audio backends allowing YOU to choose how you listen to your music. These and other features make it the most advanced audio player available. & amarok; is smart, sexy and clever. We hope that its use will truly allow you to "Rediscover your music!"
In order to compile and install Amarok on your system, type the following in the base directory of the Amarok distribution:
Since & amarok; uses autoconf and automake you should have no trouble compiling it. Should you run into problems please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.
& amarok; is like most other apps in that it has several compile time options that can be enabled or disabled during configure. This is a list of the options that can be configured.
Some compile time options require specific dependencies to be used. See the requirements section for more details.
Enables debug symbols. Choose from yes, no, and full. Please use the full option if you intend to help with & amarok; development.
& amarok; is easily configured from the configuration dialog. The configuration dialog has multiple tabs for setting up different functions of & amarok;.
Show player window (like XMMS): Turns on the XMMS-like Player Window. When un-checked, only the Playlist Window, which resembles a display mode similar to the Juk interface, is shown.
Use Moodbar: only visible when & amarok; is compiled with moodbar support. This turns on the experimental moodbar support.
Make Moodier: only visible when & amarok; is compiled with moodbar support. It changes the color scheme used for the moodbar.
Store Mood data files with music: only visible when & amarok; is compiled with moodbar support. When enabled, this option allows saving of. mood files in the same location as the corresponding audio file. When disabled, the. mood files are saved within the & amarok; settings directory; usually ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ amarok/ moodbar/.
External web browser: allows choosing what & amarok; uses to open external links via a drop-down menu listing the installed browsers.
Use another browser: allows you to specify the location to a browser not listed in the above menu.
Remember current playlist on exit: check this if you want to save your current playlist when you exit & amarok; and reload it the next time.
Manually saved playlists use relative path: check this box to have & amarok; save playlists with the location of audio file with respect to the location of the playlist. When unchecked & amarok; will save the exact location to the audio files in the playlist.
Keep active song visible on track change: this option automatically scrolls the Playlist, when a track changes, to ensure that the currently playing track is always visible.
Switch to Context Browser on track change: used to change to the Context Browser tab if it is n't active when & amarok; starts playback of a new track.
The Appearance tab allows you to configure how & amarok; looks. The tab is divided into three sections.
The fonts section is used for selecting the fonts to be used with & amarok;. Selecting the Use custom fonts checkbox enables font selection buttons. The available choices are for the Player Window, the Playlist Window, and the Context Browser. By clicking the Choose... button you can select a font from the dialog.
Custom color scheme enables color selectors to choose custom foreground and background colors for & amarok;.
Resume playback on start allows resuming playback of the last track that was playing when & amarok; was closed, from the last known position in the track.
The Configure On-Screen-Display tab allows you to activate the On-Screen-Display. If the On-Screen-Display check box is selected an area is activated for configuring the look of the display. When the On-Screen-Display is activated a preview widget will also be displayed allowing you to see the effects of your changes to the look of the On-Screen-Display
The first option for the OSD is the Font. Clicking the Choose button will open a Font Selection dialog allowing you to choose the font used in the OSD. There is also a Draw shadow checkbox to enable or disable the use of Shadowed text in the OSD
The next option is for the OSD colors. Checking the Use custom colors checkbox enables the Text color: and Background color: buttons. Clicking the buttons opens a dialog to choose the color OSD Text or OSD Background. If the Use custom colors checkbox is disabled the OSD will follow your current & kde; color scheme.
The Display Text text input box is used for configuring the text shown in the OSD. By assigning variables you can customize the OSD to suit your needs. Below is a list of the variables and the text they represent.
The Screen option is for xinerama users only. This option is used to determine what screen the OSD will be shown on in a multiple monitor setup.
The Configure Engine tab allows you to select a sound engine from the list in the drop-down menu. Available options vary among the engines selected. See the "Requirements" section for different engines available.
The Collection settings tab is used for configuring all the collection options. These include the folders where you music is stored, and the database used for the collection.
This is where you choose the folders you want & amarok; to scan for music. Simply check the boxes next to the desired folders in the tree view of your filesystem. The Collection Folders section also has several check boxes to specify how the collection uses the selected folders.
Scan folders recursively: tells & amarok; to scan the selected folders and all of their sub-folders.
Watch folders for changes: allows & amarok; to watch the selected folders for filesystem changes (for example, added or deleted music files). An incremental scan is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.
Import Playlists: allows & amarok; to import any playlists (. pls and. m3u files) it finds while scanning for tracks to add to your collection. You will find these on the "Playlists" sidebar.
The Collection Database section is used to select a database to use for the collection. Use the Engine: combo box to select from either Sqlite or MySql. If MySql is selected, additional configuration is required in the MySql Configuration section.
The MySql Configuration section is for configuring what database & amarok; uses, and where it is located. First is the Hostname:, which is where the MySql database is located. Next is the Port:, which is the network port used when connecting to the database. The Name: option, is the actual database to connect to.
Use the Username: and Password: text input boxes to specify the username and password used for connecting to the MySql database.
The last. fm settings tab configures the last. fm support in & amarok;. Tracks played are submitted to the last. fm server, and if asked to, & amarok; will request recommendations based on your currently playing track.
This is where you fill in the Username and Password for your last. fm profile. If you do not have a profile you can register at the last. fm website.
Improve my profile by submitting the tracks I play: allows & amarok; to submit your played tracks to your last. fm profile.
Retrieve similar artists: this will cause & amarok; to request, from last. fm, a list of artists similar to the one you're listening to. These are also displayed in the Context Browser. Note: you do not need a last. fm profile to receive similar artists - simply check this box.
& amarok; is a music player for Unix systems (eg. Linux). More information can be found in a summary of its features and the screenshot gallery.
& amarok; only requires KDElibs, none of the other KDE stuff. So you have to have KDElibs installed properly (including all the binaries that come with it, as & amarok; needs some of these to find plugins and for the script plugins). We have written an entry for how to compile a minimal KDElibs, which you may find useful.
For some features to work correctly, such as the on-screen display, require your window manager to support the relevant freedesktop. org standards. So GNOME will work well, but fluxbox will have some trouble. We are committed to supporting & amarok; on all platforms. We use KDElibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.
It's likely that one file in your Collection triggers a bug in the TagLib library, and makes & amarok; crash. You can identify this file by looking at ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ amarok/ collection_scan. log. You should report this crash to the TagLib bug database on bugs. kde. org and attach the broken file. Afterward you can remove the file from your Collection and repeat the scanning.
This usually means TagLib is crashing while reading that track's tags. Report the bug against TagLib at bugs. kde. org.
If you use MySQL as the database backend, try the SQLite one, it is slightly more mature (the & amarok; code, not the db itself)
Make sure that all the libraries that & amarok; uses were compiled with the same GCC version as & amarok; itself. The situation when & amarok; is compiled using GCC 3.4. x and linked against taglib which was compiled using GCC 3.3. x can lead to crashes during tag editing.
If you're using KDE with artsd, try disabling "auto suspend if idle after..." in the sound system settings or at least do n't use a value of 1 second since that will interfere every time amarok switches songs.
Otherwise, forward us the backtraces when the email pops-up (you'll see). If you get a crash often you will get it fixed for sure if you forward a really good backtrace to us. See the next sections for assistance there.
This is because most applications put utf8 data into id3v2 tags but do not specify the encoding as unicode. This perl script will fix that.
#! /usr/ bin/ perl die "File $ARGV[0] does n't exist" unless -f $ARGV[0]; use MP3: :Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3: :Mplib- > new($ARGV[0]); my $v2tag = $mp3- > get_v2tag; print "Error writing tags of $ARGV[0]\" unless $mp3- > set_v2tag($v2tag, amp; UTF8);
This script requires the perl module MP3: :Mplib which can be installed by issuing this command perl -MCPAN -e'install MP3: :Mplib '
& amarok; statusbar icons(Random/ Repeat/ Append) look constantly Active on KDE 3.4.0. This is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. The icon effects are sometimes forgotten. Simple fix kcontrol Appearance Icons Advanced, set disabled state to "Gray" and "Semi-transparent". Note that sometimes you must click on the icon 3 times before it has an effect after making this change.
if you get this error: "amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap", then check that amarokapp uses the correct libqt (check with: ldd ` which amarokapp ` _BAR_ grep qt).
To fix it, you might have to remove any conflicting libqt and/ or edit / etc/ ld. so. conf so it pick up the correct version first.
There are several options. Often times problems you have with the initial install of & amarok; are best answered by experts of your particular Unix or Linux distribution. You may seek help from fellow users and developers at the amarok; forum and the IRC channel at irc. freenode. net channel #amarok.
Bugzilla is not a place to seek support. Please do enter a bug if you are serious about helping fix a bug in & amarok; itself.
When I start & amarok;, I see an empty playlist. How do I actually get tracks in there?
Simple. Use the File Browser on the left side to navigate to the desired directory. Then drag the files into the Playlist part on the right.
To avoid interface-clutter "Home" tab has been transformed into "Statistics" tool, available under Tools Statistics.
The meaning of those symbols has changed in Amarok 1.4 "Fast Forward": stars represents the user-defined rating, while numbers shows calculated score.
To rate a track you need a "Rating" column in playlist. Click with the & RMB; on playlist title, and choose Add Column Rating. Click anywhere inside "Rating" column to set up rating for a track. You can also use shortcuts [Win]+[1-5] to quickly rate a song, with Amarok running in the background.
Select the files you want to remove, and press Del key on your keyboard. Or right-click the selection and choose Remove Selected from pop up menu.
Just drag and drop the playlist file into the Playlist, like you would do with any other file. It's that simple!
The Save playlist button is next to Add Media button in the Playlist Toolbar. Just click it!
You probably do n't have xmms-config installed, reconfigure and build after installing the appropriate xmms-devel package. You also may want to install the latest version of libvisual, which has some ultra fancy visualizations.
The Equalizer Window can be found in the right mouse button menu. You can also find it in the Menubar by selecting Tools Equalizer.
None. Yes, that's right! None! We have a backend independent approach, so the question you should be asking is "What media types does GStreamer/ xine/ aRts/ NMM/ MAS/ KDEmm support?" So as you can guess we pretty much support absolutely every audio format you can think of. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!
It can! Chances are you're using Fedora/ RedHat linux, they do n't ship with MP3 decoders by default (due to patenting issues). Solution: Alt-F2, gg: redhat mp3 kde, ENTER
Open the "YaST Online Update" and install the'Multimedia Option Pack 1 'patch. Voila, & amarok; plays MP3's.
When using GStreamer-engine with alsasink, & amarok; requires the device to provide a mixer. Mixing allows multiple applications to access the device at the same time, and output sound simultaneously. This can either be achieved by using a soundcard with hardware-mixing (e. g. SBLive), or by using the "dmix" plugin for alsa, which provides software-mixing. See Setting up Dmix for ALSA.
The output from these commands should help you identify the problems you are having and how to fix them. Please note you may need to use a different sink to test GStreamer (eg. osssink).
We already do! Do n't forget that the media must be decoded first! You ca n't just pipe an MP3 to ALSA, all you will get is white-noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people who want a low-overhead decoding solution, it reads the file, decodes it and pipes the PCM data to ALSA. Exactly like XMMS.
But it decodes it first! GStreamer can output directly to ALSA too! So can xine!
You can either use the GStreamer engine (it's great!), or tweak aRts. Open Control Center Sound and Multimedia Sound System. Enable Run with highest possible priority, and increase the size of the Sound buffer: (warning, see the next FAQ!) You should also ensure that your artswrapper is suid:
With KDE 3.2. x there are issues with the KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause distorted playback, please see this bug report. Also, increasing the size of the sound buffer in your. asoundrc alsa configuration file can help a great deal.
Either do n't use the aRts-engine, use the GStreamer or xine engines, or address the high CPU usage by installing KDEMultimedia in its entirety to get the faster aRts codecs (eg. libarts_mpeglib. so, etc.)
You are probably using the aRts-engine, either use another engine (the xine-engine has been seriously tweaked to give perfect analyzer-sync), or reduce the size of your aRts buffer in kcontrol, sound system. The lower the buffer the more responsive the visuals. Yes this is a bug, please help us fix it!
I have GStreamer installed but when I try to change to the GStreamer engine & amarok; crashes, what gives?
After installing GStreamer you have register it's components, running ` gst-register ` (sometimes suffixed with a version, so gst-register-0.8) should take care of registering your GStreamer components.
You can try the GStreamer FAQ. If all else fails you can try the knowledgeable people at the #gstreamer IRC channel.
Try this (make sure that & amarok; does not run): - Download, compile and install the ffmpeg package - Run gst-register (you may need to run it twice, as root and as your "normal" user) - Go to your GStreamer plugin directory (you can find it with gst-config / gstreamer-config) - Delete the ffmpeg files (or move them somewhere else) - Run gst-register again - Start & amarok;
Please report it at bugs. kde. org, if you have a list of suggestions/ wishes it may be best to send them to our mailing list: amarok-devel@lists. sourceforge. net
& amarok; is an album by British composer Mike Oldfield. I happen to like it a lot, and I think the name's got a nice sound. Plus, of course, it contains the all important“ K”..:)
Actually, thanks to the magic of DCOP you already can:) Simply set an alarm in your favorite calendar program and tell it to run the following command: dcop amarok player play
This command will tell & amarok; to start playing. Make sure that & amarok; is running before you go to bed, and you should wake up to the merry tune of whatever you pressed stop on before going to bed.
How do I get what & amarok; is playing right now, when I'm on another computer?
If you have a properly set up ssh environment, you can use that to get the information. The following command will return the Now Playing string. ssh -i ~/. ssh/ id_rsa yourip dcop --user yourusername amarok player nowPlaying
Make sure that you replace yourip with your IP and yourusername with your username. Also note that this expects your identification to be found in the ~/. ssh/ id_rsa file.
The & amarok; player analyzers can be detached from the Player Window. By pressing d on your keyboard the active analyzer will open in an independent, re-sizeable window.
Holding Control and clicking the right mouse button enqueues files in the order in which you clicked them. Pressing Enter after making a playlist search will play the first search item and will clear the search.
I see the Player Window and Playlist Window have neat tricks, what about the tray icon?
Clicking with the & RMB; on any browser title shows up a list of visible browsers. You can use this list to disable/ re-enable any browsers available.
My $HOME is located on NFS. After startup, & amarok; fails to build the Collection, printing many database errors to the console. What to do?
The internal SQLite database which & amarok; uses by default does not work on NFS. You must either link your ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ amarok directory to a local drive, or use the MySQL support.
Insert your CD, then click on "Play Audio CD" in the menu. The File-Browser will come up and show a tree with several folders. For normal ripping, go to the "wav" folder, select some tracks and drag them to the desired destination in a Konqueror window. For automatic encoding, drag files from the "mp3" or "ogg" folder instead.
QStringList values = query( QString( "SELECT playcounter, createdate, percentage FROM statistics" "WHERE url = '%1 ';"). arg( escapeString( url)));
Basically, this adjusts the previous score (statistics_percentage) by a decreasing amount depending on how many times the track has been played. The more times the track has been played, the less of an impact each play has on the score.
You may change the rating manually by right-clicking on the playlist columns titles (the ones that say title, artist, album etc) and select Score. You can then change the score like any other song attribute, by right clicking it and selecting "Edit Tag'Score '" or pressing F2. You can also edit the score in the Tag dialog, available by right clicking on a track.
The developers do n't want the man telling them when they can release. (Meaning, packages in KDE proper have a release schedule that does n't fit with & amarok; 's fast-paced development).
This is a new feature that has been added that some users might find distracting. Simply uncheck the "Flash icon tray when playing" option under General Options.
The playlist analyzer is part of the playlist toolbar. Select Settings Configure Toolbars Add/ Remove Analyzer to the Current actions Press OK
Download a theme or make your own. Install it through Configure & amarok;... Appearance Context Browser Style, click Install New Style.
The icon was way too similar to the Warp Graphics, Inc. logo (elfquest. com), so it had to be removed to avoid problems.
Konqueror sidebar allows you to monitor/ control & amarok; while browsing with Konqueror. To see it, run Konqueror, press F9 to see sidebar, click on preferences (top one) button, in dropdown menu choose Add amarok; Konqueror Sidebar.
Audioscrobbler is a free service that sends information regarding which songs are played to an independent server. The service signup is free and only requires that you pick a user name and password that is not already in use. Audioscrobbler is currently utilized in & amarok;.
If you output to ALSA, you should use the newest available version of ALSA possible! Old versions of ALSA have caused plenty of crashes, and have caused plenty of wrongly attributed crash-reports.
& amarok; was probably compiled before you had xine and/ or gstreamer installed, so the. / configure routine did not include them in the list of engines to be built. You will have to rebuild & amarok;.
But I did rebuild & amarok; after installing gstreamer and/ or xine, but the engine still does not show up. What happened?
You most likely are using a distro that packages development libraries separately from the main library, so even though gstreamer is installed, & amarok; cannot link to it because gstreamer-devel is not installed. The same issue exists for xine, you must install xine-devel if your distro splits packages in this fashion. Do n't forget to rebuild & amarok; after installing the devel packages.
I'm getting this error: "GStreamer-CRITICAL **: Factory for ` adder 'has no type.". How to fix?
Your GStreamer was built with Prelinking, which is not compatible with GStreamer. You must rebuild it without this option. merlin-tc advises: In addition, do n't use any ldflags when building GStreamer.
You receive an error "There is no element present to handle the file's mimetype audio/ mp4" even though you have the correct gstreamer-faad plugin is installed.
To correctly play mp4 or m4a files with gstreamer, you must also have gstreamer-quicktime in addition to gstreamer-faad installed.
You receive an error "There is no element present to handle the stream's mimetype audio/ mpeg"
You are trying to play an mp3 stream without the gstreamer-mad plugin installed. Install the gstreamer-mad plugin and run "gst-register" as root before restarting & amarok;.
I have a second soundcard and I'm using ALSA. How do I make Amarok use it instead of the default?
In Settings Configure Amarok Engine, check the'Device 'checkbox and fill in the device. Typical this is'hw:0' for the default soundcard, and'hw:1 'for the second soundcard.
Here is a sample ~/. asoundrc for a machine that has an onboard Intel AC97 codec and a usb-audio device:
pcm. intel8x0 {type plug slave. pcm "hw:0"} ctl. intel8x0 {type hw card 0} pcm. usb-audio {type plug slave. pcm "hw:1"} ctl. usb-audio {type hw card 1}
Now enter usb-audio in the xine-engine setup screen and output should go to the usb-audio device (with alsa-lib properly handling sample rate conversion, channels, and so on).
To use a dmixed virtual device, ensure that the "sound card can do mmap" checkbox is unchecked.
Sorry, aRts-engine has no maintainer, but feel free to fix it yourself! You could be the new aRts-engine maintainer we need so desperately!
Listening to music should be easy. To this end we have provided a First-Run Wizard which presents itself the first time & amarok; is run. For those who wish to update their collection later on, or not use the wizard, this Quick Start Guide is for you. It will help you have & amarok; up and running in minutes.
Making a playlist is as simple as dragging items from the Collection Browser Tree View into the Playlist. To make searching for items easier, a text box is provided for filtering your collection. Just start typing in the text box, and the Tree View will change to show only the relevant results. After you are satisfied with your playlist, you can save it by clicking the Save Playlist As button found in the Playlist menu.
If you have your own playlists, you can add them in the Playlist Browser by clicking the Add button and choosing the Playlist... option in the toolbar. If your collection folders have your playlists in them, and you selected the Import Playlists in the collection setup, your playlists will already be in the Tree View. Right clicking a playlist in the Tree View will give you several options of how to load the playlist.
To play an audio cd, select Actions Play Audio CD in the Playlist Menubar. The File Browser will open showing several folders and also the cd tracks listed in the WAV format. Drag the WAV files into the playlist and click the Play button.
The Play Audio CD feature uses the audiocd: / protocol and is not compatible with all of the available engines.
Burning functionality is also provided in the Playlist. Simply right click an item in the Playlist and follow the Burn menu for multiple cd burning options.
& amarok; requires the installation of some software packages. The required packages are listed below along with several other packages to enhance your & amarok; experience.
If you obtain these dependencies via a packaging system, you must also install the devel versions of these packages!
& amarok; is a versatile audio player that offers many different ways of controlling your music collection. Like any ordinary audio player, & amarok; has a player window for controlling your most basic functions. & amarok; also has a playlist that is second to none. The playlist window has multiple browsers for creating and browsing your entire audio collection.
In this chapter we will go over how to use all the features of & amarok; including creating a collection and a playlist.
The player window is your one click & amarok; control center. At the top of the player there is a scrolling display to show the currently playing track or stream. Just below the scrolling display there is an area to display the current track's play time, bit rate, and sample rate. Clicking this area will change the track time from total played to total time remaining.
The player window also features a selection of audio analyzers also located under the scrolling display. You can cycle through the available analyzers by left clicking the analyzer area.
The & amarok; player analyzers can be detached from the player window. By pressing D on your keyboard the active analyzer will open in an independent, re-sizeable window.
Also below the scrolling display are the PL and EQ buttons. The PL button is used to quickly enable or disable the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to enable and disable the equalizer if your engine is compatible.
The remainder of the player includes the playback buttons and the volume and track position sliders. Use the sliders to choose a track position or volume level that suits your needs. Use the playback buttons to control the playback of the current track, or to skip either forward or back through your tracks.
The built in equalizer is easy to use and works with all engines. There are 17 presets included, ranging from Classical to Techno, and you can easily create your own.
To access the equalizer choose Tools Equalizer from the main window or click the EQ button from the Player window. Once you check the Enable Equalizer check box in this window, the equalizer will be active.
The & amarok; playlist is the most advanced playlist available to any audio player for & kde;. The playlist offers many features that are not found in any other player. You should not be intimidated by the power of the playlist however, as it is still the easiest to use.
The playlist window can be divided into two main sections, on the left is the sidebar. The sidebar is where you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist like the Context Browser. On the right side of the window is the playlist itself. The playlist is simple to use yet powerful enough for even the most advanced users.
The Context Browser displays various information related to the currently playing track. Its appearance can be modified by using themes known as Context Browser Styles. It is organized into three tabs: Music, Lyrics, and Artist. These tabs, whose function will be more fully explained below, supply information on different aspects the track currently being listened to.
Users of previous & amarok; versions will notice that there is no longer a Home tab. The information from this tab has been redistributed throughout the & amarok; interface. Analogous information can be found mainly in the Statistics dialog, accessible through Tools Statistics.
The Music tab offers information about the currently playing track, and it's artist and album.
The first pane in this tab is for information about the track. The title of the pane lists the track name, artist name, and album. Inside the pane you will find it shows the album cover image for the track. Next to the image you will find a MusicBrainz icon. Click this icon to do a MusicBrainz look-up for the track.
Below the MusicBrainz icon there is more information about you current track. Here you will find the total number of times the track has been played, the track's current score, and when the track was first and last played.
To display album cover images in the Context Browser you must have the album cover image in the same directory as the track you are listening to. Supported file formats are. jpg,. jpeg,. gif, and. png. The images can be named anything, but images with the word front in the filename will be used with preference. The Context Browser will also use cover images saved from the album cover downloader, or images embedded in ID3v2 tags.
The next pane, Suggested Songs, lists multiple tracks for suggested listening. Click on any of the listed tracks to begin playback of the track.
Below Suggested Songs is the Favorite Tracks By Artist. This pane lists the five highest rated tracks by the current track's artist.
You can adjust the amount of information shown in the Music tab by right-clicking anywhere on Music tab and toggling items on the context menu.
The last pane, Albums By Artists, lists all of the albums by the current track's artists that are in your collection. Clicking on any of the albums in this pane will expand the album to show the album's content.
You can click on tracks in any of the panes to begin playback of the track. You can also right click albums and tracks for a pop-up menu to choose several ways to play or enqueue the track or album.
Lyrics tabs fetches lyrics for the currently played song from one of the supported websites. This feature is flexible, and it's possible to write scripts to fetch lyrics from different sites. See Chapter on Script-Writing. When you click on the Lyrics tab, & amarok; attempts to fetch lyrics for the current track. If there is no lyrics script running you will be given the opportunity to select one.
The Edit button allows you to edit lyrics for the current track. They are then stored in & amarok; 's collection database. This does not require a lyrics script to be active.
The Search button launches a google. com search (in an external browser) for the lyrics of the current track.
Group By Artist - Top level sort only, every track is grouped under its artist, with no consideration given to albums or genres.
Group By Artist/ Album - Tracks are sorted into artists, and then beneath this, sorted by album. If you want to see compilation or soundtrack albums, this is the best way to view your collection - these albums are grouped together at the very begin of your list, under Various Artists.
Group By Artist/ Year-Album - Sorts by artist, with albums in descending order of year (most recent first). If there is no Year tag set for a track, the default 0 - album name.
Group By Album - Every album in your collection is displayed alphabetically based on the album name, regardless of artist.
Group By Genre/ Artist - Tracks are grouped according to their genre tag, then by artist.
Group By Genre/ Artist/ Album - Same as above, only with tracks sorted by album, below each artist.
The remaining items on the pulldown menu allow you to customise the grouping with any combination of the above.
The last icon in the toolbar lets you change your collection setup. Note that if you change any folders, & amarok; will automatically rescan your collection - this may take quite some time if you have many tracks.
Immediately below the toolbar is a search filter, which behaves the same in both Flat and Tree views. See the Playlist section of the handbook for more details on searching techniques.
Below the Search Filter, another pull-down menu lets you see the most recently added tracks to your collection. Several time periods are available, ranging from the last 24 hours, to 1 year, or your entire collection.
The following options are accessible by clicking with the & RMB; on entries in the collection browser.
Load - Clears the current playlist and adds selected track(s) as first track(s), in sort order.
Append to Playlist - Adds selected track(s) to end of current playlist. Double clicking on a single track in the collection also achieves the same result.
Queue Tracks - Adds the selected track(s) to the queue as the next to be played.
Save as Playlist - Save the selected tracks as a playlist. You'll be prompted for a name to save as.
Add to Media Device Transfer Queue - Adds track(s) to a queue, ready to be transferred to a media device, when such a device is attached. See Media Device Browser section for more detail.
Burn All Tracks By This Artist/ Burn To CD - Sends track(s) to & k3b; for burning as either a data or Audio CD. If & k3b; is not installed, this option is not selectable.
Edit Information for (n) Tracks - Opens the Track Information dialog and allows you to change tags for one or more tracks.
Delete (n) Files - Pops up a confirmation dialog asking whether you want to permanently delete the selected track(s) from your computer.
Mark As Compilation - Sets the selected album as a compilation album, to be listed under Various Artists
Unmark As Compilation - Changes an album marked as a compilation to a normal album, and moves the listing from Various Artists, to back under the artists listed.
The Playlist Browser is used for easy handling of your multiple playlists. The Playlist Browser also features built in smart playlists making it the most clever playlist browser around.
The bottom section of the Playlist Browser is the Smart Playlists. The Smart Playlists use & amarok; 's built in data base to compile some useful playlists on the fly. The Smart Playlists include the following:
Never Played: a playlist of the tracks in your collection which have never been played before.
User defined smart playlists are also possible. Clicking the Create Smart-Playlist button will open a dialog to configure a smart playlist to fit your criteria.
The Media Device panel is used for connecting your iPod, to & amarok;. To use your iPod with the Media Device browser you must have your iPod mounted at / mnt/ ipod before starting & amarok;. Once you have started & amarok; you will find the tracks on your iPod listed by artist in a listview at the top of the browser.
To add tracks to your iPod, drag the tracks you want to add from the playlist and drop them on the Artist listview. After you are done adding tracks to the list click the Transfer button to upload them to your iPod. After the transfer has completed, close & amarok; and unmount your iPod.
Below the toolbar is a handy search bar for searching by file name. You will find the search bar useful for directories with many files as it searches as you type leaving only the relevant file names in the view.
At the bottom of the File Browser is an address bar for accessing your music from any URL that you type. For instance typing tar: / home/ mike/ music. tar. gz into the address bar and pressing & Enter; on your keyboard will allow you to access the files inside the music tar ball. Now you can drag the audio from the tar ball and drop it into the playlist.
When playlist grows larger than one screenful, it becomes hard to append files by simply dropping them. Holding & Shift; key on keyboard while dropping may help in this case: the files will be appended at the end of playlist rather than inserted at current drop position.
The Playlist holds all the tracks you have en-queued for playing. You can change the sequence by dragging items around with the mouse, and dropping them in the desired position. Above the Playlist you see a Text Box, where you can enter a filter string. As soon as you enter a letter there, the Playlist will be redisplayed, showing only entries containing the entered characters. To stop the filtering, simply press & Backspace;, until the filter is empty.
By default, when you enter terms separated by spaces, it will search for items containing all of them. For example: one two three, will search for anything that contains one, two, and three.
However, you can put OR between terms to search for items that contain either, like this: one OR two OR three. That way, it will search for items that contain either one, or two, or three (or a combination of them).
You can also use quotes to search for terms with spaces in them: "Mike Oldfield". That will search for items that contain Mike Oldfield, but not, for example, ones that contain Mike J. Oldfield.
When specifying a specific column to search in, you can also search for items less than or greater than a term, for example: score: > 50, which will search for items with a score greater than 50.
To specify a term you do n't want the items to match, you can put a minus (-) sign before them: -thing, to search for anything that does n't contain thing.
You can combine the above at will, for example: "Mike Oldfield" OR score: > 50 -comment: bad. That will search for anything that either contains Mike Oldfield or has a score greater than 50, but excludes items where the comment contains "bad".
You can select items to be played in a specific order by holding & Ctrl; and clicking the & RMB; on items in the order in which you wish them to be played. The items will be tagged with a number showing the order in which you selected them.
The Playlist Window Toolbar is found near the bottom of the Playlist Window. The Toolbar contains buttons for many of the Playlist actions. On the right side of the Toolbar you can find the Add Media button, which opens a file dialog to add your media files to the playlist. Following the Add Media button are the Save Playlist, Clear Playlist, and Refresh Playlist buttons. You can use these buttons for handling the current Playlist.
The next set of buttons are the Undo, and Redo buttons. You can use these buttons to Undo or Redo any changes made to the playlist.
In the center of the Toolbar you can find a unique, re-sizeable analyzer. You can adjust the refresh rate for the analyzer by using the & RMB; menu, and selecting your desired frame rate.
The last button in the Toolbar is the Menu button. The Menu button opens the same menu as the Player Window & RMB; menu. You can use this menu for accessing the & amarok; configuration options.
There are many other buttons available for the Toolbar including player control buttons and a volume slider. You can configure what buttons are in the Toolbar by clicking the Menu button and selecting Configure Toolbars...
The Status Bar provides quick access to some useful information about the playlist. The Status Bar displays the current track's title, the number of tracks in the playlist along with the total playlist time, Random and Repeat status, a mini track position slider, and the current track's play time. You can change the Random and Repeat status by double clicking there respective areas in the status bar.
You can also choose to not have the Status Bar displayed using the Show statusbar option in the Configure General Options Dialog.
The & RMB; menu can be found by right clicking the player window, it can also be found by clicking the Menu button in the playlist window. The & RMB; menu is used for access to all of & amarok; 's options.
Clicking this option opens the Visualizations Window for choosing what visualizations to use with & amarok;.
This entry provides a sub-menu providing links to this document and other & amarok; information.
The Album Cover Manager is a useful tool for managing your album covers. You can start the Cover Manager by selecting Actions Cover Manager in the Collection Browser.
The cover manager provides a listview of all the albums in your collection. You can view all of your album covers for an artist by clicking on the artist in the list view.
The View menu allows you to choose what is displayed in the cover manager. You can choose from:
The Queue Manager makes it's grand entrance in & amarok; 1.3. This feature is designed to enable users to have even more control over their playlists. After queuing, a track a number will be shown beside it in the Queue Manager. This number indicates the order in which & amarok; will play the track: one will be first, two will be second, and so on.
You can use the Queue Manager by opening it from Tools Queue Manager, selecting the track, and then pressing the + icon in the Queue Manager. You can also just drag tracks to the Queue Manager to create a queue. Alternatively, the playlist's context menu may also be used and the Queue Manager can then be opened in order to modify the order.
There are three types of Dynamic Playlists, referred to as Dynamic Modes, two of which are predefined (more details on configuring this later).
Initialises a playlist with random tracks from you're entire collection, and keeps adding random tracks.
Adds tracks based on last. fm (formerly audioscrobbler) suggestions. Requires some tracks already in the playlist. Note you do not need a last. fm profile for this to work.
Simply double-click your desired playlist, drag it to the playlist window, or right-click and select Load. This will replace your current playlist, so you may want to save that first if it's important to you.
Both Random Mix and Playlist Shuffle will populate your playlist and allow you to start playing immediately. Suggested Songs will start with an empty playlist, requiring you to add at least one song from your collection manually. The suggestions are added on a track change, so your playlist will not be populated until the end of the first song.
If you wish to retain your current playlist, you can enable the last type of Dynamic Mode used by selecting Settings Dynamic Mode. This will use your existing playlist as a starting point. You can disable Dynamic Mode via the same menu option.
The Repopulate button will clear your playlist and re-add tracks according to the Dynamic Mode you are using, and the Edit this Dynamic Mode button will pop up the Dynamic Mode Settings dialog.
Right-clicking on a Dynamic Playlist will allow you to select Edit, which opens the Dynamic Mode Settings dialog box.
Rename to anything you like, if you so desire. Playlist names should be unique, to avoid confusion.
If you uncheck this, your playlists will continually grow, the Upcoming Tracks setting is overridden, and you will not get repeats in your playlist. If the setting is checked, played tracks are removed from the start of the list, according to the Played tracks to show setting below.
Played tracks to show - number of played tracks to leave showing at the start of the playlist. Useful for seeing what has been played recently.
The number of tracks that will be added to your playlist after each song is played. Note that if you set this greater than 1, your playlist will grow rapidly, as only one track can be played then removed at a time.
The settings on the right are as described in the previous section. In the panel on the left, you can select from any of the existing playlists and smart playlists on your system. If you select multiple playlists, & amarok; will add random tracks from each of these.
Some scripts provide special configuration options. To access these options first run the script and then click the Configure button to access the script's configuration dialog.
To install new & amarok; scripts click the Install Script button in the Script Manager dialog. A select file dialog will open allowing you to select an & amarok; script package. After selecting a package to install a new entry for the script will appear in the listview. You can also install new scripts by clicking the Get More Scripts button, which opens a Dialog for downloading and installing scripts automatically from the internet.
You may also find that there are scripts that you no longer use. To uninstall a script select the script in the Script Manager listview and click the Uninstall button.
If you are looking for information on writing an & amarok; script, please see the Script Writing section of this document.
The Visualizations Window is used to enable your available visualizations with & amarok;. A list of your available visualizations will be provided in the window. To enable a visualization check the provided checkbox for the specific visualization.
This Quickguide shows you how to create a AudioCD with & k3b;. To reproduce these steps you need a working & k3b; and a directory in which you have audiofiles.
This is a dialog where you can select which files you want to burn on a CD
When you burn AudioCD from MP3 s or other lossy compressed music, remember that if you encode this CD back to MP3, you'll get poorer quality regardless the bitrate you use. To check whether AudioCD was burnt from lossy format, try auCDtect.
In this dialog is nothing you can do. Just wait for you computer to finish the session.
This Quickguide shows you how to create a Data-CD with & k3b;. To reproduce these steps you need a working & k3b; and the CD you wish to copy inserted in your CD-ROM.
To copy a Data-CD you select Tools, CD Copy CD... You will see a dialog where you can set up the burning.
After you have set up & k3b; click on Start CD Copy. You will get a dialog similar to this:
In this dialog you can watch to progress of the copying. As soon as the writing of the image-file is done you will be asked for a empty CD on which the data will be burned.
& k3b; is burning the Image file. You have to wait until the Overall process is at 100%
& k3b; is burning the Image file. You have to wait until the Overall process is at 100%.
The QTDesigner tool uic is not able to find the kde widget plugins. To solve this run qtconfig and add $KDEDIR / lib/ kde3/ plugins to the plugin search path (replace $KDEDIR with your kde base dir).
The main information site for & k3b; is www. k3b. org. For the most current version of & k3b;, feedback and community help as well as & k3b; news and other information, this is the place to go.
In order to successfully use & k3b;, you need & kde; & gt; = 3.1 and & Qt; & gt; = 3.1.
& cdrdao;: Records audio or data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode based on a textual description of the CD contents (toc-file).
& cdrecord; /mkisofs;: Records any kind of CD-Rs. & cdrecord; contains all of & cdrdao; 's features and extended functionality and therefore is & k3b; 's standard choice for CD burning. In some cases, & cdrdao; reaches better audio CD burning quality though.
cdparanoia: A Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) extraction tool, commonly known on the net as a'ripper '.
Ogg Vorbis library: Ogg Vorbis is a completely open, patent-free, professional audio encoding and streaming technology with all the benefits of Open Source, and in direct competition with the MP3 format. Used by the Ogg Vorbis Decoder and Encoder plugins.
MAD (MPEG Audio Decoder) Library: A high-quality MPEG audio decoder, supporting the MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG 2.5 formats. All three audio layers Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III (i. e. MP3) are fully implemented. Used by the MP3 Decoder plugin.

FLAC: A free, open source codec for lossless audio compression and decompression. Used by the FLAC Decoder plugin and the External Audio Encoder plugin, so you can read and write FLAC files.
Libsndfile, FFmpeg, FLAC, Musepack decoders: Other libraries for processing a broad range of audio file formats. For example, with FFmpeg it is possible to decode WMA files in order to burn them onto audio CDs. Used by the respective plugins.
SoX: A utility that can convert between various audio file formats. Used by the SoX Audio Encoder plugin.
transcode: A Linux text-console utility for video stream processing. You need this if you want to rip DVD video.
VCDImager: A full-featured mastering suite for authoring, disassembling and analyzing Video CDs and Super Video CDs.
Normalize: A tool for adjusting the volume of audio files to a standard level. This is useful for things like creating mixed CDs and MP3 collections, where different recording levels on different albums can cause the volume to vary greatly from song to song.
eMovix: A tiny Linux distribution that is burned on CD together with video files. eMovix contains all the software to boot from a CD and automatically play every video file localized in the CD root.
This is a shortcut to re-open recently opened projects. The sub-menu belonging to this item contains a list of these projects, clicking on a specific file will open it again.
Saves the current project. If there has already been a save of the document then this will overwrite the previously saved file without asking for the user's consent. If it is the first save of a new document the Save As dialog will be invoked.
Saves the current project with a new file name. KDE's Save As dialog appears to specify name and directory of the new project file.
Saves all open projects. This is the same as selecting File Save for each of them.
Closes the current project. If a project has been modified but not yet saved then & k3b; will ask what to do. You can choose to save or discard the changes, and you also have the opportunity to cancel closing and keep the project open.
Closes all open projects. For each unsaved project & k3b; will ask what to do, just like it does when File Close is selected.
Quits & k3b; after closing all of its open projects. For every unsaved project & k3b; will ask what to do, just like it does when File Close is selected.
When this item is selected, the appearing dialog lets you choose one or more files to be added to the project. This has the same effect as dragging files directly from the Contents View into the Project View. If the current project is a data disc project, the added files will appear in the disc's root directory.
Opens the Burn dialog for the current project. This is in fact the same as the Properties dialog - the only difference is that there is an additional Burn button which causes & k3b; to burn a disc from project data. The Burn dialog wo n't open if the project does not contain any files.
Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. Here you can specify a lot of options concerning the project. Every project type has got a different set of options, most of them can be explained by using What's This (accessible by right-mouse-clicking).
This Item only appears if a Data CD/ DVD or Video DVD project is active. It causes K3b to import the file entries from the previous session to the current project. You can use this when compiling files for multi-session discs. Hence that data from the previous session is always included, even if you do n't choose to make use of this command. It just helps to know what's on the disc already.
This Item only appears if a Data CD/ DVD or Video DVD project is active. It causes K3b to remove the file entries from the current project that were imported by Project Import Session while keeping all of the other data in the project. Hence that making use of this command does n't actually remove anything from the disc that will be burned, it just hides these files again.
Opens the CD Copy dialog. Without the need of a project file, it provides the ability to copy a CD's content to another disc. Alternatively, you can choose only to create an image of the source CD which can be burned anytime. There is also an option to clone the CD instead of normal copying, which should be preferred when copying CDs with defective sectors or Video CDs.
Opens the DVD Copy dialog. Without the need of a project file, it provides the ability to copy a DVD's content to another disc. Alternatively, you can choose only to create an image of the source DVD which can be burned anytime. Video transcoding within the DVD Copy dialog is not yet supported, so the destination disc has to be large enough to contain all of the source disc's (video) data in its original form.
Opens the Erase CD-RW dialog. With its help you can clear the contents of a CD-RW, or part of it.
Opens the DVD Formatting dialog. With its help you can format a DVD-R(W) or DVD+R(W), which causes the disc's contents to be deleted. & k3b; gives the choice between the "Overwrite" and "Incremental" writing modes.
Burns a previously created CD image. The Burn CD Image dialog asks to select an *. iso, *. cue or *. toc file as data source that you can instantly burn by pressing the Start button. (Nero *. nrg files are currently not supported, so you have to make use of other tools like Nrg2Iso.)
Burns a previously created DVD image. The Burn Iso9660 Image dialog asks to select an *. iso file as data source that you can instantly burn by pressing the Start button.
A DVD video that has already been ripped can be encoded with a little help from the Encoding Video dialog. This dialog box normally opens after ripping the DVD from within the Contents View, but can also be used standalone. It contains information about the ripped DVD video, encoding options and even video resizing and cropping abilities.
Shows information about the inserted disk. This information will be displayed in the Contents View and covers disk properties like type, size and track length of the CD or DVD in your drive.
Pops up a list of & k3b; 's toolbars. If a toolbar entry is checked, it means that the toolbar is currently visible.
This enables you to show or hide the small bar at the bottom of the main window containing various information about & k3b; 's status and activities.
Toggles the visibility of the Directory View. This view enables you to select directories and disc drives. When selected, their contents will appear in the Contents View. Disc drives have also got a context menu providing functions like Disk Info, (un)mounting the drive or ejecting the medium.
Toggles the visibility of the Contents View. This view enables you to select files that can be dragged into the Project View in order to add them to the project. The Contents View also acts as an interface to rip audio CDs and video discs when a disc drive containing an appropriate CD/ DVD is selected in the Directory View.
Toggles the visibility of the document header belonging to the Project View. This is a small bar that is only visible if the Project View contains any open projects. The document header has no functionality, yet it's nice eye candy and improves clarity by separating the Project View from the other views.
This command opens a dialog box where the key bindings for & k3b; 's menu commands may be changed. After selecting one of the available commands from the upper part of the dialog, the shortcut for this action can be changed in the lower part.
This opens & k3bsetup; which helps setting the right permissions needed by & k3b; in order to burn CDs and DVDs. Linux 'user rights management permits program execution and access to disc drives if no permissions have been granted by the administrator. & k3bsetup; cannot set permissions without administrator privileges, so you have to enter the root password when starting up.
Opens the Options dialog where general program settings can be configured. Although most of & k3b; 's functionality should work out of the box, this dialog allows to customize and fine-tune the program.
& k3b; features, like many other & kde; applications as well, a & DCOP; interface which makes it possible to control a part of it's functionality from & eg; a shellscript.
To use these & DCOP; functions you can either use the dcop commandline program or the more convenient Kdcop application. Both provide the same functionality so it's mostly a matter of taste and context of usage when deciding which way to choose.
This chapter assumes that you're using the dcop commandline program. To access & k3b; 's & DCOP; functions, make sure that & k3b; is started and then enter something like this at a console:
Besides the generic & DCOP; functions available to all & kde; applications, & k3b; 's DCOP interface mainly consists of two parts as described below.
The default K3b DCOP interface provides functionality like copyCD, formatDVD, and methods for creating new projects.
DCOPRef createDataCDProject() DCOPRef createAudioCDProject() DCOPRef createMixedCDProject() DCOPRef createVideoCDProject() DCOPRef createMovixCDProject() DCOPRef createDataDVDProject() DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject() DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject() DCOPRef openProject(KURL url) QValueListlt; DCOPRefgt; projects() DCOPRef currentProject() void copyCd() void copyDvd() void eraseCdrw() void formatDvd() void burnCdImage(KURL url) void burnDvdImage(KURL url)
As result from one of the createXXXProject methods one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef(k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you may create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then retrieve a reference to this project with # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject Using this reference it is possible to manipulate the project using the K3bProjectInterface.
K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface as listed above or the more powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which only applies to data projects (CD and DVD):

Using this it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. The following script for example creates a new data project, adds several folders to the project, and adds files to the newly created folders:
#! /bin/ bash PROJECT=$(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home/ trueg/ somefile. txt / foo/ bar
& kaudiocreator; is an audio & CD; ripper for & kde;. With it you can easily rip your audio & CD; s to mp3 or ogg files or other formats, depending on whatever encoder you have installed on your system.
& kaudiocreator; is a frontend to cdparanoia (for ripping the & CD; data to wav files on your hard disk) and many encoders which encode (compress) these wav files. Currently lame for mp3, oggenc for oggs and flac (lossless compression) are supported out of the box (you may still need to install these encoder packages from your distro). But you can add more encoders with the program (if you have them installed).
first the & CD; tracks/ songs are ripped to the computer into wav files (lossless, uncompressed) and then
in a second step these wav files (usually one per song) are compressed into mp3 or ogg format or other formats like the lossless flac.
For the 1st step, the ripping of the & CD;, & kaudiocreator; uses cdparanoia. Nearly every distro has a pre-compiled package, so install it, if you have n't done so already.
For the 2nd step you need lame (for mp3), oggvorbis (for ogg) or other encoders to be installed. All these programs are usually provided for whatever linux distribution you may have, so it is most likely not necessary to compile anything yourself. You just might need to install any of these packages. You only have to install the encoder package you want to need. If you for instance do n't need flac, there is no need to install it.
What encoder/ file format to use? The What encoder chapter gives you a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.
One word to copy protected audio & CD; s: As already said, & kaudiocreator; uses cdparanoia to rip the audio data from the & CD;. This program is not designed to crack any copy protection. So unless your & CD; /DVD-player firmware circumvents the protection, you will fail to rip protected audio & CD; s. In any case & kaudiocreator; itself cannot handle or work around any protection mechanism. You better avoid buying copy protected audio & CD; s!
While the setup has only to be done once (you can however tweak it as often as you like until you find a suitable setup for yourself), you will then learn the daily business of ripping a & CD; to the harddrive. It is (hopefully) then when you will understand and learn to like the lean approach of the interface you may have stumbled over at first.
can encode to many formats - depends on what encoder programs you have installed (mp3, ogg, flac & etc;)
can fetch & CD; information from freedb via the Internet or you can work completely off line, entering everything manually
This is just a brief list of the commands of the main window. See the full walkthrough example for more details how to use this program and screenshots with descriptions about the program configuration tabs.
Starts the CDDB lookup of the & CD; data according your settings from the Lookup tab on the CDDB page. (Can be local or online, in the later case you have to connect to the Internet first.)
Starts the ripping and, if an encoder is selected on the Encoder Configuration tab in the settings dialog, the encoding.
Opens a sub-menu with a list of the available encoders, so you can rip a selection with another encoder than the standard one. Note, that the encoder should have been configured on the Encoder Configuration tab in the settings dialog.
Opens a file browser so you can select an already ripped file to encode rather then rip and encode a complete & CD;.
Opens the configuration window to configure the type of notification (like logs, beeps) for program events (like finished & CD; ripping).
Opens & kaudiocreator; main configuration dialog with several tabs (like Encoder, for the encoder configuration). You have to go here before you will be able to successfully use this program!
This chapter is about audio quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you to choose the right encoder
If you do n't want to lose any audio information you need a lossless audio format. Beside flac there are others like shorten or monkey, which may be available for your distro. The down side is that the compression rates will be low and hardly any commercial device can play these files.
Between the audio formats which do lose information due to data compression according their psychoacustic model, mp3 and ogg are the most common. ogg may today have a slight advantage over mp3 in audio quality on lower bit rates (up to 128 kbps), but above that rate the differences become less important, as both encoders produce very good audio quality.
o'not so 'free, lame comes for free with most distros but there are license issues
+ good to very good (high bit rates) audio quality, though slightly lower at lower bit rates compared to ogg
ogg - if you want to listening to the music only via your computer or a computer based music server and/ or you already have one of the few ogg playing players.
mp3 - if you want to listen to your music on other devices as well, like standard DVD players, portable players (USB stick, flash card, HD) or special car stereos. Today, early 2009, most of these devices only support the mp3 format.
A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for lame (mp3s) (check lame --help for more):
'--preset medium '= This preset should provide near transparency to most people on most music
'--preset standard '= This preset should generally be transparent to most people on most music and is already quite high in quality. Good enough for high quality home HiFi systems.
'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. Uses up to 320 kbps for complex music parts and way less for less complex parts of the song. Good enough for high quality home HiFi systems. This should be the preferred choice.
'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. Uses always 256 kbps for complex and not so complex music parts of the song. Some older players need CBRs. Good enough for high quality home HiFi systems.
'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all parts of the song. Good enough for kids music, portable players and, well, car stereos. Not good enough for better home Hifi systems, though.
'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. This preset will usually be overkill for most people and most situations, but if you must have the absolute highest quality with no regard to filesize, this is the way to go.
The & CD; information you enter or the program fetches automatically from freedb via the Internet, is available as a list of parameters within the program which can be parsed to/ used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoder programs in order to create folder and file names and or generate tags in the song files.
When used with encoder programs, often you have to use a combination of program switches from the encoder program and these parameters here. The manual or help of the encoders will tell you the switches for these programs.
E. g. to add the & CD; title to a tag when encoding mp3s with lame you have to add the -tt switch from lame followed by the title parameter from & kaudiocreator;. The result looks then like '... -tt {title}...'.
This is a summary of the parameters from & kaudiocreator; you can use (= button name in the wizard):
That's what freedb is, a free database where audio & CD; rippers can input/ upload the infos of a & CD; so that everybody else can download this information rather than typing it into the computer each by themselves. Note, we are only talking text here: & CD; title, artist, song names & etc;, not the audio file itself.
Yes, it should be legal, but I am not a lawyer. However, nobody can prevent you from issuing the & CD; information which is openly available on the & CD; anyhow. And better, without the & CD; the info is more or less pointless, so no damage can be done to the artists or the audio companies. You can obtain all the information anyhow by strolling through a & CD; shop, physically or online.
In & kaudiocreator; you have to actively check a box to enable smtp (sending of an address) and you can specify a different (faked) address to use with freedb other than the one the system is set up with. The way the configuration is designed, it seems, that the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server. (But I am not the programmer, have n't checked the code.)
There are mirrors of the master database in many countries. When you set up & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, please use the mirror nearest to you. This saves bandwidth on the net and balances the load between the servers.
Visit freedb. org to get an up-to-date list of mirrors for online retrieval of & CD; information every time you rip a & CD; or to download the full database or (usually monthly created) updates of the database.
What ripper (program) is used to extract the songs from the & CD; into wav files on my computer?
Well, I have n't scanned the source but rumor has it, that cdparanoia is used for that. That has always been the best choice for ripping audio & CD; s. Note, that you have to install the cdparanoia package from your distro, if it is n't already.
You can choose the encoder and therefore the file format you want to turn the ripped wav files into. On first opening you will find pre-defined entries for lame (mp3s), oggenc (oggs) and flac (a lossless compression audio format) on the encoder setup tab. But you can add other encoders on that tab as well.
Note, that you have to install the encoder package from your distro for the encoder you want to use first, before you can use the encoder. (That's required even for the pre-defined encoders!). Take a look at the What encoder chapter for more information about encoders.
After installation of an encoder you can get more information about its switches by typing something like lame -help or lame --help in a console (eg; konsole). While'lame 'has to be replaced by the name of the encoder you installed.
There are many possible reasons for that. Check the & CD; /DVD drive device ID setting, access/ read permission and whether you have installed cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for mp3s, oggenc for oggs, flac & etc;). Try invoking both programs from a command line in a terminal. That might give you a hint what's wrong.
Check if you do n't try to rip a copy protected audio & CD;. Verify it on the cover of the & CD;. This wo n't work!
There is a chapter with a full walkthrough example. Even if you want to use different settings it might give you a hint how to proceed.
Do you have read the complete handbook, understood everything and somehow still unsure what to do? Well, no problem, follow this step by step example and you will get enough information to adjust just those areas which will the program make do exactly what you want.
In this example we will start the program for the first time, set everything up and rip our first & CD;. We will use lame '--preset extreme 'to create mp3s with a VBR (Variable Bit Rate) of 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 tags.
You need to have cdparanoia and lame installed on your system. Both programs should be available as a pre-compiled package for your linux distribution. However, you might need to ask a search engine to find a suitable package of lame, as sometimes it is considered to be not totally free. In any case you might not need to compile from source which, of course, you always can.
Please make sure, that the folder / usr/ share/ cd exists and that you have write permission on it (eg; try to copy something to it with konqueror).
the first covering the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something you might only do once and
the second describing the process of actually ripping a & CD;, which you will have to repeat for every & CD; you rip.
Here we set the encoder to use to compress the music (lame) and so the audio file format (mp3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = > VBR 224 to 256 kbps). You define where the files will go and what structure will be used to store them. We set the program to use freedb to get the & CD; data via Internet as we are lazy.
While you can always change any of these settings, you will most likely do n't change them every time you rip a & CD; once you found a convenient setup.
The device ID is parsed to the ripper program so it can read the & CD; data/ songs.
Often / dev/ cdrom is a symlink to the actual device ID from your drive. If that does not work or you have more than one & CD; /DVD drive, you can give the exact device ID. If you can access your drive with other programs, take a look into / etc/ fstab and try the device entries for & CD-ROM; and or DVD-drives listed there.
The General Configuration tab. There is not much to do here. You could define some additional formatting though. For our example, just enter/ leave everything as shown in the screenshot.
Just check Prompt if information is not complete, so you will get informed when some infos for generating tags are not available.
The CD; Configuration tab. Just check both entries. We are lazy and want that the & CD; data is fetched automatically via the Internet from a freedb server.
Note, you need to be online when ripping the & CD; to be able to access the freedb server.
The second box is convenient, as if a & CD; entry is found, the & CD; will be ripped immediately. That's low risk, because if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory/ file names or tag entries, you can easily change them. The folder and file names with konqueror- > rename and the id3 tags with kid3, the & kde; tagger.
Further note apart from this example: If you want to enter everything manually uncheck the boxes and freedb will not be used. You can use freedb locally in off-line mode if you download the database before. However, this will be over 620 MB so think twice if it's worth it. To use freedb in off-line mode, you need to check the boxes here, at least the first one. The mode is set on the following tab.
CDDB, that's freedb for us. The settings used for the data lookup, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server via the Internet. How does the system know what data to get? Read the section about freedb. Just set everything as in the screenshot.
Mode: We have n't downloaded the database, so we want to work remote with the Internet server only.
CDDB Server: Please go to freedb. org and look up a mirror near you. This way the load is balanced between the mirror servers. However, as a first try, this setting should work.
Both work equally regarding the server, but as many firewalls are blocking Port 8880 by default, you may have better luck with Port 80, as the & HTTP; port is usually open for browsing the Internet.
In this example we do n't want to submit any & CD; data to the freedb server. Uncheck the first box and that should it be.
Just take the settings from the screenshot. (If you do n't choose the standard folder / tmp make sure that the folder exists on your system!)
Number of tracks to rip at a time: sorry, cannot think of a reason to do more than one with one drive? Reading and encoding parallel? Just do n't know, try for yourself.
Auto-eject & CD; after last track is ripped: check this to eject the & CD; after the end of the process.
Use Custom temporary directory: If you check this, you can/ must specify the path/ folder where the wav files are ripped into. This might be handy if you only have space on another drive. If not checked the files will be created in your home folder. Remember this path if you want do something with the wav files themselves.
Enter everything as in the screenshot. The command entry is a bit long, so you may have to scroll a bit to the right.
'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the mp3s. As mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, sufficient even for very good HiFi Stereo systems. The resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 kbps in average. The achieved compression factor is 6.3. A good balance between audio quality and space consumption.
Note the '--id3v1-only 'entry to limit the tag creation to V1/ V1.1 tags. Delete it if you want id3v2 tags as well. kid3 is a very good id3 tagger for & kde; in case you want to manipulate tags later. %f and %o should be the internal variables for the input file (incl. the full path) and the output file name (incl. the full path).
Set the rest as in the screenshot. A few comments for future use outside this example:
Number of wav files to encode at a time: If you have a dualcore or quadcore machine or even a multi-processor machine, you can try to encode more than one file at the same time.
That's about it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;. This configuration is used as the default for every & CD; rip. If you have chosen your music organization structure wise you will never have to change it again.
This section will describe the process of ripping a & CD; onto the harddrive. We will create mp3 files. The folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described and setup in the previous section. So connect to the Internet now, as we are lazy and want to fetch the & CD; data from freedb! The process described in this section has to be repeated for ever & CD; you want to rip.
As we use a & CD;, which is not already listed in freedb, the screenshots might look a bit different as the ones you will encounter for a & CD; which could successfully fetched from freedb. Therefore you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually rather than fetching it from the Internet but comments will be made to point out the differences.
Do n't try too hard to look for the & CD; we use in this example. It's a'special 'handbook-writer edition.
If you have n't done so far, insert the & CD; into the drive which device ID you specified here on this main window.
After a short moment the tracks and their length should be listed on the window, as in the screenshot. That is, if the & CD; could be identified as an audio & CD; and read by cdparanoia.
If that's not happening, check the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section covering the basic setup.
Attention: if the & CD; could successfully fetched from freedb, all song titles will already be filled out and above the track list, the artist and album name will be shown.
In case that there are more than one entry in the database which matches the'unique '& CD; key for your & CD;, a popup window will appear and you can select the database entry which you think fits best for your & CD;.
If you have not checked the box for automatically querying freedb (CD; Configuration page in the settings dialog), you can trigger this manually with the first button from the button bar. If you do n't have a local database but fetching from the Internet you need to be connected to the net.
E 1.2 Step 02: The Album Editor - Enter the album data and the first song title
Enter the album data for your & CD; according the pattern in the next screenshot. The song title in the Track 1 row of the Current Track box, the rest of the & CD; data in the Album box.
No need to enter the artist in the Current Track box, unless of course, you have a sampler with different artists for each song.
The lower comment field can be used for individual comments for each song, where as the Album comment field can be used for comments which should be the same across all songs.
Attention: of course, when you have successfully fetched the data from freedb the Album Editor is not empty but already holds the data as shown in the following screenshot. However, it is always a good idea to open the Album Editor once to check whether you are happy not only with the artist and album name (e. g. all words start with capital letters or not...) but to check if there are any unwanted comments.
Note: In this example we are using only id3v1 tags. This limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and song title and only 28 characters for the comment field. If you want to create id3v2 tags, you can use unlimited field length, well, at least what & kaudiocreator; allows here. Have n't checked. You set this option on the encoder configuration tab, take a look into the Basic Setup section for this.
You can change the tag information of the created files later at any time with a tag editor. Kid3 is a good one for mp3 files with which you can create id3v2 tags, too.
Tags may not be supported by all encoder/ file formats. Check the encoder help for more information about this.
Just choose one of the entries which seems to match the style of the & CD; you rip. It's not important for this example, we do n't submit the & CD; data anyways. For more info go to freedb. org and read about the categories. Pop or Rap for instance are listed under Rock.
After hitting OK, you come back to the main window again. Just double click on the row of the second track.
Again the Album Editor window pops up and you can see, that the Album box is already filled out with the data we entered for the first track. So just enter the field entries in the Current Track box. The song title for sure and other information if you want.
Click into the next row on the main screen and proceed this way until you entered the track data for all tracks on the & CD;.
Attention: this popup will not show up, if you have fetched the data from freedb. It was already sorted into one of these categories in the database.
It's the 3rd button on the toolbar. Note, that the artist and album is shown above the track list.
Further note, that there is a check sign in front of every track row. Only the tracks which are marked that way will be processed. A single click on the track row will toggle the track selection. Ensure, that all tracks are selected or use the button Select All Tracks at the bottom of the screen (not shown on screenshot) to select all tracks at once.
Once you have started the ripping process by clicking on the Rip Selection button, this confirmation window pops up. Hit OK and then we will take a look at the jobs window to follow what's going on.
Hit the Jobs tab to switch to the jobs window. It's on the upper left of the screen, right under the toolbar with the buttons.
That's the job control window. The first track is just ripped to the hard disk. A program status is shown on the lower left screen in the status row.
You will see this error message when you try to encode with/ invoke an encoder which you have n't installed yet. Tracks that could not successfully encoded will get marked with a red'x 'on the job list, too.
By the way, the path for the tmp file and the destination path is not what we set up here in the example. So have you checked that you have write access to both, the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)
Now it becomes clear, why the error occurred just after the rip of the first song was finished.
Job one, ripping the first track, is gone (finished) but we have a new entry: Job 4 which is the encoding of track 1 to mp3. So ripping and encoding is done parallel. See the status message on the bottom of the window, it's enhanced now.
I could not find a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. The only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel rips and encodings. I do n't know, what this means on lower end machines. The AMD64 used here did n't seem to have a problem ripping and encoding a track (two different though) at once.
Now we are ripping the last track while encoding another one and having one in the encoder queue. After the last track is encoded, a small pop up message is shown on the upper left of the window for a short time.
In order to successfully use & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 4. x. and cdparanoia. If you want to create compressed audio files like mp3s or oggs, you need the encoder of your choice.
& kaudiocreator; is today maintained within the & kde; SVN as part of the extragear multimedia package. If you are familiar with svn you can do an anonymous checkout from there. However, most distros come with a pre-compiled package, especially because & kaudiocreator; is part of a main & kde; package. Install the extragear multimedia package from your distro. If you read this, you have most likely found it already...
Well, this section is most likely intended for people who build from source and not the user using a pre-compiled package from a distro.
If you look for help to configure the program to your needs once it is running, then the following is for you:
Being a program that can invoke many different other programs there is a lot to configure. Best read the full walkthrough example to introduce yourself with the configuration options. It sports screenshots of the different configuration tabs and provides comments even for options not used in the example.
Hey, still reading? Even if you just punched the help menu entry after opening the program the first time, not having a clue how to proceed from this somewhat empty screen (especially when no audio & CD; is already in the drive when starting the program) and the unusual short menu?
What are we talking about? Well you read this, so you have most likely started the program already. It should look somehow like this:
As a bad example: sorry no mail. I cannot maintain this handbook. It is thought as a first starter for a handbook for & kaudiocreator;. Whoever may think of something useful to add or change, may do so. Well, at least after contacting the author first, I assume. And if you read this, he left this section in and therefore agrees to this proposal.
Funny, if you managed to checkout the source from the & kde; SVN you wo n't need this info here but...
& kmid; is & kde; 's midi and karaoke multimedia player. It features some features not found in any other & UNIX; midi player, such as realtime graphics and karaoke text highlighting among others.
& kmid; has been reported to run on & Linux; and FreeBSD operating systems. It uses the OSS sound driver, so it should run on every system where & kde; and OSS compile. & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound Project Driver, which is required to get sound in GUS cards. I plan to support the ALSA driver as soon as it supports a sequencer device.
& kmid; shows the lyrics in the screen changing its color at the same time the music is playing, so it is very easy to follow the tune of the songs.
It features a graphical view of what is being played on each midi channel, by highlighting the keys pressed in (virtual) keyboards.
Drag & drop so you can drop in & kde; any midi file from a & konqueror; window.
Supports the two standards to introduce lyrics in midi files, that is, lyrics or text events (and guess which one a song uses automatically).
Session Management. If a song is playing while you logout from & kde;, the next time you login, the same song will start playing.
Supports external midi synths, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd installed).
First, you can select Open... from the File menu, then you are presented with a standard open dialog, with which you can select the song you wish to open.
You can drag a file from a & konqueror; window and drop it in the & kmid; window. You can also Drag & Drop multiple songs at the same time.
To play a song, first open it, and then press on the Play button of the toolbar, choose the Play entry of the Song menu, or just press the Space key.
Note that when you open a file using Drag & Drop, & kmid; will start playing it automatically (if you drop more than one file, they will be added to a collection and they will be played sequentially).
Once & kmid; is playing a song, you can move the time slider, by pressing with the & MMB; mouse button, to go to a specified position.
If a song is playing too fast or too slow for you, you can press on the arrows at both sides of the tempo LCD and make it play faster or slower. To get back to the default tempo, just do a double click on the tempo LCD.
The Space key is used for two things, when music is playing, and you press the Space key, it will act as when you press on the pause button or the Pause entry of the Song menu, that is, it will pause music. If you press the Space key when no music is being played, & kmid; will play it.
There are two methods to store lyrics in a song, by using Text events or Lyrics events, some songs use the first, some the second, some use both of them, and some do n't include lyrics: -)
& kmid; lets you choose which events to display, and even better, it has an option to automatically select the type of events that a song uses, so that you do n't have to change the type manually. That way, if you activate the Automatic Text Chooser entry of the Settings menu, the karaoke text will be automatically selected, but you can still change them if you prefer to see the other type.
To select which type to see, you can use the appropriate entries in the Settings menu, or just press the 1 and 2 keys of your keyboard to see the Text events or Lyrics events respectively.
A collection is a list of midi files that you put in a set, and which are played one after another. This section will help you to use them, and will give you some useful tips to make a good use of them.
To create a collection, first open the Collections Manager dialog, by selecting the Organize... entry of the Collections menu. Then click on the New button, and enter the name you want the collection to have.
You can also copy a complete collection by selecting it and then pressing the Copy button, which will ask you for the name of the new collection that will have initially the same songs as the selected collection.
Once you have more than one collection, you can change the active collection from the Collections Manager, by selecting it.
The Temporary Collection is a collection that is used to hold songs you want to play but that you do n't want to add to any collection.
This collection is not saved on exit of the application, so keep it in mind when you add lots of songs to it.
First of all in each method, you must have selected the collection you want to add songs to in the Collections Manager. Then you can press on the Add button to add a song, there will appear an open file dialog so that you can choose which song to add.
The other methods to add a song depend on the state of the AutoAdd to Collection option.
If AutoAdd to Collection is enabled, when you open a song (using File Open... or Drag & Drop) it (they) will be added to the active collection without user intervention.
If AutoAdd to Collection is not enabled, when you open a song the Temporary Collection will be activated and cleared, and the opened songs will be added to it.
To delete a song from a collection, just open the Collection Manager, select the appropriate collection, and the song you wish to delete, and then click on the Remove button.
You can select the order in which songs will be played. When you select In order mode from the Play Order submenu of the Collections menu, songs will be played in the same order in which they were added to the collection.
The random list in which the collection will be played will be regenerated each time you add or remove a file in the active collection, and when you press on the Shuffle mode entry of the menu.
You can select a song to play in the Collection Manager, or by using the combo box over the karaoke text.
You can also change to the next song by using the Next Song entry of the Song menu, the Next Song button of the toolbar, or pressing the right arrow key.
To change to the previous song, use the Previous Song entry of the Song menu, the Previous Song button of the toolbar, or press the left arrow key of your keyboard.
To delete a collection, simply open the Collection Manager, select the collection you want to delete, and click on Delete. Easy, it is n't?
Please keep in mind that you cannot delete the Temporary Collection, but it does n't matter as it is not saved when you quit & kmid;.
This is totally needed if a synthesizer does n't understand the standard events (that is, if a synthesizer is not General Midi compliant), in this case, a midi map will translate General Midi events in the events that synthesizer understands.
For example you can make a midi map that converts all the Change patch to Bright Piano events, to Change patch to Trumpet events, and so when a song tries to play a piano, it will play a trumpet instead.
If you only have a sound card, midi maps are not needed because all the sound cards are GM compliant (this include AWE cards, GUS cards, FM devices and so on).
There is n't any program to generate midi maps, so you will have to edit a file by hand (using your favorite text editor).
A Midi map is a text file that keeps all the needed translations there will be made when playing music.
Each section must appear only once, except the KEYMAP section that can appear as many times as needed, provided that each appearance use a different TextID (continue reading for details).
DEFINE PATCHMAP... END DEFINE KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END DEFINE KEYMAP "Another Keymap"... END DEFINE CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END
You can see that the DEFINE word is used to specify which section is going to be started (except for OPTIONS), and END is put at the end of each section.
Please, do n't forget to send me your map file by email, so that future releases of & kmid; will include support for more non General Midi compliant keyboards.
This section is used to specify how patches are going to be mapped, from GM to your keyboard specs. The general usage is:
Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored, so GM patches are supposed to be in order (from 0 to 127), and so you are not allowed to change the order of the lines nor to omit any of the 128 instruments.
The optional AllKeysTo M is used to map all notes that use that instrument to the M key. For example, suppose that your midi keyboard does n't have a Gun Shot sound (GM patch 127) so you want to map it to a percussion drum (i. e. key 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot, then you can put in the 127th line of the PATCHMAP section:
So when a midi file tries to play a note with the patch 127 (gun shot), it will be mapped to the patch 100 (your keyboard's percussion patch) and play the note 60 (independently of the key that was going to be played).
Please note that when I use the expression Percussion patch, I mean the patch in which each key plays a different drum, cymbal, tom, maracas and so on, and not to a possible sound which some keyboards have and which plays a different tone of the same drum with each key.
The KEYMAP section is used to specify how keys are going to be mapped, within a given channel or instrument. The usage is:
As with the PATCHMAP section, it is very important the order of the lines, and that they are all there (the 128 keys).
As you can define multiple keymaps for different channels and instruments, you must give a different name to each one in the first line.
Keymaps are mainly used to map keys in the percussion channel. Have a look at the distributed maps to see some examples.
This section can be used to map some channels to different ones. For example, if you want to swap the first and second channels, you can easily do it within the CHANNELMAP section.
However it is more useful for keyboards that need the percussion channel to be in a given channel (the GM standard use the channel 10, others use the channel 16 and others use channel 9).
Note that midi devices use 16 channels, so the CHANNELMAP section, has 16 lines, from 0 to 15, as this one:
Where N is the channel which is mapped to the M channel. If the Keymap option is used, the Keymap with name Name will be used in this channel (this Keymap should be defined earlier in the map file!). If the ForcePatch option is used, all events that try to change the patch which is used in this channel will be ignored, and patch x will be used instead.
The ForcePatch option may be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.
The PitchBenderRatio r value, has the ratio by which pitch bender events will be multiplied. That is, when a midi file tries to send a pitch bender event with a n value, the real value that will be sent is n*(r/ 4096) (the 4096 value is for not having to put decimal points in the map file).
This is used because the GM standard says that when a midi keyboard receives a Pitch Bender event with a 4096 data value, it should bend the note to a higher one, but some midi keyboards try to bend the initial note by two or more higher notes (even an octave higher!) when they receive a 4096. This can be easily fixed by trying different values so that instead of sending a 4096, & kmid; sends the appropriate value.
To use a midi map, simply open the Midi Setup dialog by selecting the Midi Setup... entry of the Settings menu.
The Channel view is a window where you are shown a heap of keyboards (one for each midi channel). In these keyboards, the notes that are being played with each instrument are highlighted so that you can see what is each instrument playing.
You can use the Channel View to change the instrument that each channel is playing. In each channel there is a combo box where you can select it. Once you change it, the green button next to it will change to red to indicate that this is not the default instrument.
The Channel View has two different ways (for now) to display the played notes, you can select them from the Channel View Options... item in the Settings menu.
This shows the tempo in which a song is played, that is, the velocity of the song. The higher this number is, the faster the song will play.
You can also change the tempo of the song, so if a song plays too fast for you to follow the lyrics, you can make it play slower. To change the tempo, you can use the arrows that appear at each sides of the LCD.
A Midi file is a file that contains the information on how to play a song, that is, it contains simply the notes, the rhythm, velocity, & etc; This implies that the same midi file, when played in two different devices, can produce very different results, as well as a given staff can be played very differently by two different musicians.
Well, I cannot force anyone to use & kmid;, but a typical midi file occupies 50 Kb. while a typical mp3 file occupies 4 Mb. (and that is a 1:80 compression ratio: -). And with a good synthesizer device, you can get a comparable sound quality. Even more, with a midi file, you can change individual instruments, change the velocity of a song, & etc; so you have more overall control.
This can happen when you get a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid;. It happens because & kmid; was compiled without awe support. If it does n't work, then you must download a source code distribution (for example, from kmid; 's homepage)
I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but having to add the midi files one by one is not funny.
I agree, that's why & kmid; supports Drag & Drop. Just open, in & konqueror;, the folder you want to add, select all the files, drag them and drop them in & kmid;.
Be sure to set the AutoAdd to Collection option before, so that the files will be added to the current collection. If you do n't do this, files will be added to the Temporary Collection.
You can press the left arrow of the tempo LCD to make it play slower. Remember that you can do a double click on the LCD to get the default tempo.
I always keep a & kde; desktop with a & konqueror; window in my root midi folder, and & kmid; in this desktop (if playing a midi file) or sticky (if playing a karaoke file: -)). This way, when the active collection finishes, or I want to play some file, I just go to the & konqueror; window, select the desired files and Drag & Drop to the & kmid; 's window.
Suppose that you want to play some midi files, but do n't want to add them to any collection, well, just turn off the AutoAdd to Collection option in the Collections menu, and open the files, they will be added to the Temporary Collection.
Suppose that you have midi files A. mid, B. mid and C. mid. At first you only want to play the first midi file, so you unselect AutoAdd and open A. mid. You get then a Temporary Collection with only one midi file.
Then you decide to play also B and C, and make a collection with all them, what do you do?
These are some folks who have sent me midi files or a postcard, thanks to everyone! Hearing those songs and watching those postcards will keep me programming more and more on & kmid;.
& kmid; has been made by & Antonio. Larrosa. Jimenez;, in Maacute; laga (Spain). I am a student of Mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga, currently I am doing the third course, so I do n't have much free time for my hobbies, but I always try to get some: -). My hobbies include: Programming, collecting midi files, playing music and proving theorems; -).
If you want to know where to download midi/ karaoke files, you have any question, a bug to report, an idea or a feature you'd like to see in & kmid; or just want to make me happy, feel free to send me an email to: larrosa@kde. org or antlarr@arrakis. es
You will really make me happy if you send me a postcard from where you live, or a midi/ karaoke file from a local music group of your country. Everyone who sends me a postcard or a midi file will have his/ her name in the Hall of & kmid; 's friends of this file (provided they do n't oppose to this). Please contact me before sending me any midi files because I may have it already.
I'd like stress that & kmid; has been done completely on free time, without any monetary support from any company nor particular. So please keep in mind when you use it, that the only think that keep me working on this is getting some feedback from its users (a postcard, or just an email).
Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Buehler - Fix for AWE cards pitch being too high
Thanks go also to Jose Luis Sanchez for his testing of GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Hans Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and everyone that sent me a patch, bug report or just an email to give me encouragement.
And of course to all the fabulous musicians over the net that keep giving us those wonderful midi and karaoke files.
Additionally, & kmid; can be found on its homepage, which is at http: / /www. arrakis. es/ ~rlarrosa/ kmid. html. In the homepage, you can follow its development, see some information about it, some screenshots, a list of sites from where you can download more karaoke songs, & etc;
A sound card. A good soundcard and/ or external synthesizer are recommended, as the sound quality depends greatly in your soundcard, it's not the same to play the music using an FM device, than using an AWE card.
If you do n't have a soundcard, you can still compile & kmid; with MODE_DEMO_ONLYVISUAL defined and it will run as if you had one (but you'll get no music, of course: -().
If you run into any problem, do n't hesitate to contact any of the & kde; mailing list, or send a report directly to me.
& kmplayer; is a simple frontend to MPlayer, Phonon and FFMpeg. You can use it for watching all the movie file formats that MPlayer, or Phonon supports as well as watching from DVD, VCD or TV and camera.
The documentation for & kappname; was not finished when & kde; was installed on this computer.
If you need more help, please check The KDE Website for updates, or by submitting your question to The & kde; User Mailing list.
The application window is made of so called dockable windows. There is always the central view window. Optional there is the playlist window. And finally there is an info window, that just shows itself when some information is there to been shown.
It's possible to store your favorite links in the Bookmark menu, but those are single items. If you want to create a list of items that play after each other, than you should use the Persistent Playlists category.
Of course you can add groups to groups to get a deeper hierarchy. When clicked on an item, its group and all its child groups will be copied to the current category and playings starts at the clicked item position.
The current, Television and Persistent Playlists categories can also be manipulated by editing their XML storage. Of course one can do that when & kmplayer; is not running and editing the various files in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ kmplayer/, but also in the application itself. Simply click on a category label, then choose View and next Edit mode. You can also click on a child branch and will then see only the XML contents of the branch.
After you have edited some XML, click on the Sync with playlist and either deselect the Edit mode item or click on another catergory.
All changes are lost when leaving edit mode or selecting another branch without syncing with playlist.
Because of the lazyness of & kmplayer; 's author(s), some features can only be enabled by editing the XML.
Disabling the starting/ ending animation can be configured by editing ~/. kde/ share/ config/ kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro=0 the above option to '1 '. Just add this option if it's not there yet.
It's also possible to set an alternative animation. & kmplayer; will look at resp. ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ kmplayer/ intro. xml and ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ kmplayer/ exit. xml. The format has to be a supported XML file.
The intro animation does n't have to be a short one, because it will automatically end when another source is opened. Of course for the exit animation this would be a bit annoying, however the user can always end the application twice.
A simple example of an intro, showing your favorite photo can be & lt; smilgt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; img dur="indefinite "src="file: / // home/ koos/ mum. gif" fit="meet"/ gt; & lt; /bodygt; & lt; /smilgt; In & kmplayer; 's source package, in the tests/ are some examples of SMIL that & kmplayer; supports.
There is a configuration tab for MPlayer in & kmplayer; 's config dialog. Here you can set MPlayer's path and it cache size for network stream, among other things.
Another debugging tool is the'console 'button in kmplayer's toolbar. Here you can see the output from mplayer.
There is no configuration tab for this player in & kmplayer; 's config dialog. Everything must be configured by manually editing the ~/. kde/ share/ config/ kmplayerrc like with configuring the backend per mimetype. This is an example how to let flash be played with the swfdec-mozilla plugin:
You can play flash inside & kmplayer;, actually you can even paste the special embed field for YouTube in the playlist XML.
In order to let & kmplayer; play flash in HTML pages, you should make the & kmplayer; plugin the service provider for the application/ x-shockwave-flash mimetype in KDE's File Associations configuration dialog.
Start Konqueror or & kmplayer; in a console application and look for errors about loading the browser plugin library. The process started is called knpplayer. If that does n't give any errors, check the backend output capturing inside & kmplayer; (View, Console, or Console from the popup menu).
To configure to always use a given backend for a particular mimetype (if detected of course) can be done by manually editing the ~/. kde/ share/ config/ kmplayerrc. For example, let phonon play all ogg files:
& kmplayer; can play from TV cards using MPlayer or XVideo (using kxvplayer). Before you can watch TV, you have to configure which device to use and the TV channels. You can use the scanner from the configure dialog for this or edit the config file manually.
To configure your VDR settings in kmplayer, see the Configure panel- > Source- > VDR- > XVideo port panel. There should be ports detected, from which you should select one. You have to figure out what encoding you should use (eg. for western europe, that is PAL) and likely the correct one has a name with dvb in it.
Because VDR support from kmplayer can only use XVideo, of course XVideo should work (and I believe for video devices, this way of viewing only works on linux). Also this only works on your first display (:0.0). So make sure videoforlinux extension works with the X server. For the XFree86 server, therefore in its configuration (/ etc/ X11/ XF86Config) it should have
Internally for the sources, & kmplayer; uses distinct names. At the time of this writing these are "dvdnavsource", "dvdsource", "exitsource", "introsource", "pipesource", "tvscanner", "tvsource", "urlsource", "vcdsource" and "vdrsource". When activated, they mostly starts playing the list of playable items.
Any hints to make my CDROM less noisy when playing from it (not VCD: / /)?
Sure, try hdparm -E 8 / dev/ cdrom as root after mounting the device. But be sure to double check / dev/ cdrom pointing to your CDROM drive.
Xine starts up slow, why does it have to benchmark my CPU all the time?
Note the answer below is outdated. kxineplayer saves it automatically to last value, so only the first time xine will do the CPU test.

gopher began as a distributed campus information service at the University of Minnesota. Gopher allows the user to access information on Gopher servers running on Internet hosts.
Gopher permits the user to record an item's location in a bookmark thereby allowing users to follow a bookmark directly to a particular item without searching the menu system. Gopher menus are not standardized, inasmuch as each Gopher server is individually determined.

Qt;: & Qt; is a C++ & GUI; and network library needed to compile & kile;.
latex;: high-quality document typesetting program. Most likely you want the & texlive; (or on older systems the & tetex;) package, if you are on a Unix-like system.
Most of these items might be included in your & Linux; distribution; please refer to your distribution documentation, or refer to your installation & CD; or DVD, for adding these packages to your computer.
The & kile; project includes several binary packages of & kile; for different distributions that can be easily installed and run without having to compile; check out the kile; homepage.
This manual is intended for any individual, regardless of her or his experience with & latex;, & kde;, & kile; or & Linux;.
Advanced users are not likely to read this manual, but all suggestions on documentation will be considered. If you would like to contribute to this project or the documentation, please consult the kile; web page.
Need answers about & kile;? Are you stuck with your compile? Want to see a new feature? The preferred way to ask technical questions or start a discussion is to use our mailing list: kile-devel@lists. sourceforge. net.
& kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; desktop. & kile; gives you the ability to use all the functionalities of & latex; in a graphical interface, giving you easy, immediate, and customized access to all programs for & latex; codecompletion, compiling, postprocessing, debugging, conversion and viewing tools; you also get very handy wizards, a & latex; reference and a powerful project management.
& kile; is based on & kate;, so a lot of editing capabilities come from & kate; and & kile; extends these capabilities to edit & latex; documents. To learn more about & kate; and its capabilities, see the kate; Handbook. & kile; users should start reading from the chapters Working with the & kate; Editor and Configuring & kate;.
Last, in & latex; the first L A is pronounced as lay: the idea is that, while raw & tex; is difficult, even a lay man can use & latex; macros. A less inspiring, but more realistic explanation is that it stems from the surname of Leslie Lamport, the creator of & latex;. Now you know!
While we will try to give you a good idea of what & latex; is, this is not The Definitive Book on & latex;. If you want to learn & latex; well, you may want to loan a book in your library. The writer has had a good experience with A Guide to & latex; by H. Kopka and P. W. Daly, and still keeps it on the shelf.
As other markup languages, & latex; contains a preamble, which sets global commands, such as paper size, page numbering, dimensions of the text on the page, and a body, that contains the document text; the preamble contains at least the \\documentclass command, and precedes the body, that starts with the command \\begin{document}, and is quite predictably concluded by the command \\end{document}.
The QuickStart wizard built into & kile; is a useful feature to quickly start creating documents in & kile;. Choosing the wizard from the menubar gives you several choices for the creation of your document. You can also specify some options related to the document right away.
Document Class: choose the type of document you want to create: article, book, letter, report, scrartcl, scrreprt, scrbook, prosper, beamer or other custom-defined.
Encoding: In general it is a good idea to use your systems standard encoding. Modern systems now move more and more to UTF-8 as the standard encoding. If you can, use utf8x (which is indeed the correct spelling for & latex; documents).
This lists some of the most common additional packages used in & latex;. Select the check box to include it.
Scrartcl, Scrbook, Scrreprt, Scrlttr2: the KOMA-Script document classes, especially adapted to german typography. Use them whenever you write german texts.
New users need not to worry, this list is just a brief description of features, and more attention will be paid to complete these tasks in detail later in.
& kile; is similar to programs that deal with source code and editing, and will automatically highlight commands, options and items that are used (and abused). & kile; makes it possible to spot easily problem areas: for example, if you see major areas of text turned green, it is likely that you forgot closing a math environment somewhere; you would have noticed anyway by how crappy the output file would have looked, but highlighting really saves you time and frustration.
The auto-completion of environments means that, when you begin a new environment by typing \\begin{environment}, & kile; will automatically insert a matching \\end{environment} command, with a line in between them for your text. You can of course deactivate it if you want in Settings Configure Kile... LaTeX Environments.
All documents are normally structured in a hierarchy of some type. & latex; allows you to break up documents into the following hierarchy (part being highest in the hierarchy, and subparagraph being lowest):
When viewing a document in the Structure view, you can jump between elements by clicking on the element you would like to view.
When creating your own & latex; files, inverse search can be very helpful. Once you have created a & DVI; file (DeVice Independent File), you can click the middle- mouse button in the & DVI; viewer and & kile; will jump to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.
A & DVI; is a type of file containing a description of a formatted document, along with other information including character font, and is besides PDF the usual output of & tex; or & latex;. A number of utilities exist to view, convert and print & DVI; files on various systems and devices.
When using inverse search, the selection of items in the & DVI; file is associated with the editor, so when you click on the & DVI; file, the main window jumps to the corresponding section of & latex; code in the editor. Forward search is the exact opposite of this. Forward search will allow you to click on a specific section of text in the & latex; code, and jump to the associated position in the & DVI; viewer window.
Define document as master: this is used when working with multiple files. Having a master document will let you work more easily with other. tex files included in your document. If you are using projects, you can also set in Project- > Project Options a project-wide master document.
Quickbuild: compiles your & latex; source code and displays the results automatically, unless you have code errors.
Watch file mode: this mode will "watch" the & DVI; file for changes, and will not launch a new session of & okular; after Quickbuild.
If you look at the Edit toolbar, you will notice three large drop-down menus. The drop-down menus were designed for you to be able to quickly add certain common features into your document. The first drop down box is used for quickly dividing your document by parts, chapter, sections and so on; the available commands to add segments to your & latex; source code are:
The drop down box named label is used to insert items to your document such as indexes, footnotes, and references; the available commands are:
label: a command that produces a label for a chapter, a figure or another element.
ref: used to refer to a predefined label, which you can choose from a drop-down list.
When using cite, you are presented with a drop-down list of bibitems, but if you are using & bibtex; this will only work if the file belongs to a Project. For editing & bibtex; files the usage of specialised editors is recommended. The author has made good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. Of course you can also write the & bibtex; files by hand inside & kile;.
The last drop-down box labeled tiny is used to set the size of the text. You can set the size of the main text, of footnotes, and so on. The available commands are:
Users of & kile; have two choices when starting a new document: they can use the Wizard to begin a new document, select the type of document they would like to create and options such as font size, paper size, and so on; otherwise, they can write the code by hand.
The brackets that come after the command \\documentclass contain the options for the command. The option [12pt] sets the size of the font for your article; if you do not set the font size in the beginning, you can set it later in the text.
Once you have typed in the code example from the box above, you will need to compile your & latex; source code. The easiest way for you to compile & latex; is to use the Build menu, or using the Quickbuild button.
You have to save your source code before you can compile; & kile; will do this automatically for you.
If your document did not compile, check the log for errors. When using the Quickbuild key, the & okular; viewer should be launched automatically; if it does not, look at the log.
An environment is a segment of text that is managed differently than the rest of the document. For example, you create a report with font size 12, but you need to change your font size for a few sentences. The commands \\begin{environment}, \\huge and \\end{environment} will let you temporarily alter the text inside the environment commands to be size huge.
Changes are only effective from \\begin{environment} to \\end{environment}. There are no limits as how many changes you can make inside an environment.
There are many features you can add to your document that will make it more readable and user-friendly. You can add features such as specific fonts, bold, italics, underline & etc; to your document, and these commands will end with either an \\end command, or at the end of your environment.
\\begin{emph}: this command makes text italicized, and is valid until the code comes across a \\end{emph}, or another environment. To italicize one word in a sentence, you can use the syntax: this is \\emph{my} sentence.
\\quote: to create a quote inside your document; begin your quote with \\begin{quote} and end it with \\end{quote}.
Now that we have given you some background about how to write code using the & latex; markup language, we will show you how to create a document using & kile; step-by-step.
Once the wizard has entered text, do some customization to make the document more readable, add a minimum of one quote, some bold text, italics, and a verse to see the difference between the commands.
When you are done viewing your document, click the Editor View button or press Ctrl; E to return to the editor if you are using the embedded viewer, or close the viewer window if you are using a separate viewer.
Once you have created your & DVI;, you will be able to print your document, or change it into a & PostScript; or PDF file if you want. Experiment and have fun!
& DVI; stands for DeVice Independent file. These files are produced by & tex; or & latex; to be read by a driver of some sort on your computer. There are many different types of output that a. dvi can be sent to, such as a printer, & PostScript; or PDF file converter, or your computer screen.
To print a & DVI;, you can use the same process that you used to create your document earlier (see). At step 7, after clicking ViewDVI, select File Print in the viewer, and if you have your printer properly configured, you will be able to print the & DVI;.
The toolbar gives the options of Converting a & DVI; to other formats. Once you have created a & DVI; from your & latex; source code, you will be able to export it to a format of your choice using the toolbar buttons.
The forward search functions allow you to jump from your editor directly into the associated position of the & DVI; file.
& kile; offers a configuration with this option for all & latex; binaries. Go to Settings Configure Kile... Tools Build and always choose the Modern configuration.
To execute a forward search, position the cursor on a line of source code, and click Forward Search to jump to the associated position in the & DVI; viewer window.
With this feature of & okular;, a middle mouse click in the & DVI; document will result in & kile; opening the corresponding & latex; document and attempt to go to the corresponding line. Remember to tell & okular; to use & kile; as a text editor, in & okular; 's menu item Settings Configure Okular... (on the page Editor).
If you are trying to use quickbuild, and the & DVI; viewer does not open, chances are you have an error. If you have an error, it will be visible in the log file / message area, and the summary of the error will be given.
The log file will explain the source of the error in your code. In the editor, you can use the buttons in the toolbar labeled Previous LaTeX Error and Next LaTeX Error to jump to and from errors. The log file always states in which line the error occurred. To view the line where an error occurred, click on the error in the log window, and & kile; will take you to error's line.
When you click the button in the toolbar to begin a new document a dialog appears, asking which type of template you would like to use to write your document. The default choices are:
If you selected an Empty document, you can either start writing a document from scratch, or you can use the wizard to quickly start a new document (see).
Frequent users of & latex; typically use the same preamble for almost every document they use. Templates can be created, saved and loaded within & kile; to make it easier to start a new document.
To create a new template, you must first either open a & tex; / & latex; file, or create a file of your own. & kile; can generate a template from an existing document by opening the desired document and selecting File Create Template from Document.
When creating a new document by selecting a template from File New, certain character combinations will be replaced by data such as your name, or the character encoding your are using. These variables can be configured in Settings Configure Kile... Settings General.
When designing your own template, it is useful to known which character combinations are replaced by which template variables:
$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS$$: This string will be replaced by the documentclass options variable. Typically this is used as follows: \\documentclass[$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS$$]{article}.
The easiest way to create a new template is to start the wizard, and then add commands in the editor. Once you have your document set up the way you like:
Next time you start up a new document, you will be able to choose your customized template instead of the default ones.
A template can be created from any & latex; file. If you are looking for an easy way to configure a template, go find one you like on the Internet and follow the same steps listed in.
The internal editor that & kile; uses is & kate;. & kate; is a text editor created for programmers, which incorporates the ability to read and highlight many different types of text files, among which are & latex; and & bibtex;; you can access many options for & kate; directly from & kile; 's Tools menu.
To learn more about & kate; and its capabilities, see the kate; Handbook. & kile; users can start reading from the chapter Working with the & kate; Editor.
& kile; features a very practical & latex; tag reference, which you can access by choosing Help LaTeX Reference. It contains a thorough description of almost all the commands that you may use in & latex; and their syntax.
Click twice on a word and pressing Ctrl; to select the whole tex word. This means clicking in this way on \\par from \\par\\bigskip only select \\par.
Holding the left mouse button, and dragging the text you want to select, automatically copies the selected text to the clipboard.
Holding shift and using the arrow keys allows you to select portions of the source code in the editor window.
& kile; has the ability to look for and highlight different types of code. For example, & latex; commands are distinguished from normal text, and math formulas are highlighted also in a different color.
Many wizards can insert optional bullets, a special kind of bookmarks within the text. The menu entries Edit Bullets or the corresponding keyboards shortcuts will allow you to jump to the next or last bullet. This will also highlight this bullet so that it will be deleted automatically, when you enter your first letter.
Editing is of course one of the main aspects when you use a program like & kile;. Although & kate; already has great capabilities, & kile; adds some important features, which are especially needed to write & latex; source. & latex; always needs a lot of environments and groups, so & kile; supports very special commands to select them. Under Edit Select you will find the following commands to select text.
Select a whole paragraph, & ie; a group of text lines separated on both sides by empty lines. A paragraph does not mean just continuous lines of text, as it is in other text editors. This extended meaning also includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of source. The only important thing for & kile; is that kind of paragraph is separated by two empty lines.
Select the word under the current cursor position. This selection has also en extended meaning, because this command can also select & latex; commands, which begin with a backslash and may also have an optional star at the end.
To delete some parts of a document you can of course select them, and then use the Delete key. & kate; also offers the command Ctrl; K which deletes the whole line. But & kile; offers a faster way with its own delete commands. Under Edit Delete you will find following commands to delete text.
Delete a whole paragraph. Look at the Select Paragraph command, how a paragraph is defined in & kile;.
It was already mentioned that environments are a central point in & latex;. So & kile; offers five other commands to make the work with & latex; as easy as possible under submenus Edit Environment.
This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment, wherever your current position is. The cursor will be placed directly in front of the opening environment tag.
This command will jump to the end of the current environment, wherever your current position is. The cursor will be placed directly behind the closing environment tag.
When your cursor is placed in front of or above the \\begin{environment} tag, it will be moved to the opposite end of the environment and vice versa.
Typing a lot of nested environment tags, you may lose control of all those environments. This command will close the last opened environment, so that the nested structure of environments will not be broken.
& kile; also offers some special commands for & latex; groups, which are determined by braces {...}. In submenu Edit TeX Group you will find some important commands, which correspond to those from Edit Environment.
This command will jump to the beginning of the current group, wherever your current position is. The cursor will be placed directly in front of the opening brace.
This command will jump to the end of the current group, wherever your current position is. The cursor will be placed directly behind the closing brace.
When your cursor is placed in front of or behind an opening brace of a & tex; group, he will be moved to the opposite end of the group and vice versa.
Typing a lot of nested group braces may be hard work. This command will close the last opened group, so that the nested structure of & tex; groups will not be broken.
In & latex;, two single quotes are used as double quotes. To help you insert these efficiently, & kile; allows you to press "to insert two opening single quotes. Furthermore, if you want to close a quotation, you also have to press". & kile; will be smart enough to recognize this case and inserts two closing quotes for & latex;.
You can enable or disable this auto insertion of opening and closing double quotes in section Settings Configure Kile... LaTeX.
If you also include language-specific options like ngerman or french, you will also be able to use German or French double quotes. Many more languages are available.
If you press Ctrl; Return, & kile; inserts an intelligent newline. If your current position is inside a list environment, like enumerate or itemize, & kile; will not only insert a newline, but also add a \\item command.
If you are inside a tabular environment, & kile; will finish the current line with\\\\, followed by the newline.
Even better, & kile; is smart enough to support predefined & latex; and user defined environment, which can be added in section Settings Configure Kile... LaTeX.
Some users like to arrange columns in tabular environments and put all ampersand characters amp; beneath each other. & kile; tries to support this. If you press Alt; Shift; amp;, & kile; will look for the next tab in the row above. Although this tab may not the corresponding tab, & kile; will add some spaces to adjust the column position with the current tab.
Although & kate; already offers a good completion mode, & kile; extended code completion to support some special methods especially for & latex;. Five different modes are integrated. Three of them work on demand, the other two are autocompletion modes. All modes can be configured to work very differently at Settings Configure Kile....
When you begin a new environment, typing \\begin{environment}, & kile; will automatically add an \\end{environment} command, with a line in between for your text.
When you push the & Backspace; key, the last letter of your pattern will be deleted, and the completion list may grow. On the other hand, if you type another letter will expand the pattern and the visible word list may shrink.
You will see that all commands are written with a short description of their parameters. These descriptions are of course stripped when you select a command. Optionally you can let & kile; insert bullets at these places, so that you can easily jump to these positions with Edit Bullets Next Bullet and insert the parameter you want.
Go to Settings Configure Kile... Kile Complete to configure one or more of these lists. You can choose different word lists for & tex; and & latex; commands and dictionary mode for normal words.
The command mode is not useful to complete environments. You always have to type some letters of \\begin, and invoking the completion mode will result in a huge list of environments tags. On the other hand, environments are so often used that & kile; offers a special mode to complete environments. Forget the opening tag and write, for example, eq.
When you call the completion mode with Edit Complete Environment or keyboard shortcut Alt; Shift; Space, the opening tag is automatically added and you will see \\begin{eq}. After this change, the completion list is much less cluttered.
Now select an environment, and you will see that it is also automatically closed. Even more, if & kile; recognizes it as a list environment, it will also insert a first \\item tag.
Go to Settings Configure Kile... Kile Complete to configure one or more of these lists. This mode uses the same word lists as the completion mode for & tex; and & latex; commands.
& kile; supports user defined lists of abbreviations, which are replaced on demand by longer text strings. Look at Settings Configure Kile... Kile Complete to configure one or more of theses lists. For the example given here, the abbreviation list in example. cwl must be chosen. In this file you will find for example the entry L=\\LaTeX for example.
For example, type only the letter L. Now invoke the abbreviation mode of word completion with Edit Complete Abbreviation or keyboard shortcut Ctrl; Alt; Space, and the letter L is replaced by the string \\LaTeX.
Large dictionaries are not useful in autocompletion mode. But, we have seen that a lot of words in a document are typed more than once. So & kile; offers a completion for all words from the document that the user has already typed before. You can manually invoke this completion, if you press Ctrl; Space. Note that this mode is different from completion mode of & latex; commands.
If you want to turn this mode on or off, go to Settings Configure Kile... Editor Editing Auto Completion. In this configuration dialog you can configure, if completion mode for document words should be enabled. There is also an additional autocompletion mode, where a completion box pops up, when a certain threshold is reached.
Completion files can be installed in a user's home folder under the ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ kile/ complete/ lt; modegt; / subdirectory, where lt; modegt; either stands for abbreviation, dictionary or tex.
The Include Graphics dialog makes insertion of graphics as easy as possible. Please take a look at and to get an overview of some basic facts concerning graphic formats.
PS files are not so popular as PDF files, but are an excellent base for manipulations and rearrangements of pages. If you need PDF output, you can rearrange pages with some & PostScript; utilities and then convert it to PDF with ps2pdf.
To view the result of your work, you first need to compile the source. All the build tools are grouped closely together in the Build Compile, Build Convert, and Build View menus.
To compile your source code for screen viewers like & okular; or further conversion, you can use the shortcut Alt; 2. Then you can view the & DVI; file using your default viewer with Alt; 3, convert the & DVI; to a PS file with Alt; 4, and view the PS file with Alt; 5.
When you launch the Quickbuild command, a viewer of some sort will normally be called after the compilation. If you are not using an embedded viewer, a new window will be open every time.
To create a project, select Project New Project.... You will be asked to give the following information to create your project:
When you fill out the filename box, you have to include a relative path from where the. kilepr project file is stored to the file.
& kile; 's scripting feature allows for the execution of ECMAScript code. Scripts can be managed through the scripting panel in the sidebar.
Please note that the scripting API has not been finalized yet. The API described below might change in future versions of & kile;.
First of all, & kile; 's script execution environment provides a global object called "kile", which owns the following methods:
& latex; is a rather sophisticated system, where the basic features can be expanded by a great variety of additional packages. & kile; provides a lot of different help to support the user.
& tetex; /texlive; comes with a huge amount of documents. This includes a documentation for all included packages and an additional & latex; reference.
A full reference for & tex; and friends. This is not only a description of all programs, some important packages are also mentioned. And it includes a full reference manual of & latex; commandsmdash; ideal for looking up a particular piece of formatting while writing a document. As this document is really extensive, & kile; separates it with three important bookmarks.
It is not always easy to find the right document, as & tetex; /texlive; comes with a huge amount of documents. As one possible help, & tetex; /texlive; provides a tiny program texdoctk. It comes with a database of all documents that & kile; uses to offer an interface to it.
All documents are grouped into some categories, and the main advantage is that you can search for packages names or keywords. & kile; will then show only the results.
A mouse double click or the Space key will start the viewer for this document. This can be a arbitrary document, not only a & DVI;, PS, PDF or & HTML; document. & kile; will take & kde; settings to start a appropriate viewer.
& kile; is an open-source user-friendly & latex; / & tex; source code editor. It will run on systems with the & kde; Desktop Environment installed. & kde; is available for several architectures with & Linux; and other Unix-like systems installed. & kile; is also part of the Fink project, which means you can run & kile; on a & Mac; with OS-X.
Many thanks are owed to those who strive to continue the & kile; project, and the many hours of contributions made by those who sacrifice their time to develop tools we can all use under the & GNU; license. Up-to-date information about contributors can be found in the About & kile; dialog from the Help menu.

& ksig; is a graphical tool for keeping track of many different email signatures. The signatures themselves can be edited through & ksig; apos; s graphical user interface. A command-line interface is then available for generating random or daily signatures from a list. The command-line interface makes a suitable plugin for generating signatures in external mail clients such as & kmail;.
Random signatures will pull signatures from the & ksig; signature file randomly. You can make every email more exiciting and unique than the previous by creating multiple signatures with varying quotes, styles, and information.
Daily signatures will pull signatures from the & ksig; signature file only using one signature for an entire day. Every day will provide a different signature, and just like the random signatures provide uniqueness to your emails.
To create a new signature, go to Ctrl; N File New. This will create an lt; empty signaturegt; in the Signatures section. Left click the & lt; empty signaturegt; and in the bottom section type in your new signature. Signature example Mr. Konqi konqi@kde. org http: / /www. kde. org Once you have completed your signature, save it by going to Ctrl; S File Save, or by pressing the Save button (floppy disc icon).
You can create as many signatures as you would like. Doing so provides you with a list of signatures to use in email applications such as & kmail;, so no matter how informal or professional you need to be, there will always be an available signature.
To remove a signature first select the signature that you want to remove and then click File Remove, or by clicking the Remove button with the red x icon in the toolbar.
Displays the Configure Shortcuts dialog box. This lets you choose shortcut keys for various menu items. To change a shortcut, select an action from the list, and then choose which keystroke to use. Clicking on the bottom right Custom button lets you choose which specific key to use. Just press the new key or key combo.
In order to successfully use & ksig;, you need & kde; 3.5. To apply a signature to your emails you will also need a client such as & kmail; or any other client that can obtain the signature text from the output of a command.
All call stack items found are listed here. The older the callstack entry the lower the frame number it will have. See below for an example.
Clicking on a callstack entry in the list shown will cause the cursor in the main window to move to the file and line number indicated.
& kxsldbg; provides a graphic user interface front-end to & xsldbg;, which supports debugging of & XSLT; scripts.
& configure-section; & mainwindow-section; & inspector-section; & variables; & callstack; & templates; & sources; & entities; & tools-section;
If the inspector dialog is not showing use the Tools Show inspectors menu item. To work with entities click on the Entities tab of dialog shown.
All external & XML; entities included via the DATA file or one of its siblings are listed here. For this example I have run & kxsldbg; on testdoc. xsl with testdoc. xml (found in the lt; KDE PREFIXgt; /share/ apps/ kxsldbg folder so that you can see some entities.
Clicking on a entity entry in the list shown will cause the cursor in the main window to move to the start of the file indicated.
By using the... button to choose file desired. The XSL; source and XML; data may refer to URI that contains a http: / /, ftp: / / or file: / /. The Output file must refer to a writable local file.
To follow along with the examples, select the following files in the example lt; KDE PREFIXgt; /share/ apps/ kxsldbg folder
You can select zero or more options from the Options dialog. Each option has a tooltip with a hint on what effect it has.
You can add zero or more parameters via the LibXSLT Parameters section of dialog. This allows you to provide parameter values to the stylesheet.
For the changes you have made to take effect press the Apply button. To ignore any changes press the Cancel button.
You can close the dialog using the X provided at the top right of the window. If you need to change the configuration just re-open the configuration dialog as shown before.
Once you have started the style sheet, you can use the Tools Show inspectors menu item. Then click on the Breakpoints tab. See below for an example.
A file name may be absolute path to a local file. Or partial file (eg; xsldoc. xsl).
A template or mode name may is fully Qualified Name where the non-local part is optional & eg; xsl: mytemplate is matched by mytemplate
Firstly left mouse click the breakpoint you want to delete in the list of current breakpoints. Then click the Delete button.
The state of a given breakpoint is indicated via the relevant text with a different background color. You can choose the color desired: see the Settings Configure Editor dialog, on the Colors page.
You can set, disable or delete a breakpoint using keys, the Debug menu or the buttons on the tool bar.
Most of the output from & kxsldbg; is captured and presented either in the inspectors dialog or the & kxsldbg; output window. The exceptions to this rule are:
Several tools are available via the tools menu. The main tool is the inspector tool.
By clicking on Start execution with walking menu a dialog is shown to allow the walk speed to be chosen.
To stop walking either use the W key or select the Start execution with walking menu item.
To lookup a System ID in the current & XML; catalog use the Lookup System ID menu then enter the value to find the dialog that displays.
To lookup a PUBLIC ID use the Lookup Public ID menu entry then enter the value to find the dialog that displays.
If the inspector dialog is not showing use the Tools Show inspectors menu item. To work with sources click on the sources tab of dialog shown.
All & XSLT; source files that are included by the & XSLT; file or one of its siblings are listed here.
Clicking on a source entry in the list shown will cause the cursor in the main window to move to the start of file indicated.
If the inspector dialog is not showing use the Tools Show inspectors menu item. To work with templates click on the templates tab of dialog shown.
All templates found are listed here. Please note that the export rules of & XSLT; apply. So only there may be more than one template with the same match and mode details.
Clicking on a template entry in the list shown will cause the cursor in the main window to move to the file and line number indicated.
Local and global variables are show in a tab on the inspector dialog. The following example shows a XSLT code segment that declares a global and a local variable
Clicking with with mouse on a variable in the list will cause summary information to be displayed in the bottom of the dialog. If a variable has a select expression, for example
then a new XPath can be chosen by entering a new value for Variable expression then clicking the Set expression button.
Clicking on a variable entry in the list shown will cause the cursor in the main window to move to the file and line number indicated.
The 3.2 release of & quantaplus; brings with it many new & XML; tools and features. The tools are unique in their integration within & quantaplus;. All of these tools use Kommander as a front-end and libxml2 and libxslt as a back-end. The combination of these makes for fast, efficient, productive, and complete tools.
Anyone who has worked with & kde; documentation knows meinproc and how superb it is. Well, take it up a notch with a great graphical interface! No longer resort to a shell; just click the icon that resembles a processor and you are done!
This application expects an index. docbook file to be present in a folder. If index. docbook is in the current working folder, then simply leave Current Working Folder checked. If it is not, then uncheck Current Working Folder and enter the folder you wish to process in the Other Folder field.
Outputted files are placed in the same folder as the sources files. All & HTML; files are removed each time meinproc is ran.
Again, anyone who has worked with & kde; documentation knows this helpful application. Again, & quantaplus; provides a great little graphical front-end to this one.
If the currently opened file is the index. docbook file, then simply leave Current Working Folder checked. If it is not, then uncheck Current Working Folder and enter the folder of where index. docbook can be found.
If there is output, then your file is invalid. Please correct the reported errors and try again.
If the file to be validated is currently focused on in & quantaplus;, then simply leave Current File checked. If it is not, then uncheck Current File and select the file to be validated from the Other File file selector.
If you only wish to know only if the file is well-formed, click the Well-formed Checking Only check box.
If you are using a & DTD; and it is specified within the & XML; file, then select & DTD; (Internal) (default), else select & DTD; (External) and locate the & DTD; with the Definition & URI; file selector. Both & W3C; & XML; Schema and RelaxNG validation are required to be externally defined via the Definition & URI; file selector.
Yep, & quantaplus; has a & XSL; processing tool, too! This uses the xsltproc tool provided with libxml2.
If the file to be processed is currently focused on in & quantaplus;, then simply leave Current File checked. If it is not, then uncheck Current File and select the file to be processed from the Other File selector.
Enter the name of the file that you want the resulting file to be called. File is outputed to your home folder by default.
The plugins & quantaplus; loads might have nothing to do with & quantaplus; itself. This makes it a very powerful plugin system. You can benefit from extra functionality and need not to wait until someone integrates it into & quantaplus;! The plugins can be loaded into a number of & GUI; elements. More on this below.
To install a Plugin or KPart we will work from the Plugins Edit menu. This will bring up the following dialog:
This dialog lets you manage all defined plugins and lets you add new ones. We will describe each & GUI; element in here:
Here you can fill in a search path. When adding a plugin without a Location, & quantaplus; will search these paths to find the plugin.
Often a project has more than one people working on it and there is some kind of hierarchical relationship between them. & quantaplus; supports the notion of team members and they are configurable in the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.
The Name, Email entries are self explaining. Nickname is the nick of the user and acts as an unique identifier.
One member can have more than one role in the project, like both team leader and subproject leader.
The user should select who is himself from the list of the team members. This is possible by selecting a team member from the list and pressing the Set to Yourself button. The currently selected member (your identity) appears in bold after the You are: text.
Nicknames and setting yourself is important regarding messaging and annotations. See to learn more about annotations.
Aside of keeping track of your team, there is one more benefit of setting up the team members: you can configure an event to inform the team leaders when some action happens. See about how to do it.
Event actions are actions executed when some event happens in the project. An example would be logging when the project was opened and closed, so it can be later reviewed how much one worked on it, or sending a mail when a file is saved, or adding the file to the CVS with the help of a script when the file is added to the project and the list could continue.
On the Event Configuration page of the Shift; F7 Project dialog you can create, edit and delete the event actions.
an email is sent when the action happens to the recipient selected in the Receiver list. The recipient can be a team or subproject leader. See for defining such leaders.
Annotations are special comments in the documents. They differ from regular comments by the following things:
Entering annotations is simple. You can either use the Annotate entry from the editor context menu or enter the @annotation keyword in a comment area followed by the annotation text.
Annotations can be addressed for a specific member of your team. The syntax in this case is @annotation(nickname) or @annotation(role), where nickname is the nickname of a team member, while role is a project role from the following items: team leader task leader subproject leader The task and subproject leaders should be followed by the corresponding task and subproject name, like it is shown in the below examples.
Nicknames and role names are case insensitive, but spaces around brackets and the: make the annotation invalid.
& quantaplus; is a Web & IDE; that strives to be neutral and transparent to all markup languages, while supporting popular web-based scripting languages, & CSS;, and other emerging & W3C; recommendations.
The configuration dialogs are accessible from the Settings menu. Here we will discuss only few of them, the rest are not & quantaplus; specific and a short description can be found at.
The configuration dialog can be invoked by using Settings Configure Quanta.... The dialog has several pages, we will discuss them one by one.
You can change the behavior of & quantaplus; related to tags, including autocompletion. The entries are:
Tag case: the case of the automatically inserted tags. Default Case means the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.
Attribute case: the case of the automatically inserted attributes. Default Case means the attributes will be inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.
Auto-close optional tags: if checked, tags for which closing tag is option will be automatically closed once the tag closing & gt; is entered.
Auto-close non-single and non-optional tags: same as before for the rest of tags, exception being the single tags.
Update opening/ closing tag automatically: if enabled, whenever you change the opening tag, the corresponding closing tag will be changed as well and vice-versa.
Automatic replacement of the accented characters: if enabled the accented characters will be replaced with their codes as you type.
Mimetypes: mimetypes used to recognize different kind of files. Use the Reset to Default button to fill in the entries with the default settings.
Default character encoding: the encoding of the newly created files, or files loaded in other way than File Open (where you can override the encoding). This setting is overridden by the same setting in the Project Properties if a project is loaded.
Default DTD: the DTD used for newly created files, or files whose DTD was not recognized. This setting is overridden by the same setting in the Project Properties if a project is loaded.
Create backups: & quantaplus; will create backup files periodically, so in case of power failure or crash, on the next startup the document can be restored from this backup. This is not the same as the backup created on file save. Even for not-yet saved documents there is a backup created.
The preview and the documentation can appear in the editor area or in a separate toolview, in which case it's possible to look at the documentation/ preview and the source as well.
Reset window layout to the default on the next startup is useful when you have messed up the user interface by changing the MDI modes and docking/ undocking the toolviews. It is the same as the --resetlayout command line switch.
The Warning Messages section is useful to enable or disable the warning messages that can be dismissed by checking the Do not show again box in them.
The place to change the & VPL; behavior. You can enable the showing of an icon in place of scripts as well as configure the synchronization of the VPL and source view when the splitted mode is activated. See to learn how to activate the different modes.
Here you can fine-tune the parser and the structure tree, which is the visual representation of the parser nodes in the document.
In the Clicks on Structure Tree Items it is possible to change the actions assigned to mouse buttons when you click on the structure tree.
In the Structure Tree Look & Feel it is possible to configure what kind of nodes are visible in the tree, how often is the tree updated while editing and on an update how deeply should be the structure tree automatically opened. Empty nodes are the white-space text nodes, while empty groups are groups for whom there was no element found in the current document.
The place to define abbreviations (some kind of templates), that can be expanded to bigger text while editing. Abbreviations are organized in groups, each group can be valid for more than one & DTEP;. This means you can have a group valid for PHP where the "ifclause" abbreviation template means something else than in a group valid for JavaScript.
Here you can manage your plugins. Plugins are KPart applications written by third parties that can be reused in any KPart aware application, the most known being & konqueror;. When creating a plugin you must specify the:
Location: the path to the plugin, if it is not located in the standard locations, like $KDEDIR / lib.
Input: the plugin will get this information on startup, so it can open the Current File, the folder of the current file (Current File Path) or the Project Folder.
Read only part: check if the plugin refuses to load. Read-only KParts usually refuse to load without this option checked.
Validate plugin: if checked, & quantaplus; will test if the entered information is correct or not. Uncheck if the plugin is not yet available, but you will install later, so you can close the dialog.
With & quantaplus; version 3.3, the debugger handling was reimplemented. The support for the now obsolete & PHP; (3) builtin debugger and was dropped, as was the support for the dbg debugger. Instead, a general debug plugin system was developed, to allow different plugin implementations.
Currently only one plugin is available which adds support to use & gubed; with & quantaplus;.
To use a debugger for your project, open the project settings and chose a suitable debugger plugin. To alter debugger specific settings, press the'Options' button next to the debugger plugin drop down.
Once a project has a debugger activated, a few additional items will appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:
A toolview where the contents of watched variables is showed. Appears in the left dock by default.
A toolview where all the breakpoints, line and conditional, are listed. Appears in the bottom dock by default.
A toolview where the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. Appears in the bottom dock by default.
Depending on what the debugger plugin supports, all or a subset of the following functionality will be available.
This action is used to connect to the debugger if that is required, or tell the plugin to start listening for debug requests. This action is triggered by default when a project using a debugger is opened, so usually you do n't need to care about it.
The opposite of Debug Session Start Session. Closes a connection to the debugger or stops listening for requests.
Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. Using this action is equivalent to using a browser to look at the current document. The output of the request ends up in the Debug Output dock.
Tells the debugger to start executing the script and send information about watched variables and current line of execution as it goes along. If this is done while a script is paused, execution will proceed. If it's done before a debug request is initiated, the script will start running as soon as the request is initiated.
Tells the debugger to start executing the script without sending information about watched variables and current line of execution. If this is done while a script is paused, execution will proceed. If it's done before a debug request is initiated, the script will start leaping as soon as the request is initiated.
Tells the debugger to execute the next instruction in the script, without stepping into functions or inclusions.
Tells the debugger to execute the next instruction in the script, stepping into functions or inclusions if possible.
Tells the debugger to skip the next instruction and proceed to the next one as if the current one did n't exist.
Opens a dialog where you can enter a variable or expression you wish to watch. The value of the watch will appear in the variables tool view.
Opens a dialog where you can enter a variable and a new value for it.
& kxsl; is the creation of Keith Isdale, as is this section of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front-end and a KPart to xsldbg, which you can find at http: / /xsldbg. sf. net along with many other works by Keith.
This chapter describes how to customize & quantaplus; to your particular needs and how you can help & quantaplus; become better.
Document Type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to add support for markup, scripting languages, and & CSS;. They allow & quantaplus; to provide features like auto-completion and node trees. Their simplicity and flexibility are what make & quantaplus; a fast, developer friendly & IDE; for web developers. They are what make & quantaplus; an easy-to-use, productive environment.
& DTEP; s come in two flavors, Family 1, which are markups, and Family 2, which are scripting and & CSS;. & DTEP; s are made up of two parts, the Tag Folder and the Toolbars. Tag Folders are composed of two types of files, the & descriptionrc; and TagXML files, which carry the extension. tag. Toolbars are the handy, icon-oriented tabs of buttons (above the editing window) which place text into a document faster than the user can type.
& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. See for details about the conversion.
This document describes how to make TagXML files, the & descriptionrc;, and toolbars. In short, a & DTEP;.
TagXML files (. tag) define both the attributes specific to a tag and the layout and contents of the properties dialog & quantaplus; shows for the tag. The & descriptionrc; file provides rules and information on the & DTEP; itself. Toolbars provide a quick means for adding tags into a document without worry of mis-spellings and such.
Tag Folders are just that, folders. They are composed only of the & descriptionrc; and TagXML files. Tag Folders carry the name of the mark-up language and version, if applicable. (For example, html-4.01-strict)
The table below lists the elements defined in TagXML and declares whether they are required or not. While not all are required, it is recommended that you use as many as you can so that other users can have a better experience and more information to work with.
The following sections will describe, in detail, each element. Everything from where they can go to what goes in them is layed out in an easy-to-follow manner.
This is the root element of a TagXML document. It may appear in a document only once. It can contain the definition of multiple tags. This is an element-only type element.
Type of tag is a script function. When used, & lt; attr > becomes arguments of the function. (Family 2 only.)
Valid only if the type of the tag is "class". The name of the base class for this class. (Family 2 only.)
Valid only if the type is "method". Specifies the name of the class to where this method belongs. (Family 2 only.)
if "yes", the tag specifies a common attribute group and the attributes inside this tag can be attached to any other tag. (Family 1 only.)
Place a label in the dialog. The text is specified by the & lt; text > tag. This is an element-only type element.
Defines an attribute of the tag. This element occurs once for each attribute. It defines the name and type of attribute. It also contains additional tags that specify how this attribute should be displayed, et cetera. This is an element-only type element.
Specifies the sources used to fill the entry for the attribute in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree
Requires source="dcop ". The dcop interface from inside & quantaplus; used to get the source data.
Requires source="dcop "and an interface name. The dcop method name from inside & quantaplus; used to get the source data.
Requires source="dcop ", an interface and a method name. The arguments passed to the method. It can be empty or" %tagname% ", meaning the current tags name.
A container tag that groups together the items in a list. It may appear only once for each attribute description. This is an element-only type element.
Specifies the position of a tag's attribute text within a dialog. This tag can only occur once for each attribute in the dialog (ie; one for each & lt; attr > tag). This element is empty.
Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. This tag should occur once for each field in the dialog (ie; one for each & lt; attr > and & lt; label > tag). This element is empty.
Defines a list of elements that can appear within the tag being specified. This element is an element-only type element.
Defines a list of elements that force a tag to end. This element is an element-only type element.
All TagXML files must begin with the & XML; declaration: & lt; ?xml version="1.0 "encoding="UTF-8"? > and must be properly nested and closed.
White space does not adversely affect anything, but watch out for & and & lt; characters. These should likely be replaced with an & amp; and & lt;, respectively, in elements such as & lt; tooltip >, & lt; whatsthis >, and & lt; text >. Not doing so will not cause a crash, but you will have chunks of your work disappear if you do not.
To validate your TagXML files, simply click the Tools pop-up dialog at the top of & quantaplus; and select Validate TagXML. A dialog will present itself and you need only to follow the simple directions.
This feature is currently not present. Currently validation occurs when the TagXML files are loaded into & quantaplus;.
The following will show you a valid Family 1 TagXML file. This file happens to describe & W3C; & XML; Schema's & lt; schema > element. The file name for this TagXML file would be schema. tag. Simple, eh?
The following will show you a valid Family 2 TagXML file. This file happens to describe & PHP; 's overload function. The file name for this TagXML file would be overload. tag.
& lt; ?xml version="1.0 "encoding="UTF-8"? > & lt; !DOCTYPE tags > & lt; tags > & lt; tag name="overload "type="function" returnType="void "> & lt; attr name="class_name" type="string "status="optional"/ > & lt; /tag > & lt; /tags >
The & descriptionrc; file is, also, quite simple and there is an editor for it accessible from DTD Edit DTD Settings. This will edit the & descriptionrc; for a & DTEP; you can select from a list. In order to edit the & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; you should create a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:
[General] Version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; =3.1.2 and 2 for any version greater. Name = DTD definition string. (-/ /W3C; // DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional/ /EN) NickName = The beautified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). If not defined, Name is used as NickName.
You can create an action by going to Settings Configure Actions. Click on New Action and you will face a similar dialog:
The shortcut assigned to this action. Click on Custom or the button near Custom to assign a shortcut; click on None to remove the currently assigned shortcut.
The simplest actions. You can enter some text in the Detailed Settings area and whenever the action is executed this text will be inserted in your document at the current cursor position. See the below example.
The most powerful action type. With the help of this action you can run external applications (usually scripts, but it's not limited to scripts), which can alter your document or use your document (or part of your document) as input. Examples from & quantaplus; itself are the Quick Start dialog, the various View In... actions for the (X)HTML DTEPs.
First you have to enter the name of your script with the interpreter as well. Example: sh / home/ myHome/ myScript. sh.
Although you can use full paths, the recommended way is to use the %scriptdir variable in the command line, like sh %scriptdir/ myScript. sh. This way & quantaplus; will try to locate your script in the following places: global script folder: $KDEDIR / share/ apps/ quanta/ scripts local script folder: $KDEHOME / share/ apps/ quanta/ scripts your path: $PATH There are other special variables that you can use in the command line:
%f: will be replaced with the URL of the current document. In case of local documents, file: / will be stripped from the document.
%pid: will be replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; process. If & quantaplus; is running in unique mode, the "unique" text will be prepended to the PID number. Useful when you use DCOP to control & quantaplus; from the external script.
the parameters for the event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.
Aside of the above methods the script can receive input from & quantaplus; on the standard input. In the Input combobox you can select what to send to the standard input. Choices are:
Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. Using the %input variable usually makes sense only when using this setting.
Similar to the Input you can catch the output of the executed application. There are two kind of outputs: normal output, printed to the standard output; error messages, printed to the standard error. You can specify what should happen with the text printed to the standard output. This can be done by modifying the value of the Output combobox:
If there are many tags for the markup language, it is recommended that you split up the tags into logical groups. You will need to create a new user toolbar for each group. In this case, there are not many, so we will be making one toolbar and naming it with the name of the markup.
Once all your toolbars are created, you must add and configure the actions. To do this, select Settings Configure Actions.
The parts of this window are pretty straight forward. Press the New action button at the bottom of the window to enter the editing mode.
Fill in all of the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar(s).
Complete the rest and, if the tag has attributes and you always plan to use them, check the Run "Edit tag" dialog if available box so that you will be prompted every time the action is used.
Egad! That's an awful icon. How will yourself and others remember that icon goes with that action? Let's replace it before trouble arises.
To create an icon that more accurately describes that action, we will be using & kiconedit;. Select it from the & kmenu;, Graphics More Programs (or where ever your distribution placed it).
& kiconedit; defaults to the size 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. To change this, select Edit Resize.
Keep in mind that you are creating an icon that will assist in helping not only yourself to remember which action does what, but also other users of the & DTEP;.
Since the tag I am creating the icon for is called start, I have decided to create a Start sign. Using the color green (green often interpreted as go, start, or proceed) will, or, at least, should, convey a message to the user that clicking this action will place the & lt; startgt; tag in the current document.
Once you are done with creating the icon(s), you must associate the icon with the action. To do this, open Settings Configure Actions again (in & quantaplus;) and select the action you made the icon for. Beside the Text field, you will see a button, click it.
Goto the folder in which you saved the icon, select the icon, and click OK.
Press the Apply button and either continue to do the same with the other tags, if any, or click OK to finish.
Let us say you would like to add some common & quantaplus; functions to your toolbar or maybe you think the toolbar would be better off organized in a different manner with some separators to group the actions. Open the Configure Toolbars dialog by going Settings Configure Toolbars. Make sure your toolbar is selected.
I will be choosing the separator (top of the left column) for my toolbar. Once you have selected the item you wish to add to your toolbar, press the right arrow button. This will add it to your toolbar.
I think I would like a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.
Note how the separator helps in grouping. Someone new to my toolbar might have thought that the & konqueror; button was like or the opposite of the start button.
Remember to test your toolbar, by clicking all the buttons, so that you know the output is correct.
Save it to the correct folder. Since NeXML does not exist, I will just have it to the top-level folder, but your toolbar(s) should be saved to the correct folder. Make sure to adjust your & descriptionrc; to have it load your toolbar(s) when a new file of that type is created.
Probably the most notable additions to & quantaplus; for the general user will be the addition of documentation for the markup or scripting language that you like best. To that end, this chapter will explain how I create the & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.
Before starting on creating your own documentation, you may wish to check out the & quantaplus; repository to see if someone else has already done this set.
There are two parts to this process. First, you must obtain the existing documentation for the markup/ scripting/ etc; language that you prefer. Second, you have to create the docrc file. The first is up to you, the second is what we will cover here.
#KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir= path, relative to this file, of the documentation html files & eg; php42/ #top level elements Top Element= Your description for these documentation & eg; & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1=Section1. html Section 2=#Sec2.1, #Sec2.2, #Sec2.3 Sec2.1=Sec2.1. html Sec2.2=Sec2.2. html Sec2.3=Sec2.3. html... [Context] ContextList=func1, func2, tag1, tag2, tag3 func1=func1. html func2=func2. html tag1=tag1. html tag2=tag2. html tag3=tag3. html
The Tree section defines the presentation aspect of the documentation in the documentation tab. For example, you will see that in the & PHP; documentation you have something akin to this:
#KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir=php42/ #top level elements Top Element=PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation=Table of Contents, #Getting Started, #Language Reference Table of Contents=index. html Getting Started=Introduction,... Introduction=introduction. html... Language Reference=Basic syntax,... Basic syntax=language. basic-syntax. html...
Notice the # in front of Getting Started and Language Reference. This indicates that these are sub containers in the tree and have content of their own. I do not believe that there is a set limit to the depth here (other than that driven by sanity) & mdash; use your judgment.
For the Table of Contents, you will notice that it is referenced directly to a file (and consequently shows up at the bottom of the tree view & mdash; folders first!).
Spaces do not adversely affect anything, but watch out for & and & lt; characters. These should likely be replaced by & amp; and & lt; respectively in all of the & XML; based & quantaplus; resource files.
The Context section is the section of the docrc file that is used to facilitate context sensitive help. For example, you are writing a & PHP; script and you would like to see the documentation for the mysql_fetch_array function. You simply highlight the function and then press Ctrl; H for context help. The documentation on mysql_fetch_array will immediately display. There are only two entry types here: the ContextList and the file association lines.
Really simple, this is just a comma separated list of the context items you wish to have available (for & PHP;, these are the functions for & PHP;).
Now you can just save your docrc file, save it in $HOME /. kde/ share/ apps/ quanta/ doc or $KDEDIR / share/ apps/ quanta/ doc for local or global use respectively. Then create a folder (the one specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as your docrc file and copy your & HTML; pages in there.
Once you are sure that they are good and worth sharing, send the docrc file along with a description of any pertinent information on what documentation you used to the quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. You will not get rich, but you will feel great knowing that you contributed to the best web development platform around.
With & quantaplus; you are not alone. It is possible to share the various resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. There are two ways to do it:
The resources can be sent in email to your friends, partners or to whomever you want. You will see the Send in Email menu entries in various places, like DTD Send DTD Package (DTEP) in Email, Toolbars Send Toolbar in Email, in the context menu of the files and folders in the Templates and Scripts tree.
The resources can be uploaded to our main repository, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. The submissions are reviewed and made available only if our team considers correct and useful will be published. In order to make a valid submission it is suggested to sign the resources, thus you need a GPG/ PGP key. This information is used to verify the origin of the resources both by our team and by the downloaders.
When uploading you will be asked to enter the passphrase for your secret GPG key (the passphrase will not be stored), or in the case of having more secret keys, you will be able to pick up the one you want to use. In the Share Hot New Stuff dialog fill the input fields (the Preview URL may remain empty) and start the upload by clicking OK.
The upload can be initiated from DTD Upload DTD Package (DTEP), Toolbars Upload Toolbar, in the context menu of the files and folders in the Templates and Scripts tree.
After a resource was downloaded, but before it is installed, & quantaplus; verifies if the resource is valid, by checking the integrity and the signature. In case of problems it warns you and you can decide if you want to continue or not. Please read the warning dialogs carefully. In the case when the integrity is correct and the resource is correctly signed, you will still get an information dialog, so you can see who created the resource.
It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; by creating a DTEP package. But the creation can be time consuming, as you may need to write hundreds of tag files in tagXML format. Of course, there is a nicer way to go, by converting the DTD automatically into a DTEP package.
The conversion can be started from the DTD Load & Convert DTD menu. Select the. dtd file which defines the DTD you want to use, and after that you will see the following dialog:
Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; will go under this name to the $KDEHOME / share/ apps/ quanta/ dtep folder.
! DOCTYPE definition line: the string that should appear in the! DOCTYPE tag, like HTML PUBLIC "-/ /W3C/ /DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional/ /EN" "http: / /www. w3. org/ TR/ html4/ loose. dtd"
Fine-tune the DTEP after conversion: if checked, after the conversion is done, & quantaplus; will bring up the & descriptionrc; editor, so you can fine tune the newly created & DTEP;. It is recommended to leave this options checked.
Within & quantaplus; there are several key concepts. To understand and take advantage of & quantaplus;, you must first learn these concepts, the fundamentals. This chapter will explain and show you these concepts, without which & quantaplus; would be primitive.
& quantaplus; divides the workspace into three scopes: Global, Local, and Project. These distinctions affect various components in & quantaplus;.
Global items are available to anyone that uses & quantaplus;. From toolbars to actions, everything marked as global is stored in the common & quantaplus; folder structure. This has the effect of allowing a group of admins to save certain toolbars, actions, and templates in the global tree, which can then be used to keep a multi-user installation of & quantaplus; common to everyone on the system.
Local items make up a single user's personal collection of web development resources. These items are made up of a user's templates and toolbars. Local items are stored in a user's home folder. This makes all of the user's Local items available for personal use at instance.
Project items are are only available to a particular project. These can be anything from a & CSS; template to a toolbar with custom actions which perform a special task on a project's files. Simply put, this is the most limited scope. All of the items saved in the project workspace will be saved in the project's folder tree, allowing you to share your specialized tools and templates with whomever else you share your project with.
& quantaplus; '& MDI; is broken down into various parts: the editor window, the quick info trees, informational tabs and the toolbars. Please see,,, and for more information on these parts.
You can right click on the tabs with the mouse to get a context menu with entries related to the current document, like closing the current, other or all tabs; switching to other tabs; reloading, deleting or uploading the document; switching to a bookmarked line; performing CVS operations on the current document.
Right clicking in the editor area will give you another context menu related to the edited document content, like basic editing actions (cut/ copy/ paste), editing the tag under the cursor, selecting the area covered by the tag under the cursor, getting context help about the word under the cursor or open a file if the string under the cursor points to a file.
At the top of the editor window is the editor toolbar set. Currently, & quantaplus; defaults to & HTML; 4.01 Transitional, which has a default set of toolbars that are loaded. As & quantaplus; progresses, the toolbars will be updated to meet the needs of users and to make use of newer features.
Toolbar usage is pretty straight forward. If you want to insert a basic tag, like & lt; pgt;, into your document, then you can click on the icon that represents the tag. Now you can insert your data for the tag you have just inserted. If you wish to insert a tag that requires certain attributes (like an anchor), then you will get a dialog box with the various fields for you to fill in.
The Toolviews or Quick Info Trees (QIT;) allow you to navigate, open, and gather information in & quantaplus;. Its tabbed format presents you with the Files, Project, Templates, Document Structure, Scripts, Attribute, and Documentation Trees.
Project management is one of the many powerful tools that & quantaplus; offers. This tab displays all files within your project and allows you to manage the files within the project through the use of & RMB; clicking. Actions, such as add, remove, upload, or delete files entirely from the disk, can be performed through this menu.
Another feature of & quantaplus; is templates. Templates can be anything you would like. Images, code snippets, an entire web page, et cetera. It is entirely up to you.
Templates are sorted into three categories, which are based on their scope and the context they are being used. These scopes are carried over from & quantaplus; 'workspace. Global templates are usable all times, local templates are usable to the current user, and project templates are usable only within their specified project. More on templates can be found in.
Here you will find information about the various scripts available for use by you. The Global, Local, and Project concept allows here as well. By & LMB; clicking the entries, you gain access to all the available information about the script. And & RMB; clicking allows you to perform a few actions, such as running the script, editing the script, and mailing the script, for example.
This tab displays the parser's internal representation of your document. By & LMB; clicking on an element, your cursor will taken to the element's position in the document. By & RMB; clicking on an element, you are presented with a number of actions that deal with navigating and updating the tree.
This tree appears below all the other & QIT; s. Within it you can quickly edit attributes and namespaces. The content-focused entry system allows you to modify all the available attributes with little more than a few clicks of the mouse.
Here you can find complete documentation on web technologies to aid your development. You can download pre-packaged documentation for & quantaplus; at quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and, by adding a folder named "doc" to a project, you can add, edit, and view project-specific documentation.
By default & quantaplus; has two tabs located at the bottom of the window from which useful information can be obtained. These are the Messages window and the Problems window.
This tab displays information from any scripts run in quanta. For example, the DTD being used for the current document and any changes to the DTD are displayed.
This tab shows any errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts which are executed will also print error messages (if present) in this tab.
& quantaplus; 'toolbars have been extended greatly and are easy to understand. You click on the button and you get an associated action from that button. The beautiful part about toolbars is that you can define your own actions graphically within & quantaplus;.
Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to email your toolbars. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a gzipped tar archive through & kmail;. If you receive a toolbar in email, then you can save (and load) it into & quantaplus; like any other toolbar!
It is reasonable that you would want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. To this end, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script to control this setup. To get a complete listing of these options, type. / configure --help. These are straight forward and will not be covered here.
If you are having trouble with & quantaplus; running properly, you should check your path to ensure that the & kde; 3 bin folder is in there. Also, be sure that you do not have any older versions of & kde; laying about that appear in PATH before your & kde; 3 bin folder. The same holds true for & Qt;.
& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the K Desktop Environment. & quantaplus; is designed for quick web development and is rapidly becoming a mature editor with a number of great features.
While striving to become the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus; began to think about a rather intriguing idea: What if & quantaplus; was a generic, extensible, markup language editor? Well, that would only make it the greatest Web Development Environment for & kde;! So it was done.
No longer bound to & HTML;, & quantaplus; is now well on its way to becoming an all-purpose Web Development Environment. Essentially, if you can define it in & XML;, then & quantaplus; should be able to serve as an & IDE; for it.
Now, with the above said, it must be noted that & quantaplus; is an outgrowth of the outstanding efforts that have been put forth by the entire & kde; development community. & quantaplus;, in celebration of open source, uses the idea of Why write something somebody already wrote? Thanks to & kde; 's framework, not only is this possible, but it also allows users and developers to extend & quantaplus; to match their unique needs.
& quantaplus; provides web developers with an intuitive and powerful multiple document interface (MDI;). It can dramatically increase your productivity. Through the use of custom actions, scripting, and toolbars, you can automate almost any task. With the use of Kommander, you can extend & quantaplus; in a manner in which you never have to remember scripting command syntax again. (More about this can be found in.)
& quanta; Plus is a web development environment for HTML and associate languages. It is designed for quick web development and is rapidly becoming a mature editor with a number of great features. & quanta; already has a good deal of PHP support in it including the ability to run a debugger.
& quanta; Plus is not in any way affiliated with any commercial versions of & quanta;. The primary coders from the original team left the GPL'd version to produce a commercial product.
More detailed user documentation is available from help: / quanta (either enter this URL into & konqueror;, or run khelpcenter help: / quanta).
& quanta; is currently written and maintained by Eric Laffoon sequitur@kde. org and Andras Mantia amantia@kde. org.
Quick list of the last several files you've opened. This list will change each time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest being bumped off first.
This allows you to save code snippets and entire files as a template for later use. See the section on templates. If you try to save the selected text/ file outside of the local/ project template dir, then you will receive an error.
Converts the clipboard text & HTML; special characters to & HTML; entities before pasting into the text body, so they show up properly when viewed and are n't picked up as tags by the client browser.
Converts the clipboard text into & URL; encoding, which is the correct way to include special characters and spaces into & URL; s. Used primarily when pasting a & URL; into an anchor tag.
Turn on/ off block highlighting. Allows you to select text blocks with your keyboard without holding down the & Shift; key.
Go directly to a specific line number. This is really helpful when your & PHP; script is breaking unexpectedly!
Find a string or expression in files in the selected folder. Sort of a & GUI; grep or sed with some predefined pattern spaces to help you out.
Toggle display of the message window. This is the window where you see the output of any scripting actions and the debugger.
Toggle display of the Problem Reporter at the bottom of the main & quantaplus; window. The Problem Reporter activates when you switch to the Structure Tree.
Toggle display of the icon border to the left of the main editor window. This bar allows for click toggling of bookmarks.
If you have bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with a Previous or Next item, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.
If you have bookmarks in other opened documents, they will appear in the menu grouped by the file name of the other documents.
Open an existing project file from disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the. webprj extension.
Presents a dialog that allows you to select files to add to your current project. These files will then be copied into the project folder for editing.
Scan the project folder for any new files you may have there. This allows you to copy graphics into your project folder or a subfolder thereof and then add them to the project.
Upload the files in your project to the hosting server. The list of available transports depends on the version of & kde; you are running and whether or not you've downloaded extra KIO slaves.
Settings affecting the way & quantaplus; manages your project. See the quantaplus; projects section for details.
Loads a project toolbar. These are kept in ProjectDir / toolbars and are only available in this menu if they have been assigned to this project.
Dialog for saving your toolbars. Allows you to pick the type of toolbar; Local or Project.
Brings up a dialog to create a new toolbar. This only creates the name. Actions must be added from the Settings Configure Actions menu item. Toolbars are saved via the Toolbars Save Toolbars menu or on close unsaved toolbars will prompt for you to save.
Remove a toolbar from usage. This does not remove it from the disk. If you've not saved the toolbar you are removing, you will be prompted to save it.
This is a hook to email your custom toolbar to someone (maybe the & quantaplus; team for inclusion in the next release!) for their use. It spawns an email window and attaches your toolbar file to it automatically.
This is allows you to upload toolbars to the main server, from where others can download it. See.
Load a & DTD; that you or someone else made and convert it to & quantaplus; 'native description format.
Load/ update the entities from a & DTD;. It is useful if you want to update the entities in a & DTEP; without regenerating the whole & DTEP;. In case the & DTEP; is a global one and you do not have write permission to the global KDE directory, the entity loading will fail.
This menu contains a list of the elements that are in the currently loaded toolbars. If you have the Standard (HTML;) toolbar loaded, the Tags menu will contain a submenu Standard which will contain the list of tags/ actions on that toolbar.
Allows you to access the current markup tag settings dialog if one exists. This entry is always present, followed by the & DTD; specific submenus.
Activates/ deactivates the smart insertion of tags. Currently it works only in (X)HTML DTDs. Smart insertion means that & quantaplus; will refuse to insert a tag using the toolbar if the tag cannot be present in the current location.
The Plugins menu lists the available plugins under the above menu items. Clicking them will activate them. Clicking an activated plugin will deactivate it.
Choose the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. The list of available highlighting schemes varies depending on your version of & kate;.
Select the end of line encoding type. Useful if you have folks using other & OS; platforms to develop on. Choose from Unix, Windows/ DOS or Macintosh.
Checks the syntax of the current document against the selected & DTD; using the external tidy application.
On-the-fly switching between different UI modes. Due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switching might take time and cause ugly artifacts. The recommended modes to use are IDEAl Mode, which is the default or Tab Page Mode, which is the same mode that was present in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier versions.
Furthermore this menu contains an entry for every opened tab. By selecting such an entry, that selected tab will become the active one.
Toggle on and off the display of the status bar at the bottom of the main & quantaplus; window.
The changes made in the dialog have effects on every application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.
Setup the behavior of the editor window. See the documentation on & kate; for details.
Dialog that allows you to add/ delete items to/ from toolbars and change the order the icons appear in.
This should produce help based on the current pointer context. At the time of this writing this feature is not implemented.
& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available, and freely licensed, but like any open source project, its developers can always use help. If you would like to support & quantaplus; development in a financial manner, you can find out how to here.
The fields are pretty straight forward. It is best to fill them in from top to bottom. Filling in a project name will autocomplete all the folder structure for the rest of the project. All of the paths and author information fields can be configured later on clicking Shift; F7 Project.
Here you fill in the name for your project. For example, we will call ours foo. When you fill in Name, File is filled out for you automatically.
This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. By default, it is the name of your project, but in lowercase letters and without spaces. It uses the extension webprj (eg; foo. webprj). This file is stored in the root of the project's Main Folder.
Here you fill in the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you are working through the Local protocol. Either a hostname (hostname. example. com) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) can go here.
Leave this field blank to use the default port for the protocol you are using. You may need to change this depending on your server's configuration.
This is where the templates for this project will be stored. It is a relative path to the project and by default, it points to templates. If you have a common set of files that you use for several projects, then it may be useful to point this field to it, instead of to the default.
This is where the toolbars for this project will be stored. It is a relative path to the project and by default, it points to toolbars. If you have a common set of toolbars that you use for several projects, it may be useful to point this there instead of the default.
This allows you to get files from the local file system. You can choose multiple files or entire folders.
This option is great if you have static web content that you wish to download and modify. For server side scripting (eg; & PHP;, Python, & etc;.) you will have to get the files another way.
Check this if you wish to include files found in the path of the Main Folder. Leave unchecked when starting a project from scratch.
Choosing this option will display all files and folders within the Main Folder and allow you to be more specific with your choices.
This displays a list of the files in the Main Folder. You can choose the desired files for inclusion, by checking, or exclusion, by unchecking, in your project.
The last screen of the new project wizard has 3 settings that can make your life easier. These settings are available for change from the Project Project Properties menu tree on the Upload Profiles Tab or with the keyboard shortcut Shift; F7.
Some of the items are the same as in the project wizard and are described in. The extra items are described below.
A list of file names (wildcards can be used) that will be ignored when you do project related operations like Rescan Project Folder.
A complementary option to the above one, also files listed in the. cvsignore file will be excluded from the project.
The project view that will be loaded when the project is opened. You can read more about project views in.
Select the debugger you want to use. Currently only Gubed is support. You can find more information about Gubed at. The debugger plugin can be configured with the Options button. Read to learn more about debugging.
On the Upload Profiles page you can configure the upload profiles (see), as well as enable the showing of a treeview with the content of the server for each profile by checking the Show a treeview for each profile checkbox.
On the Team Configuration page you can add, edit and remove members of the project as well as define a mailing list. Read for details.
On the Event Configuration page you can Enable the event actions, add, modify and remove these actions. Event actions are executed when some predefined event occurs, like saving a file. See for details.
By default & quantaplus; will open the last project accessed when launched. This behavior is not currently configurable.
To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Open Project icon on the toolbar. The open project dialog will pop up and allow you to choose the project you wish. Projects have a webprj extension.
When closing & quantaplus;, your project file will be saved automatically. You will be asked to save any changes before exiting if & quantaplus; detects any changed files. This same behavior occurs if you load a new project.
The project tree view gives you uncluttered access to the files in your project. This is where you manage the files in the current project.
Folders are similar but do not contain the Open and Open With... & RMB; menu items:
This is where different profiles can be chosen. The profile contains information on where the uploaded files are to be placed. Read.
This allows you to remove the current profile. If only one profile is available the button is grayed out to prevent its removal.
The password is stored in memory and is lost as soon as the program is closed. This option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and you do not want to use the more insecure Store password on disc option.
This will abort your transfer in progress or just exit out of the dialog if you change your mind before starting the upload.
With & quantaplus; you can define multiple upload profiles and, in this way, upload your project (or parts of your project) to different servers. When you edit or create a profile you will face the following dialog:
This is the hostname of the server you are copying the files to. Either a fully qualified domain name, or an IP address is needed.
Transfer protocol to use for this upload. Depending on your version of & kde; this list will vary. At the very least you should be able to choose from & FTP;, file (ie; local) and NFS.
Port for the transfer. Usually this will not need to be changed unless your network administrator is hosting a service on a port other than its well known port.
Depending on your level of paranoia, this is a time saving feature, or a danger. Use it at your discretion. The password is kept on disk as text in an obscured form, so it's not simple to read it, but anyone with programming knowledge can easily un-obscure it.
A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. You can have multiple views in a project, meaning that by simply changing the view you can load several files and toolbars which will replace the currently opened files and toolbars.
Views can be saved, opened, deleted using the Project menu or the Project Toolbar, accessible via Settings Toolbars Project Toolbar.
This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; that you will be interacting with mostly. These not only make your more productive, but they also allow you to customize & quantaplus; to your work-flow.
As previously mentioned, toolbars in & quantaplus; are primarily managed through the Toolbars menu. Usage and creation are somewhat different. The creation of toolbars is discussed in a later section entitled Creating Toolbars.
Configuring the toolbars and the elements on it can be done either by using the context menu (right click on a toolbar), where you can create a New Action, a New Toolbar, you can perform other actions like Remove Toolbar, Rename Toolbar or Configure Toolbars, which will get you the dialog where you can specify which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.
By invoking the context menu on an action (icon) placed to a toolbar, aside of the above actions you will see the Remove Action and Edit Action entries, which speak for themselves.
The toolbars and the actions on them can be configured by using the Settings Configure Toolbars... and Settings Configure Actions.. menu entries.
Templates are basically skeleton documents, code snippets and files to link to. & quantaplus; uses templates fundamentally as a standard file system with enhanced organization and interfacing. You can copy, move or link any repository currently on your system into the templates tree. Think of & quantaplus; templates as having roughly the limitations to your imagination that your file system has.
Some of the templates that ship with & quantaplus; have conditions for their usage. Please read carefully the usage statement of conditions at the top of each template before you use it.
Binaries are anything not identified purely in text. They can be any file, except text, including images, & PDF; s, flash files, etc. Binary templates are usually included in your document via links (ie; images as an img src=/ src/ url). Some examples can be found in the Templates tree under Global Templates. Please see for more information on the Templates tree.
Documents can be any type of text document. You can create new documents based on these templates. Generally you would want to nest more specific or diverse documents in subfolders. Here you can make a basic framework for what you do and deliver it to your work in an organized fashion and realize much better efficiency. Some examples can be found in the Templates tree under Global Templates. Please see for more information on the Templates tree.
This type of template is useful when you do n't want to create a new document based on a template, but want to insert the same text area over and over in your documents. They can contain anything, starting with a comment and ending with a complete menu handling JavaScript method or perl script. Some examples can be found in the Templates tree under Global Templates. Please see for more information on the Templates tree.
As the name says these templates are useful to build a whole site from a template. They are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a directory structure, everything gathered in a compressed tar archive. As of writing there are no example site templates in & quantaplus;.
Create a document structure that you love (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook, & etc;.) and click on File Save as Template Save as Local/ Project Template.
Once this is done, you will notice that (even if it is saved as a Project template) the template does not show in the project tab view. Look into the templates view to find your template under the Project templates tab.
Select some text in your document and click on File Save as Template Save Selection to Local/ Project Template file. Alternatively you can just use drag and drop to drag the selection to the Templates treeview.
Creation of a binary template is simple: just copy the file into a template folder. You can use standard file management functions to do it, like drag and drop or copy and paste from Konqueror or the Files Tree.
In the Files Tree or the Project Files treeviews right click on a folder and select Create Site Template, pick up a name for the template and save it. By default it will try to save to the project template folder, but of course you can choose to save it as a local or global template as well.
Project templates allow you to be more tightly focused. You can create headers, footers or go dynamic with & PHP; include files and link them. Additionally there are some very cool things we took into consideration when using templates in projects.
Template structure on the template tab is based on the files found in $KDEDIR / share/ apps/ quanta/ templates and $HOME /. kde/ share/ apps/ quanta/ templates. Each of these folders is specified as one of four types of container as explained above.
To set the behavior of each folder, & RMB; click in the template view on the folder and choose Properties. The following dialog will come up:
Drop down box with the three types discussed previously; files, text, template. This box will be grayed out if you have the Inherit parent attribute box checked.
This is checked by default and is fine for all but the top level folders in your templates tree. If the top level folder has this checked, it will basically deactivate templates for that folder and all that are n't explicitly set below it. If this is not a top level folder, then the blah will say something like Text snippet. If it says nothing, then chances are that you are on a top level folder.
Enables pre and post text for templates in this folder. This could be a common header/ footer for all of your templates for a given project and then you copy content templates into that folder and have a complete page with the custom header/ footer as a starting point.
Additionally if you look at your options with the & RMB; you will see complete file management tools for creating folders or copying and pasting templates from one location to another.
& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source Editors, which are accessible from the View menu. The first replaces the Source Editor with the VPL; Editor, and the second splits the editor window into two parts: the Source Editor and the VPL; Editor.
The VPL; Editor works like so: It loads a document like a normal & HTML; or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. Then you can edit it, and switching back to Source Editor, you see that the changes you made on the VPL; Editor have been merged in the Source Editor.
When working in the VPL; Editor with a document that contains & PHP;, you will see a small green icon representing the & PHP; code. You cannot directly edit it with the VPL; Editor. To edit & PHP;, you will still need to use the Source Editor. There are no plans to change this functionality.
The second mode behaves exactly like the first, except that you instantly see the impact that your changes have made, either in the Source Editor or in the VPL; Editor, and the cursors of the source editor and of the VPL; Editor are synchronized. Pressing F9 loads this mode, but, if it is already loaded, it will move the focus from one view to the other, while keeping you at the same location of the document.
The refresh intervals between the VPL; Editor and the Source Editor are configurable. Go to Settings Configure Quanta.... Select the VPL; View tab. You can choose whether you want to refresh a view only when you click on it or automatically. If you choose automatically, then you can choose a refresh interval. The general recommendation is: A smaller number for fast computers and a bigger number for slower ones.
Now, let's say you want to edit the title of your web page. How do you do it? Simply launch Tools Document Properties. This tool allows editing of invisible tags when using the VPL; Editor. The Document Properties dialog is also launched when you create a new document while in the VPL; Editor. This is in order to lessen the amount of hand coding you need to perform. With it, you can edit:
Meta tags allow you to store information about the document itself & eg; keywords for the Internet search engines. You can add or remove Meta items by pressing the two buttons below, and edit them by clicking on the list & eg; put keywords on the name column and keyword1 keyword2 on the content column.
CSS Rules are the new way to tell your web browser how to present the page. You can add or delete the CSS Rules by pressing the buttons below. You can also fill the fields like the Meta items. The editing of CSS Rules is not yet supported.
You can also link an external CSS stylesheet. Simply click on the Browse button and select your file.
You can use your cursor like you do in a wordprocessor, moving with the arrows. There may come a time when the cursor does not want to go where you want it to go (a pesky bug). Selection also works as usual. You can insert text by typing and remove text by pressing the & Backspace; or Delete key.
Now we come to tag insertion. You can insert images, applets, text decorations such as bold and so on by using the same toolbars you use in the source editor. Note that the insertion of tags does not remove previous identical tags & eg; if you insert an anchor tag around some text, then you must remove any other anchor tag around it.
Some toolbar items will be disabled, such as the Table Wizard or Quick List Wizard. They will work later in & VPL;, but, for this release, you should use the Tables or Lists toolbars.
& xsldbg; is a tool intended to help understand stylesheets. What makes it different to other stylesheet debuggers is the ability to search for items of interest and trace stylesheet execution.
In order to successfully use & xsldbg;, you need & kde; libxslt, libexslt and libxml installed which are available on a typical & kde; installation.
Break at a template, at a location in a stylesheet or xml file loaded by xsldbg, or at the current node. New for xsldbg 3.1.4: When in gdb compatibility mode orphaned breakpoints can be set at a specific file and line number and be resolved to an active later on.
xsldbg will try to guess the complete URL given a file name without a path specified. a file name in the same directory as the top stylesheet loaded a file name relative to the current working directory of xsldbg Ie if you have loaded a stylesheet file of.. / en/ xsldoc. xsl you can do this
This command will match a partial or complete QNAME template and or mode name provided. & eg; template will match any QNAME with a local part of template
Any name spaces in the provided QNAME will be expanded as specified by the names spaces defined in the XSL SOURCE file. & eg; xsl: test1 will be expanded to http: / /www. w3. org/ 199/ XSL/ Transform: test1
A requested breakpoint may need to be resolved to its associated URL and line number. This is done automatically after the first template has been seen by xsldbg. Breakpoints are re-validated shortly after the start of each run.
break -l & lt; FILENAMEgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (To set breakpoint at specified file, line number)
break \\*nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (To break at the * template. Other name that include * will not be treated specially.)
data & lt; DATAgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (To change to a new xml data file. A leading ~ is replaced by the $HOME environment variable value. You will need to use the run command to process it)
disable -l & lt; FILENAMEgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Disable breakpoint at specified file, line number)
disable -l & lt; URIgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Disable breakpoint at specified URI, line number)
enable -l & lt; FILENAMEgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Enable/ disable breakpoint at specified file, line number)
enable -l & lt; URIgt; & lt; LINENOgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Enable/ disable breakpoint at specified URI, line number)
frame & lt; FRAME_DEPTHgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Depth is a number from 0 to the current depth of call stack)
Print a list of global stylesheet variables or parameters. Print the value of a global variable
Print a list of local stylesheet variables or parameters. Print the value of a local variable
Skip over an xsl: call-template or xsl: apply-templates. This command has the same effect of entering the commands "step" and then "up"
output & lt; FILENAMEgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (A local writable file name. Which can have a "~" prefix on *nix and CYGWIN platforms. Or environment variables under RISC OS)
output & lt; URIgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (The & lt; URIgt; must only use the "file: / /" protocol. This is then converted to a file name suitable for the operating system)
All output files are stored in, value of the "searchresultspath" option if set, or the same directory as the provided stylesheet. searchresults. xml is normally transformed by search. xsl, but will be transformed using searchhtml. xsl if the "prefrehtml" option is set.
When the search command is issued a xml file (searchresults. xml) will be created. You can then process this file with your own stylesheet to present data in other ways. If "preferhtml" option is not set then searchresult. txt is printed to display.
Depending on the amount of data collected it might take a while to complete this command.
search & lt; XPATHgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (See what xpath can be used see search. dtd. The default & lt; XPATHgt; is '/ /search/ * ')
catalogsnbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (If & lt; INTEGER_VALUEgt; is true use the catalogs from $SGML_CATALOG_FILES or SGML$CatalogFiles for risc operating system)
docbooknbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (If & lt; INTEGER_VALUEgt; is true and docbook is still supported by libxml the input document is SGML docbook)
preferhtmlnbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (If & lt; INTEGER_VALUEgt; is true prefer html output for search results. See search command)
utf8inputnbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (If & lt; INTEGER_VALUEgt; is true all input from user is in UTF-8. This is normally used when xsldbg is running as a thread)
At most GDB_LINES_TO_PRINT lines will be printed when evaluating expressions, followed by a "...". See options. h to change this value, the default is three lines of text
When printing expressions with cat/ print. The evaluated value will be prefixed by "=" & lt; EXPRESSION & gt;
repeatnbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (If & lt; INTEGER_VALUEgt; is greater than zero(0) then run the transformation & lt; INTEGER_VALUEgt; times)
Where value is by default false if the option name is preceded by "no", & eg; setoption nonet
catalognamesnbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (The names of the catalogs to use when the catalogs option is set. Value will be lost if set before setting catalogs option)
searchresultspathnbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; What path is to be used when storing the results of searching. If this is not set then xsldbg will use the path of the stylesheet
If a mode exists on a template breakpoint then it will be appended to the end of template name for breakpoint. An example of the output is:
source & lt; SOURCEgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (To change to a new source file. A leading ~ is replaced by the $HOME environment variable value. You will need to use the run command to execute it)
templates & lt; TEMPLATEgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Print details of template named & lt; TEMPLATEgt; if it can be found)
tty & lt; TTY_LEVELgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Set the level of tty redirection, where & lt; TTY_LEVELgt; is a valid level of input/ output to use)
1 = Terminal output of results of transformation, tracing and walking & nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Default state when tty device has been opened. Not fully implemented yet.)
walk & lt; SPEEDgt; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; (Use Ctrl-c to stop execution, & lt; SPEEDgt; is a value between 0 and 9. Where 0 means stop, 1 is very fast, 9 is very slow)
& xsldbg; is a text based tool to debug stylesheets (the eXtensible Stylesheet Language) and has commands similar to the Unix/ Linux debugger gdb. It has three major modes of execution of stylesheets.
xsldbg --shell --cd & lt; PATHgt; --param & lt; NAMEgt;: lt; VALUEgt; --lang & lt; LANGgt; --output & lt; FILEgt; --version --verbose --timing --repeat --debug --valid --out --maxdepth val --html --docbook --net --catalogs --xinclude --profile --gdb --autoencode --utf8input --preferhtml --stdout --autorestart +XSLSource +XMLData
Start a shell, once a shell is started use & xsldbg; 's help command to get run time help.
Add a parameter named & lt; NAMEgt; and value & lt; VALUEgt; to XSL environment. See also'addparam 'command documentation
Run the transformation 20 times, if --repeat is listed twice then run transformation 100 time
The input document is(are) an HTML file(s) treat the as such if libxml has such support enabled
Enable XInclude processing on document input if libxml has such support enabled, by default this is on
On systems with readline library available you can use the back/ forward keys to navigate the history of entered commands. On all systems the last entered command can be repeated by just pressing the & lt; ENTERgt; key.
Several commands take more that one argument. Quotes may be used to lead to complex expressions being treated as one argument. eg break & quot; * _BAR_ @quot; would allow you to see a breakpoint on the template with the name & quot; * _BAR_ @quot;
TEMPLATE_NAME: A valid template name contains only ASCII character codes 0x00 to 0x7F. And can be a fully qualified name ie "xsl: templateName".
FILENAME: A valid file name local to the system of the user. It can have a "~" prefix on *nix and CYGWIN platforms. Or environment variables under RISC OS
PATH: A path to change working directory to. On some operating systems a "~" prefix will be replaced by your home directory path
DATA: The xml data(document) being/ to be processed by the stylesheet. See & lt; FILENAMEgt; and & lt; URIgt;
Running related: {bye _BAR_ exit _BAR_ quit}, step, stepup, stepdown, next, continue, run, trace, setoption, options
Several graphical diff tools exist. Why choose & kdiff3;? Let me say, why I wrote it.
The merge then was difficult because one contributor had changed many things and corrected the indentation in many places. Another contributor also had changed much text in the same file, which resulted in several merge conflicts.
The tool I used then, only showed the changed lines, but not what had changed within these lines. And there was no information about where only the indentation was changed. The merge was a little nightmare.
So this was the start. The first version could show differences within a line and showed white space differences. Later many other features were added to increase the usefulness.
For example if you want to compare some text quickly, then you can copy it to the clipboard and paste it into either diff window.
A feature that required a big effort was the directory comparison and merge facility, which turned the program almost into a full file browser.
3-way-merging is fully supported. This is useful if two people change code independently. The original file (the base) is used to help & kdiff3; to automatically select the correct changes. The merge-editor below the diff-windows allows you to solve conflicts, while showing you the output you will get. You can even edit the output. This screenshot shows three input files being merged:
& kdiff3; also helps you to compare and merge complete directories. This screenshot shows & kdiff3; during a directory merge:
By using the possibilities of a graphical color display & kdiff3; shows exactly what the difference is. When you have to do many code-reviews, you will like this.
Spaces and tabs that differ appear visibly. When lines differ only in the amount of white space this can be seen at one look in the summary column on the left side. (No more worries when people change the indentation.)
If one file is the same and one file is different on a line then the color shows which file is different. The red color means that both other files are different.
If all files have the same name but are in different directories, you can reduce typework by specifying the filename only for the first file. E. g.:
kdiff3 dir1 dir2 kdiff3 dir1 dir2 -o destdir kdiff3 dir1 dir2 dir3 kdiff3 dir1 dir2 dir3 -o destdir
The open dialog allows to edit the filenames by hand, selecting a file via the file-browser ("File...") or allows to choose recent files from the drop-down lists. If you open the dialog again, then the current names still remain there. The third input file is not required. If the entry for "C" remains empty, then only a two file diff analysis will be done.
You can also select a directory via "Dir...". If for A a directory is specified then a directory-comparison/ merge starts. If A specifies a file but B, C or the output specify a directory, then & kdiff3; uses the filename from A in the specified directories.
If "Merge" is selected, then the "Output"-line becomes editable. But it is not required to specify the output filename immediately. You can also postpone this until saving.
The "Configure..." -button opens the options-dialog, so that you can set the options before running the analysis.
Sometimes you want to compare parts of a text that is not an own file. & kdiff3; also allows you to paste text from the clipboard into the diff input window that has the focus. The diff analysis happens immediately then. In the open dialog you need not specify files then, but just close it via "Cancel".
You can also use drag and drop: Drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it onto a diff input window.
What's the idea? Sometimes a file contains two similar functions, but checking how similar they really are is a big effort if you first must create two files and then load them. Now you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.
Note: Currently you cannot drag anything from & kdiff3;. Only dropping in the diff input is supported.
Warning: Some editors still interpret the drag and drop into another program like cut (instead of copy) and paste. Your original data might be lost then.
At the top of each text window is its "info line". The info lines of the input windows contain a letter "A", "B" or "C", the editable filename, a button for browsing, and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (Note that window "C" is optional.) Each info line appears in a different color.
The three input windows are assigned the letters "A", "B" and "C". "A" has color blue, "B" has green and "C" has magenta. (These are the defaults, but can be changed in the Settings-Menu.)
When a difference is detected then the color shows which input file differs. When both other input files differ then the color used to express this is red by default ("Conflict color" in the Settings). This colorscheme is especially useful in the case of three input files, which will be seen in the next section (Merging).
Left of each text is the "summary column". If differences occurred on a line then the summary column shows the respective color. For a white-space-only difference the summary is chequered. For programming languages where white space is not so important this is useful to see at one glance if anything of importance was modified. (In C/ C++ white space is only interesting within strings, comments, for the preprocessor, and some only very esoteric situations.)
The vertical line separating the summary column and the text is interrupted if the input file had no lines there. When word-wrap is enabled then this vertical line appears dotted for wrapped lines.
The merge output editor window (below the diff input windows) also has an info line at the top showing "Output:", the filename and "[Modified]" if you edited something. Usually it will contain some text through the automatic merge facilities, but often it will also contain conflicts.
!!! Saving is disabled until all conflicts are resolved!!! (Use the "Go to prev/ next unsolved conflicts"-buttons to find the remaining conflicts.)
With only two input files every difference is also a conflict that must be solved manually.
When clicking into the summary column with the left mouse button in either window then the beginning of the group belonging to that line will shown in all windows. This group then becomes the "current group". It is highlighted with the "Current range (diff) background color" and a black bar appears on the left side of the text.
Sometimes, when a line is removed either by automatic merge or by editing and no other lines remain in that group, then the text & lt; No src linegt; will appear in that line. This is just a placeholder for the group for when you might change your mind and select some source again. This text wo n't appear in the saved file or in any selections you want to copy and paste.
The text "lt; Merge Conflictgt;" will appear in the clipboard if you copy and paste some text containing such a line. But still be careful to do so.
Note: When choosing either source for unsolved white space conflicts and the options "Ignore Numbers" or "Ignore C/ C++ Comments" are used then changes in numbers or comments will be treated like white space too.
Much navigation will be done with the scroll bars and the mouse but you can also navigate with the keys. If you click into either window then you can use the cursor buttons left, right, up, down, page up, page down, home, end, ctrl-home, ctrl-end as you would in other programs. The overview-column next to the vertical scroll bar of the input files can also be used for navigating by clicking into it.
In the merge output editor you can also use the other keys for editing. You can toggle between insert and overwrite mode with the insert key. (Default is insert-mode.)
A left-mouse-button-click into any summary column will synchronise all windows to show the beginning of the same group of lines (as explained in section "Setting The Current Group And Synchronising Merge And Diff View Position").
The button bar also contains nine navigation buttons with which you can jump to the current/ first/ last difference, to the next/ previous difference (ctrl-down/ ctrl-up), to the next/ previous conflict (ctrl-pgdown/ ctrl-pgup), or to the next/ previous unsolved conflict. Note that for & kdiff3; a "conflict" that was not automatically solved at the start of the merge stays a "conflict" even if it is solved. Hence the necessity to distinguish "unsolved conflicts".
To copy to the clipboard you must press the "Copy"-button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). But there exists an option" Auto Copy Selection ". If this is enabled, then whatever you select is copied immediately and you do n't need to explicitly copy. But pay attention when using this because the contents of the clipboard might then be destroyed accidentally.
Line endings are saved according to the normal method on the underlying operating system. For Unices each line ends with an linefeed-character "\", while for Win32-based systems each line ends with a carriage-return + a linefeed "\\r\". & kdiff3; does not preserve the line-endings of the input files, which also means that you should n't use & kdiff3; with binary files.
Options and the recent-file-list will be saved when you exit the program, and reloaded when you start it. (Menu Settings- > Configure & kdiff3;...)
Select a fixed width font. (On some systems this dialog will also present variable width fonts, but you should not use them.)
If you select this, then text differences will be drawn with the italic version of the selected font. If the font does n't support italic, then this does nothing.
On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors are not available in pure form. On such systems the "Defaults"-button will choose a pure color.
If this is disabled and you press the tabulator key, a tab-character is inserted, otherwise the appropriate amount of characters is inserted.
When pressing Enter or Return the indentation of the previous line is used for the new line.
Every selection is immediately copied to the clipboard when active and you need n't explicitly copy it.
When saving you can select what line end style you prefer. The default setting is the common choice for the used operating system.
When comparing files, & kdiff3; first it tries to match lines that are equal in all input files. Only during this step it might ignore white space. The second step compares each line. In this step white space will not be ignored. Also during the merge white space will not be ignored.
Some editors (on some systems) save carriage return '\\r 'and linefeed '\ '-characters at the end of line, while others will only save the linefeed '\'. Usually & kdiff3; ignores the carriage return, but then files that do n't have equal sizes, look equal in side by side comparison. When this option is on, then the carriage return characters are made visible but are treated as white space. This option must be off during a merge. Default is off.
Default is off. Number characters ('0'-'9 ','. ', '-') will be ignored in the first part of the analysis in which the line matching is done. In the result the differences will be shown nevertheless, but they are treated as white space.
Default is off. Case-differences of characters (like'A 'vs. 'a') will be treated like changes in white space.
Try hard to find an even smaller delta. (Default is on.) This will probably be effective for complicated and big files. And slow for very big files.
When in auto-advance-mode this setting specifies how long to show the result of the selection before jumping to the next unsolved conflict.
Automatically solve all white-space conflict by choosing the specified file. (Default is manual choice.) Useful if white space really is n't important in many files. If you need this only occasionally better use "Choose A/ B/ C For All Unsolved Whitespace Conflicts" in the merge menu. Note that if you enable either "Ignore numbers" or "Ignore C/ C++ comments" then this auto-choice also applies for conflicts in numbers or comments.
These options are concerned with scanning the directory and handling the merge: See the Directory Comparison/ Merge Docs for details.
When a file is saved and an older version already exists, then the original version will be renamed with an ". orig" extension. If an old backup file with ". orig" extension already exists then this will be deleted without backup.
Adjust the language of the user interface. Changing this option does n't affect the running program. You have to exit and restart & kdiff3; so that the language is changed. (This option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; because the language is adjustable in the global KDE settings.)
The following encoding options can be adjusted separately for each item or if this option is true, all values will take the first value.
Above the codec-selectors appears a note that tells you what the local encoding is. (This is not adjustable but for your information just in case you do n't know your local encoding, but need to select it.)
Adjust the file encoding for input files. This has an effect on how the special characters are interpreted. Since you can adjust each codec separately you can even compare and merge files that were saved using different codecs.
When you have edited a file, then you can adjust which encoding will be used when saving to disk.
When you define preprocessors then they might not be able to operate on your codec. (e. g.: Your files are 16-bit-unicode and your preprocessor can only take 8-bit-ascii.) With this option you can define the encoding of preprocessor output.
Turn this off to suppress any highlighting of white-space-only changes in the text or overview-columns. (Note that this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options "Ignore numbers" or "Ignore C/ C++ comments" are active.)
These choices are only available when you compare three files. In normal mode all differences are shown in one color-coded overview-column. But sometimes you are especially interested in the differences between only two of these three files. Selecting "A vs. B", "A vs. C" or "B vs. C"-overview will show a second overview column with the required information next to the normal overview.
Sometimes you want to use the space on the screen better for long lines. Hide the windows that are not important. (In the Windows-menu.)
Switch between diff windows shown next to each other (A left of B left of C) or above each other (A above B above C). This should also help for long lines. (In the Windows-menu.)
Sometimes you are viewing the deltas and decide to merge. "Merge current file" in the Directory-menu also works if you only compare two files. A single click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last input-file as the default output filename. (When this is used to restart a merge, then the output filename will be preserved.)
When any file is read, it will be piped through this external command. The output of this command will be visible instead of the original file. You can write your own preprocessor that fulfills your specific needs. Use this to cut away disturbing parts of the file, or to automatically correct the indentation etc.
When any file is read, it will be piped through this external command. If a preprocessor-command (see above) is also specified, then the output of the preprocessor is the input of the line-matching preprocessor. The output will only be used during the line matching phase of the analysis. You can write your own preprocessor that fulfills your specific needs. Each input line must have a corresponding output line.
The idea is to allow the user greater flexibility while configuring the diff-result. But this requires an external program, and many users do n't want to write one themselves. The good news is that very often sed or perl will do the job.
Use the following Line-Matching-Preprocessor-Command to convert all input to uppercase: sed's/ \\(. *\\)/ \\U\\1/ 'Here the ". *" is a regular expression that matches any string and in this context matches all characters in the line. The "\\1" in the replacement string refers to the matched text within the first pair of "\\(" and "\\)". The "\\U" converts the inserted text to uppercase.
CVS and other version control systems use several keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs/ Keyword substitution). All of them follow the pattern "$KEYWORD generated text$". We now need a Line-Matching-Preprocessor-Command that removes only the generated text: sed's/ \\$\\(Revision\\_BAR_Author\\_BAR_Log\\_BAR_Header\\_BAR_Date\\). *\\$/ \\$\\1\\$/ 'The "\\_BAR_" separates the possible keywords. You might want to modify this list according to your needs. The "\\" before the "$" is necessary because otherwise the "$" matches the end of the line.
While experimenting with sed you might come to understand and even like these regular expressions. They are useful because there are many other programs that also support similar things.
Ignoring numbers actually is a built-in option. But as another example, this is how it would look as a Line-Matching-Preprocessor-command. sed's/ [0123456789. -]/ /g 'Any character within '[' and ']' is a match and will be replaced with nothing.
Sometimes you want to apply several substitutions at once. You can then use the semicolon ';' to separate these from each other. Example:
Instead of sed you might want to use something else like perl. perl -p -e's/ REGEXP / REPLACEMENT / FLAGS 'But some details are different in perl. Note that where sed needed "\\(" and "\\)" perl requires the simpler "(" and ")" without preceding '\\'. Example:
The data after the normal preprocessor will be preserved for display and merging. The other operations only modify the data that the line-matching-diff-algorithm sees.
In the rare cases where you use a normal preprocessor note that the line-matching-preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.
The preprocessor-commands are often very useful, but as with any option that modifies your texts or hides away certain differences automatically, you might accidentally overlook certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.
Often programmers must modify many files in a directory to achieve their purpose. For this & kdiff3; also lets you compare and merge complete directories recursively!
... for each item proposes a merge operation, which you can change before starting the directory merge,
... lets you simulate the merge and lists the actions that would take place, without actually doing them,
... lets you run the selected operation for all items (key F7) or the selected item (key F6),
This is very similar to the single file merge and comparison. You just have to specify directories on the command line or in the file-open dialog.
When three directories are merged then dir1 is used as the base for the merge. If no destination directory is specified, then & kdiff3; will use dir3 as the destination directory for the merge.
Note that only the comparison starts automatically, not the merge. For this you first must select a menu entry or the key F7. (More details later.)
While reading the directories a message-box appears that informs you of the progress. If you abort the directory scan, then only files that have been compared until then will be listed.
When the directory scan is complete then & kdiff3; will show a listbox with the results left,...
Each file and directory that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. You can select an item by clicking it with the mouse once.
The directories are collapsed by default. You can expand and collapse them by clicking on the "+"/" - "or by double-clicking the item or by using the left/ right-arrow-keys. The" Directory"-menu also contains two actions "Fold all subdirs" and "Unfold all subdirs" with which you can collapse or expand all directories at once.
If you double-click a file item then the file comparison starts and the file-diff-window will appear.
The image in the name column reflects the file type in the first directory ("A"). It can be one of these:
If the file type is different in the other directories, then this is visible in the columns A/ B/ C and in the window that shows the details about the selected item. Note that for such a case no merge operation can be selected automatically. When starting the merge, then the user will be informed of problems of that kind.
As can be seen in the image above the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A/ B/ C.
But for items that were identical in the comparison their color also is identical even if the age is not.
Directories are considered equal if all items they contain are identical. Then they also will have the same color. But the age of a directory is not considered for its color.
The idea for this coloring scheme I came upon in dirdiff. The colors resemble the colors of a leaf that is green when new, turns yellow later and red when old.
... A and C are equal but B is not: Copy from B (or if B does not exist, delete the destination if exists)
... A and B are equal but C is not: Copy from C (or if C does not exist, delete the destination if exists)
... B and C are equal but A is not: Copy from C (or if C does not exist, delete the destination if exists)
... A, B and C do n't have the same file type (e. g. A is a directory, B is a file): "Error: Conflicting File Types". While such items exist the directory merge cannot start.
... A and B do n't have the same file type (e. g. A is a directory, B is a file): "Error: Conflicting File Types". While such items exist the directory merge cannot start.
Sync-mode is active if only two directories and no explicit destination were specified and if the option "Synchronize directories" is active. & kdiff3; then selects a default operation so that both directories are the same afterwards. If for an item...
... A and B exist, but are not equal: Merge and store the result in both directories. (For the user the visible save-filename is B, but then & kdiff3; copies B also to A.)
When two directories are merged and the option "Copy newer instead of merging" is selected, then & kdiff3; looks at the dates and proposes to choose the newer file. If the files are not equal but have equal dates, then the operation will contain "Error: Dates are equal but files are not." While such items exist the directory merge cannot start.
During the merge one file after the other will be processed. The status column will show "Done" for items where the merge operation has succeeded, and other texts if something unexpected happened. When a merge is complete, then you should make a last check to see if the status for all items is agreeable.
When the file comparison mode "Full Analysis" is enabled in the options, then & kdiff3; will show extra columns containing the numbers of unsolved, solved, nonwhite and whitespace conflicts. (The solved-column will only show when comparing or merging three directories.)
You can either merge the currently selected item (file or directory), or all items. When you have made all your operation choices (in all subdirectories too) then you can start the merge.
Be aware that if you did n't specify a destination directory explicitly, then the destination will be "C" in three directory mode, "B" in two directory merge mode, and in sync-mode it will be "A" or/ and "B".
If you have specified a destination directory also check that all items that should be in the output, are in the tree. There are some options that cause certain items to be omitted from the directory comparison and merge. Check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:
To merge all items: Select "Start/ Continue directory merge" in the "Directory"-menu or press F7 (which is the default shortcut). To merge only the current item: Select" Run Operation For Current Item "or press F6.
If due to conflicting filetypes still some items with invalid operations exist, then a messagebox will appear and these items will be pointed out, so you can select a valid operation for the item.
If you merge all items a dialog will appear giving you the options "Do it", "Simulate it" and "Cancel".
Select "Simulate it" if you want to see what would be done without actually doing it. A verbose list of all operations will be shown.
Then & kdiff3; will run the specified operation for all items. If manual interaction is required (single file merge), then a merge window will open (see the big screenshot).
When you have finished with manually merging a file, again select "Start/ Continue directory merge" or the key F7. If you have n't saved it yet, a dialog will ask you to do so. Then & kdiff3; will continue with the next item.
When & kdiff3; encounters an error, it will tell you so and will show the verbose-status-information. At the bottom of this list, there will be some error messages which should help you to understand the cause of the problem. When you continue merging (F7 key) & kdiff3; will give you the choice to retry or skip the item that caused the problem. This means that before continuing you can choose another operation or solve the problem by other means.
If some items were merged individually before running the directorymerge then & kdiff3; remembers this (while this merge-session goes on), and does n't merge them again when later the merge for all items is run. Even when the merge was skipped or nothing was saved these items count as completed. Only when you change the merge operation the "Done"-status of the item will be removed and it can be merged again.
The & kdiff3; -preferences (menu "Settings"-gt;" Configure & kdiff3; ") has a section called" Directory Merge "with these options:
Only files that match any pattern here will be put in the tree. More than one pattern may be specified here by using the semicolon ";" as separator. Valid wildcards: '* 'and'? '. (e. g. "*. cpp; *. h"). Default is "*". This pattern is not used on directories.
Files that match this pattern will be excluded from the tree. More than one pattern may be specified here via using the semicolon ";" as separator. Valid wildcards: '* 'and'? '. Default is "*. orig; *. o; *. obj".
Directories that match this pattern will be excluded from the tree. More than one pattern may be specified here via using the semicolon ";" as separator. Valid wildcards: '* 'and'? '. Default is "CVS; deps;. svn".
Ignore files and directories that would also be ignored by CVS. Many automatically generated files are ignored by CVS. The big advantage is that this can be directory specific via a local ". cvsignore"-file. (See info: / cvs/ cvsignore.)
On some file systems files have an "Hidden"-attribute. On other systems a filename starting with a dot". "causes it to be hidden. This option allows you to decide whether to include these files in the tree or not. Default is on.
For links to files: When disabled, then the symbolic links are compared. When enabled, then the files behind the links are compared. Default is off.
For links to directories: When disabled, then the symbolic links will be compared. When enabled then the link will be treated like a directory and it will be scanned recursively. (Note that the program does n't check if the link is "recursive". So for example a directory that contains a link to the directory would cause an infinite loop, and after some time when the stack overflows or all memory is used up, crash the program.) Default is off.
Do a full analysis of each file and show the statistics information columns. (Number of solved, unsolved, nonwhite and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when used on files that do n't contain text. (Specify the appropriate file-antipatterns.)
If you compare big directories over a slow network, it might be faster to compare the modification dates and file length alone. But this speed improvement comes with the price of a little uncertainty. Use this option with care. Default is off.
Similar to trusting the modification date. No real comparison happens. Two files are considered equal if their file-sizes are equal. This is useful when the file-copy operation did n't preserve the modification date. Use this option with care. Default is off.
Activates "Sync-Mode" when two directories are compared and no explicit destination directory was specified. In this mode the proposed operations will be chosen so that both source directories are equal afterwards. Also the merge result will be written to both directories. Default is off.
Instead of merging the proposed operation will copy the newer source if changes happened. (Considered unsafe, because it implies that you know, that the other file has n't been edited too. Check to make sure in every case.) Default is off.
If a file or complete directory is replaced by another or is deleted then the original version will be renamed with an ". orig" extension. If an old backup file with ". orig" extension already exists then this will be deleted without backup. This also affects the normal merging of single files, not only in directory-merge mode. Default is on.
Usually the directory merge list view remains visible while a single file is compared or merged. With the mouse you can move the splitter bar that separates the file list from the text-diff windows. If you do n't want this, you can disable "Split Screen View" in the "Directory"-menu. Then you can use" Toggle View "in the" Directory"-menu to switch between the file list and the text-diff view that then occupy the full screen.
Probably you will prefer a simple double mouse click on a file in order to compare it. Nevertheless there also exists an entry in the "Directory"-menu. You can also directly merge a single file by selecting it and choosing" Merge current file "in the" Merge"-Menu. On saving the result, the status will be set to done, and the file will not be merged again if a directory merge is started.
But note that this status information will be lost when you rerun a directory scan: "Directory"-menu:" Rescan "
KDE supports networktransparency via KIO-slaves. & kdiff3; uses this for reading input files and for scanning directories. This means that you can specify files and directories on local and remote resources via URLs.
The first line compares a local file with a file on an FTP-server. The second line compares a directory within an compressed archive with a local directory.
An URL has a different syntax compared with paths for local files and directories. Some things should be considered:
A path can be relative and can contain "." or "..". This is not possible for URLs which are always absolute.
Special characters must be written with "escaping". ("#"- >" %23 ", space- >" %20 ", etc.) E. g. A file with the name" / #foo# "would have the URL" file: / %23foo%23 ".
Sometimes this is due to the file system of the server, sometimes due to the protocol. Here is a short list of restrictions:
Or there is no way to distinguish if a link points to a file or a directory; always assuming a file. (ftp:, sftp:).
No possibility to modify permissions or modification time, so permissions or time of a copy will differ from the original. (See the option "Trust the size".) (To modify permissions or modification time is only possible for local files.)
It's main use is as difference-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop always starts the internal difference viewer first. To invoke & kdiff3; press the right mouse button on the difference viewer window and select "Show in KDiff3Part" from the contextmenu.
& kdiff3; normally requires two complete files as input. When used as part & kdiff3; will assume that the inputfile is a patch-file in the unified format. & kdiff3; then retrieves the original filenames from the patch-file. At least one of the two files must be available. & kdiff3; will then invoke patch to recreate the second file.
In Konqueror you can select a patch-file and select "Preview in"-"KDiff3Part" from the contextmenu. Be aware that this wo n't work if none of the original files are available, and it is not reliable if the original file(s) have changed since the patch-file was generated.
When run as a part & kdiff3; only provides the a two-file-diff, a very small toolbar and menu. Merging or directory-comparison are not supported then.
Tools named "KDiff" and "KDiff2" (now called "Kompare") already exist. Also "KDiff3" should suggest that it can merge like the "diff3"-tool in the Diff-Tool collection.
I'm using GPL programs for a very long time now and learned very much by having a look at many of the sources. Hence this is my "Thank You" to all programmers that also did so or will do the same.
You compiled from source but you probably did n't specify the correct KDE-prefix with configure. By default configure wants to install in / usr/ local but then KDE ca n't find the user-interface resource file (i. e. kdiff3ui. rc). The README-file contains more information about the correct prefix.
Lines where only the amount of white space characters is different are treated as "equal" at first, while just one different non-white character causes the lines to be "different". If similar lines appear next to each other, this actually is coincidence but this fortunately is often the case. See also Manual Diff Help.
For each equal or different section the editor in the merge result window remembers where it begins or ends. This is needed so that conflicts can be solved manually by simply selecting the source button (A, B or C). This information is lost while saving as text and it is too much effort to create a special file format that supports saving and restoring all necessary information.
This was too much effort until now. You can always restore a version from one source (A, B or C) by clicking the respective button. For big editing the use of another editor is recommended anyway.
When I removed some text, then suddenly "lt; No src linegt;" appeared and cannot be deleted. What does that mean and how can one remove this?
& kdiff3; already uses many colors for difference highlighting. More highlighting would be confusing. Use another editor for this.
Several cool ideas and bugreports came from colleagues and many people out in the Wild Wild Web. Thank you!
In order to successfully use all features of & kdiff3;, you need & kde; > 3.1.
For information about how to run & kdiff3; on other platforms without KDE please see the homepage.
You can find a list of changes at http: / /kdiff3. sourceforge. net/ ChangeLog or in the "ChangeLog"-file of the source package.
In order to compile and install & kdiff3; on a system with KDE, type the following in the base directory of the & kdiff3; distribution:
kde-dir specifies the directory containing KDE on your system. If you are not sure, read the README-file for details.
Since & kdiff3; uses autoconf and automake you should have no trouble compiling it. Should you run into problems please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.
"Cut" (Ctrl-X or Shift-Delete) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text and "Paste" (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text in the clipboard at the cursorposition or over the current selection.
"List only Deltas": Files that match in all directories do n't appear in the tree, and hence also not in the destination.
(In the current version, you must do a rescan via menu "Directory"- >" Rescan "yourself, after changing options affecting the directory scan.)
Only items that are not equal in all input directories will be listed and only the changed files are visible. Hence files that are equal in all directories wo n't be copied during a merge and if the destination dir does not contain the files before the merge, you might miss some files later. (This option is likely to be changed in a later version.) Default is off.
The merge-editor below the diff-windows allows you to solve conflicts, while showing you the output you will get.
Note the input selector buttons containing the letters A, B and C in the button bar below the menu bar. When clicking on either input selector button, the lines from that input will be added at the end of the selected group if that group did n't contain that source before. Otherwise the lines from that input will be removed.
& kpager; gives you a thumbnail sketch of all your desktops. It is a handy tool to let you see, resize or close windows on any desktop and move windows around within or between desktops.
& kpager; can show all virtual desktops and the applications within them. It can be used to choose an application or even to move applications within virtual desktops or to others.
The middle button of the mouse can be used for dragging applications within & kpager;. Applications can either be moved within a virtual desktop or to another one.
The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: If it is clicked on the empty background of & kpager;, it only has two items: Configure KPager and Quit. Otherwise, if clicked on a window, there are also the name and the icon of the application, and Minimize, Maximize, To Desktop and Close are displayed. See below for a detailed description of the menu items.
Maximizes the application window to the whole desktop. This item only appears if right clicked on an application window.
Sends the application window to the chosen virtual desktop. This item only appears if right clicked on an application window.
If this box is checked, you can drag windows inside of & kpager; with the & MMB;. Windows can be dragged over the desktop or even to another desktop.
If this box is checked, the names of the desktops are shown in the main view of & kpager;.
If this box is checked, the numbers of the desktops are shown in the main view of & kpager;. If it is checked together with the Show Name box, the name is displayed with ordinals, & eg; 1. Desktop.
If this box is checked, the wallpaper of each desktop - if set - will be shown as backgrounds in & kpager;, too.
If this box is checked, the applications on the desktops are shown in & kpager; as small views. Otherwise, & kpager; will remain empty, just for choosing the virtual desktops.
This group of radio buttons sets the kind of view for the application window views. Plain will show just empty rectangles with the proportions of the application window, Icon will show them with their standard icon and Pixmap with a small view of the contents of the application window. Note that using the pixmap mode is only recommended for very fast machines.
In this group the layout of the & kpager; main view can be set. Classical will show & kpager; in a 2xn grid like pager applications in some other window managers, Horizontal will show the virtual desktops in a horizontal view and Vertical in a vertical row, which may perfectly fit on the side of the desktop.
& kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager applet in the panel. It has the advantage of being resizeable and within this able to show icon or pixmap views of the running applications, move the windows across desktops and run outside of the panel.
Clicking the right mouse button anywhere within & kpager; lets you chose Configure from the context menu for displaying the settings dialog
Currently, you cannot turn that option off within the config dialog, but you can do it manually like this:
Open the file $KDEHOME/ share/ config/ kpagerrc with any text editor like & kedit; or vi. If you have no rights to write that file, you may need to do it as root or contact your system administrator. In this file you will have to add a new key with the name windowTransparentMode with a number as value. Values are:
As & kpager; is part of the & package; package, you will just need an installation of the main & kde; packages.

& kmag; is a screen magnifier. You can use & kmag; to magnify a part of the screen just as you would use a lens to magnify a newspaper fine-print or a photograph. This application is useful for a variety of people: from researchers to artists to web-designers to people with low vision. This document will try to be a complete reference manual for using & kmag;.
& kmag; is a very powerful application with new features being added all the time. It is optimized for use on low processing power machines.
After running & kmag; you will get a window similar to the one show above. The main window of & kmag; shows the magnified (or zoomed) contents. We refer to this window as the zoom window. The zoomed image shown inside the zoom window is captured from a part of the screen. The part of the screen which is magnified is referred to as the selection window.
By default, & kmag; magnifies the region around the mouse cursor into the zoom window (think of it as a moving lens). Alternatively, you can ask & kmag; to magnify an chosen area of the screen into the zoom window (Selection Window Mode), or the area around the mouse cursur to one of the screen edges (e. g. Left Screen Edge Mode).
If you would prefer not to see the mouse cursor in the zoomed image, select Hide Mouse Cursor. Please note that & kmag; cannot yet find out the current cursor shape. Thus, it shows the default & kde; /Qt; cursor.
When in Selection Window Mode, the selection window can be moved and resized. You can also change the position and size of the selection window using the arrow keys on the keyboard, or by clicking into the zoom window:
By keeping the left mouse button pressed and moving the mouse, you can grab and drag the contents of the zoom window. You can also use the arrow keys.
By additionally pressing & Shift; or using the & MMB;, you can move the selection window.
By using this combination, you can resize the selection window. Keep in mind that the top-left corner of the selection window is kept constant and the bottom-right corner is movable.
& kmag; comes with lots of features. It is possible to print the zoomed image directly to a printer, save the image to a file, copy the zoomed image to the clipboard (which can be used later to paste in other applications), rotate the magnification image and more.
Start/ Stop updating of the display. Stopping the update will zero the processing power required (CPU usage)
Select the refresh rate (Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). The higher the rate, the more computing power (CPU) will be needed.
In this mode a selection window is opened. The selected area is shown in a normal window.
& kmag; automatically uses all your default shortcuts for saving file, opening new window, printing, starting/ stopping refresh (reload button in & konqueror;), zoom-in, zoom-out & etc;
kmag, also known as & kmagnifier; is a screen magnifier. You can use & kmagnifier; to magnify a part of the screen just as you would use a lens to magnify a newspaper fine-print or a photograph. This application is useful for a variety of people: from researchers to artists to web-designers to people with low vision.
More detailed user documentation is available from help: / kmag (either enter this & URL; into & konqueror;, or run khelpcenter help: / kmag).

& kmousetool; clicks the mouse whenever the mouse cursor pauses briefly. It was designed to help those with repetitive strain injuries, for whom pressing buttons hurts.
& kmousetool; clicks the mouse whenever the mouse cursor pauses briefly. It was designed to help those with repetitive strain injuries, for whom pressing buttons hurts. It can also drag the mouse, although this takes a bit more practice.
& kmousetool; can eliminate the pain caused by clicking the mouse, and helps many people to use the computer without pain. Unfortunately, some pain can also be caused by simply moving the mouse around the table. If you are experiencing computer-related pain and have n't yet seen a doctor, please do so.
Just to make it absolutely clear: while & kmousetool; can help reduce the pain caused by clicking the mouse, it cannot help any pain caused by moving the mouse. And, like all ergonomic tools, your mileage may vary.
Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; watches as you move the mouse, and when you pause briefly, it clicks.
When Smart Drag is enabled, & kmousetool; pauses after it clicks down; if you move the mouse, it waits until you stop moving before it clicks up. This way, you can both click and drag the mouse. Smart Drag takes a bit more practice, but becomes natural once you get used to it.
The time the mouse has to pause before & kmousetool; clicks. Try increasing this time if it is hard getting used to & kmousetool;
If you enable Smart drag the Drag time (1/ 10 sec): field becomes available. This is the time & kmousetool; waits, after it clicks down, before it clicks back up if you do n't move the mouse.
& kmousetool; now supports strokes. When you enable strokes, a slow move to the right and back, followed by a pause, will generate a right click. A slow move left and back will generate a double click. (Strokes are specified in $KDEHOME / share/ config/ kmousetool_strokes. txt. This file is generated by & kmousetool; the first time it is run, but can be modified afterwards.)
If the sound seems delayed, you can have & kde; speed it up. To do this open the & kcontrolcenter;, click on Sound & Multimedia, then on Sound System, and then select the Sound I/ O tab. At the bottom of the tab, there is an Audio buffer size (response time) adjustment; slide this towards the lower number to speed up the audio response time.
When this is enabled, & kmousetool; will start each time & kde; starts. At the moment, this only works under & kde;. Under GNOME or other Window Managers, see the documentation for the Window Manager itself to see how to start a program automatically when you start the windowing system.
Reset all settings to their state when you opened the dialog, or, if you have already saved a setting with the Apply button, reset all settings to the state when you last pressed Apply
It's best to practice clicking with & kmousetool; using its defaults first. You may especially want to leave Smart Drag disabled at first. Then, once you are comfortable clicking, move on to practicing Smart Drag.
When using the Audible Click, you may need to speed up & kde; 's audio response.
First, keep in mind where it's safe to click & mdash; clicking on gray parts of windows or non-link areas of web browsers wo n't hurt anything, so you can safely rest the mouse over those areas until you need it.
Yes. If your mouse sticks, it means you need to clean your mouse. This is usually easy to do; the trick is that you have to clean not just the mouse's ball, but the rollers that the ball rolls against inside the mouse.
First, you have to remove the ball. The method for doing this varies from mouse to mouse, but it's usually pretty clear how to do this if you look at the bottom of the mouse.
Once you've removed the ball, you should be able to see the rollers on the sides of the hole that contained the ball. The dirt and grime on them can be easily scraped off with a flat blade or with a fingernail.
In some rare situations, the system suspends & kmousetool; when a drag starts; if you are using Smart Drag, this means that & kmousetool; can never finish the drag by clicking up.
This happens when you use & kmousetool; under a non & kde; window manager and then use it to move a window.
The solution is to simply click manually; this resets & kmousetool;, and you can then continue to work normally again.
Problem: When you're typing text, & kmousetool; keeps dropping clicks and moving the cursor away from where you want to type.
Solution: Use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it, but when you're ready to type, park the mouse on a neutral area on the screen. Then, if you bump the mouse, or if it moves a few pixels, any random clicks that it sends wo n't matter. Safe places to park the mouse include the gray areas around toolbars and menus, and on the title bars of windows.
I'm trying to use Smart Drag, but I cannot get the hang of using it to edit text.
Smart Drag is an advanced feature of & kmousetool;, and takes some getting used to. It is very possible to use it to select text, to cut and paste, and use it in almost any situation where you would normally want to drag the mouse. But you probably wo n't be able to do this at first. Here are some suggestions:
Do n't use Smart Drag while you are first learning to use & kmousetool;. Instead, to select text, click at one end of the text, and hold down the shift key while you click at the other end of the text.
Use the Audible Click. This will play a click sound when & kmousetool; clicks down, and this will tell you when the Smart Drag delay is beginning. With practice, you can use Smart Drag without the Audible Click, but it does take a fair amount of practice.
In order to successfully use & kappname;, you need the XTest extension compiled as part of your & X-Window;. This should already be installed on your system; very few systems wo n't have it.
In order to use the Audible Click feature, you will have to have a sound card and speakers, and you will have to have configured the sound card correctly.
& kmousetool; clicks the mouse whenever the mouse cursor pauses briefly. It was designed to help those with repetitive strain injuries, for whom pressing buttons hurts.
& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a specified time for a drag to begin, before unclicking the mouse. This way, you can use it for drag and drop operations as well.
More detailed user documentation is available from help: / kmousetool (either enter this & URL; into & konqueror;, or run khelpcenter help: / kmousetool).

& kmouth; is an application that enables persons that cannot speak to let their computers speak.
& kmouth; is a program that enables persons that cannot speak to let their computers speak. It includes a history of spoken sentences from which the user can select sentences to be re-spoken.
With the first page of the wizard (the left screen shot) you specify the command that shall later be used for the text-to-speech conversion. For more details look into the description of the configuration dialog.
With the second page you select which standard phrase books you need. From the phrase books you later can select often used phrases so that you do not need to type them in. Of course & kmouth; also has an edit dialog for the case that you later want to edit your phrase books.
With the third page (the right screen shot) you define the dictionary for a word completion. & kmouth; will parse the & kde; documentation of the chosen language in order to detect the frequentness of individual words. Optionally you can compare the word list to an OpenOffice. org dictionary in order to only add correctly spelled words to the word completion.
The main window of & kmouth; is fairly simple. It consists basically of an edit field into which you type your sentences (the lower white field in the screen shot) and a history of spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screen shot).
Assuming that you have correctly configured & kmouth; you can use the edit field for entering sentences you want to hear. Once a sentence got spoken it will be appended to the history. From the history you can select sentences to be re-spoken.
By using the menu entry Settings Configure & kmouth;... you open the configuration dialog of & kmouth;. This dialog consists of the pages General Options with the two tabs Text-to-Speech and Preferences, the page Word Completion and the page KTTSD Speech Service
Into the edit field of the Text-to-Speech tab you enter the command for calling the speech synthesizer. With the combo box below the edit field you specify the character encoding that is used for passing the text to the speech synthesizer.
& kmouth; knows two ways of passing the text: If the command expects the text as standard input you select the check box.
The other way is to pass the text as a parameter: Before calling the command & kmouth; replaces certain placeholders with actual content:
Off course the command for speaking texts is dependent on which speech synthesizer you use. Please look into the documentation of your speech synthesizer for the command for speaking texts. You can find examples for the command in the appendix.
By selecting Use KTTSD speech service if possible you tell & kmouth; first to try to send the text to the KTTSD speech service. If this succeeds the other configuration entries on this tab are ignored. The KTTSD speech service is a & kde; daemon which gives & kde; applications a standardized interface for speech synthesis and is currently developed in SVN. It is safe to select this option even if KTTSD is not installed.
With the first combo box, Selection of phrases in the phrase book:, you specify which action is triggered by typing the shortcut of a phrase or by selecting a phrase in the Phrase Book menu or in the phrase book bar.
By selecting Speak Immediately the selected phrase gets immediately spoken and is entered into the history. If you select Insert Into Edit Field the selected phrase is just inserted into the edit field.
With the second combo box, Closing the phrase book edit window:, you specify whether the phrase book gets saved if you just close the phrase book edit window.
By selecting Save Phrase Book the phrase book gets saved. If you select Discard changes the changes are discarded and the phrase book is not saved. If you select Ask Whether to Save & kmouth; will ask you whether it shall save the phrase book.
The Word Completion page contains a list of dictionaries used for the word completion. (kmouth; will display a combo box next to the edit field in the main window if this list contains more than one dictionary. You can use this combo box in order to select the dictionary that actually gets used for the word completion.)
With the buttons on the right side of the page you can add and delete dictionaries, change the order of the dictionaries or export dictionaries to a file. With the edit field and the combo box below the list you can change the name and the language associated with the dictionary.
If you use this source & kmouth; will ask you for the intended language and afterwards parse the & kde; documentation. The frequentness of the individual words is detect by simply counting the occurrences of each word. Optionally you can compare the word list to an OpenOffice. org dictionary in order to only add correctly spelled words to the new dictionary.
You can use this option in order to merge the available dictionaries. & kmouth; will ask you which dictionaries should be merged and how the individual dictionaries should be weighted.
You can use this option in order to create a blank dictionary without any entries. As & kmouth; automatically adds newly typed words to the dictionaries it will learn your vocabulary with the time.
The main area of the phrase book edit window is divided into two parts. Within the upper part the phrase books are displayed in some tree structure.
Within the lower part you may modify a selected item. If you have selected a phrase you can modify the contents of the phrase as well as its shortcut. If you have selected a phrase book you can only change its name.
Actions like adding new phrases and phrase books and deleting selected phrases and phrase books can be done by selecting them in either the menu bar, the toolbar or a pop up menu.
You can change the order of the phrase books and phrases by dragging them to their new places or by using the arrow keys while the & Alt; key is pressed.
Cuts the selected section and puts it to the clipboard. If there is some text selected in the edit field it is placed it on the clipboard. Otherwise the selected sentences in the history (if any) are placed on the clipboard.
Copies the selected section to the clipboard. If there is some text selected in the edit field it is copied to the clipboard. Otherwise the selected sentences in the history (if any) are copied to the clipboard.
Speaks the currently active sentence(s). If there is some text in the edit field it is spoken. Otherwise the selected sentences in the history (if any) are spoken.
When checked, this displays a movable toolbar containing buttons used to initiate frequently used commands. The toolbar is most commonly located at the top of the editor just under the menu. When unchecked the toolbar is hidden. Clicking on the striated grip and dragging allows the user to move the bar.
When checked, this displays a small bar at the bottom of the main window containing information about the status of & kmouth;. When unchecked the status bar is hidden.
When checked, this displays a movable phrasebook bar containing buttons for the phrasebook entries. The phrasebook bar is most commonly located at the top of the editor just under the toolbar. When unchecked the phrasebook bar is hidden. Clicking on the striated grip and dragging allows the user to move the bar.
Most likely you did not configure correctly (or not at all?) the text-to-speech command. Use Settings Configure & kmouth;..., open the page General Options and enter the command for speaking texts on the tab Text-to-Speech. (See section about the configuration dialog for the speech synthesizer for more details.)
Festival is a text-to-speech system written from the University of Edinburgh. It currently supports English, Spanish and Welsh speech. Its license allows to use and distribute Festival free of charge without restrictions.
In order to create the command line example for the text-to-speech configuration we assume that Festival is installed in the directory / usr/ local/ festival/. The command for speaking texts then is as follows:
FreeTTS is a speech synthesizer written entirely in the & Java ;™ programming language. It currently only has support for English pronounciation. Its license allows to use and distribute FreeTTS free of charge without restrictions.
In order to create the command line example for the text-to-speech configuration we assume that FreeTTS is installed in the directory / usr/ local/ freetts/. The command for speaking texts then one of the following three examples:
For the third example the option Send the data as standard input must be enabled. (This one is the preferred example for the use with FreeTTS.)
MBROLA is a speech synthesizer for a large number of languages. It converts a list of phonemes to a wave file, so you need some other tool to convert the text into a list of phonemes. The license of MBROLA allows to use and MBROLA free of charge for non-commercial, non-military applications.
For our example we will use Hadifax in order to convert German texts into a list of phonemes suitable for MBROLA. We will assume that Hadifax and MBROLA are installed to / usr/ local/ hadifax/ and / usr/ local/ mbrola/.
Unfortunately Hadifax tends to swallow the last character of the text, so we may want to add an additional character to the text. The complete command is therefore more complex than the previous examples:
(cat -; echo quot; & quot;) _BAR_ / usr/ local/ hadifax/ txt2pho -f _BAR_ / usr/ local/ mbrola/ mbrola -e / usr/ local/ mbrola/ de1/ de1 - / tmp/ tmp. wav; artsplay / tmp/ tmp. wav; rm / tmp/ tmp. wav
All parts of this command need to be written into one line. The option Send the data as standard input must be enabled.
The & kde; Text-to-Speech Daemon (KTTSD) is a & kde; wide text-to-speech service which gives & kde; applications a standardized interface for speech synthesis and is currently developed in SVN. It uses plug-ins in order to support various text-to-speech systems.
As the configuration of the speech synthesizer is done in KTTSD the only & kmouth; -specific option you need to activate is Use KTTSD speech service if possible.
Of course you need to configure KTTSD. You may do this with the configuration page KTTSD Speech Service that is added to the configuration dialog of & kmouth; if KTTSD is installed.
In order to successfully use & kmouth;, you need a speech synthesizer (and of course & kde; 3. x). & kmouth; uses about 15 MB of memory to run (plus the amount of memory needed by your speech synthesizer), but this may vary depending on your platform and configuration.
& kmouth; is an application that enables persons that cannot speak to let their computers speak. It includes a history of spoken sentences from which the user can select sentences to be re-spoken.
Note that & kmouth; does not include speech synthesizer. Instead it requires a speech synthesizer installed in the system.
More detailed user documentation is available from help: / kmouth (either enter this & URL; into & konqueror;, or run khelpcenter help: / kmouth).
& ktts; - the & kde; Text-to-Speech system - is a plugin based service that allows any & kde; (or non-kde;) application to speak using the & DBus; interface.
& ktts; is a subsysem within & kde; for producing Text-to-Speech (TTS). It provides a common API for & kde; programmers to give TTS capabilities to their applications. It provides some nice capabilities for end users as well.
Speak all or part of the text in & kate; text editor, including instances where & kate; is embedded in another & kde; application.
Speech is spoken via speech-dispatcher, so any speech-dispatcher backend can be used (espeak, festival, & etc;)
Permit generation of speech from the command line (or via shell scripts) using the & qdbus; utility.
FUTURE: Provide support for speech markup languages, such as VoiceXML, Sable, & Java; Speech Markup Language (JSML), and Speech Markup Meta-language (SMML).
the & kde; Text-to-Speech Daemon, which is a non-GUI; application that provides TTS services to applications via & DBus;.
a & GUI; application for configuring and controlling kttsd. kttsmgr sits in the system tray.
A plugin for the & konqueror; web browser that permits you to speak all or a portion of the text on a web page.
A plugin for the & kate; text editor that permits you to speak all or a portion of a text file.
In addition to the & kde; Bugzilla database (http: / /bugs. kde. org/), discussions for & ktts; currently take place in the kde-accessibility mailing list. Subscribe at https: / /mail. kde. org/ mailman/ listinfo/ kde-accessibility. Developers also hang out in IRC (irc. kde. org, channel #kde-accessibility).
Before you can use & ktts;, you must install speech-dispatcher and make sure it is working. See.
If this is the first time running kttsmgr, or if you have not yet configured any talkers, the Talkers screen appears. See. If you have already configured at least one talker, the General screen appears. See.
Most text-to-speech (TTS) synthesizers offer multiple languages and voices and may offer multiple speaking genders, volumes, and rates. You may configure more than one instance of a synthesizer. Each combination of language, synthesizer, voice, gender, volume, and rate is called a talker. You should configure at least one talker before you use & ktts; otherwise speech-dispatcher will use a default voice.
Multiple talkers for the same synthesizer is similar to multiple print queues for a single physical printer.
When you click the Talkers tab in kttsmgr, the Talkers screen appears. This screen also automatically appears if you start kttsmgr and you have not yet configured any talkers.
All the configured Talkers are listed here. Highest priority Talkers are listed at the top. The top-most talker will be used to do the speaking when an application does not specify a talker.
Click on a talker in the list to highlight it and click this button to remove it.
Click on a talker in the list to highlight it and click this button to change its configuration. See below.
Click on a talker in the list to highlight it and click this button to move it down one row in the list. The lower a talker appears in the list, the lower its priority.
Click one of these buttons to apply the changes you have made to the running & ktts; system.
Choose the voice type here, there are three Male, three Female, one Male Child and one Female Child voices to choose from.
When you click here your new talker will appear in the list in the Talkers screen. Click the Edit button to edit the talker's configuration.
You are almost ready to begin using & ktts;. Now go back to the General tab and check the Enable Text-to-Speech System (KTTSD) box. This will start the & kde; TTS Daemon. See. You may now begin using & ktts; to speak text. Click the Jobs tab to create and manage text jobs. See.
Once you have configured at least one talker, you can start the & kde; Text-to-Speech System. Click on the General tab. The General screen appears. You can also set some general options on this screen.
Check this box to activate the & ktts; system. This starts the & kde; TTS Daemon (KTTSD). If KTTSD starts successfully, the Jobs tab will appear. Once KTTSD has been started, you can begin creating and speaking text jobs. See. Unchecking will stop KTTSD and deactivate the & kde; TTS system.
When kttsmgr exits, & ktts; keeps running if the Enable Text-to-Speech System (KTTSD) box is checked.
When this box is checked, and kttsmgr automatically appears in the system tray whenever speaking, it will also disappear automatically when speaking has finished.
The buttons in this row permit you to stop, cancel, pause and resume the current text job.
The buttons in this row permit you to speak the text currently in the & kde; clipboard, or open a text file for speaking. You can also change the talker for a job.
When you click OK or Apply, all changes to settings on other screens are applied (if any).
The Jobs tab only appears when KTTSD is running. If you do not see the Jobs tab, click on the General tab and check the Enable Text-to-Speech (KTTSD) box.
While running the & kde; & konqueror; web browser, you can speak the text of the web page displayed. First ensure that & ktts; is running. Highlight the text you want spoken and choose Tools Speak Text on the main menu. After a moment, the highlighted text should begin speaking.
It is almost always a good idea to highlight the text on the web page you want spoken. You can skip this step, but you will hear a lot of & HTML; headers and other invisible tags spoken.
While running the & kde; Advanced Text Editor (kate;), you can speak the text displayed. First ensure that & ktts; is running. Highlight the text you want spoken and choose Tools Speak Text on the main menu. After a moment, the highlighted text should begin speaking.
This also works when & kate; is running embedded in another application, such as & konqueror; or & quanta;.
KNotify is the notification subsystem within & kde;, which alerts you to events you configure within the & kde; system. You can configure & ktts; to speak text notifications.
For example, & konversation;, a & kde; IRC application, permits you to configure a wide variety of notifications. For instance, you can tell & konversation; to notify you whenever a message appears in an IRC channel with your nickname in it. Together with & ktts; you can have & kde; speak the text of the IRC message to you.
In general, if a & kde; application supports KNotify, a Notifications menu item will appear under the application's Settings menu. The specifics for configuring each application with KNotify vary from application to application.
String Replacer filters are a good way to clean up messages sent from applications if they are mispronounced or misspoken in & ktts;. The kmail. xml file, which comes with & ktts;, is a good example. It removes br, and b tags from the & kmail; notification messages and also removes the phrase / local/ inbox/, since this may be safely assumed in most cases. See.
Filters are an advanced feature of & ktts;. For the basic operation of & ktts;, they are not needed.
Filters are used to pre-process text before it is sent to speech-dispatcher. They are useful for enhancing speech, substituting for misspoken words or abbreviations, choosing the appropriate language and talker to do the speaking, or working around certain limitations of speech synthesizers and their voices.
To understand how to use filters, it is helpful to first understand how text is processed by speech-dispatcher. Text spoken by & ktts; is of four possible types.
Screen Reader Output has the highest priority. It is reserved for use by Screen Reader applications. Screen Reader Output preempts all other messages, causing those jobs to pause. Once the Screen Reader Output has been spoken, the preempted messages will automatically resume.
Warnings are the next highest priority. It is reserved for high-priority messages, such as "CPU is over-heating." A Warning will preempt Messages and regular text, causing those jobs to pause. Once the Warning has been spoken, the preempted messages will automatically resume.
Messages are the next highest priority. A Message will preempt regular text jobs. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses Messages. For example, while reading out long text from a web page, & kmouth; can be used to greet someone who walks into the room. & kde; Notifications are also Messages (see).
The rest are ordinary Text Jobs. Any job you initiate from the Jobs tab is a Text Job. KSayit is an example of an application that uses Text Jobs. Text Jobs are intended for longer speech output that is not urgent.
All four kinds of jobs are queues, except for Screen Reader Output. If a Screen Reader Output is sent from an application while & ktts; is speaking another Screen Reader Output, the speaking message is stopped and discarded.
The first thing you must know about filters is that they are never applied to Screen Reader Output. They are applied to Warnings, Messages, and Text jobs, and also & kde; notifications (KNotify).
Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. There are currently three kinds of filters.
Filters are implemented using a plugin architecture. In the future, there may be additional kinds of filters.
String Replacer filters substitute pieces of text with other text. The replaced pieces are matched either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; comes with pre-defined String Replacer filters for speaking abbreviations, speaking chat emoticons, such as ": -)", or reformatting notification messages from & konversation; or & kmail; into a more understandable form.
& XML; Transformers use an & XML; Style Language - Transforms (XSLT) file to convert & XML; of one format to another format. & ktts; comes with a couple of XSLT files for converting & XHTML; into SSML.
Talker Choosers permit you redirect jobs to a talker based on the contents of the text, or upon the application that sent it to & ktts;. For example, if you have configured a female talker in the Talkers tab, you can direct text coming from KSayIt to that talker. See.
Each of these kinds of filters has configurable rules for when the filter should apply itself to the text to be spoken. If the filter determines that it should not apply itself, the text is passed on to the next filter unaltered.
When a Text Job, Message, Warning, or & kde; Notification message is sent to & ktts;, it passes through each of the enabled filters you have configured in the screen below. The order is from top to bottom.
This is the list of configured ordinary filters. If unchecked, the filter is inactive and will be bypassed. Filters are applied in the order specified here, top to bottom.
Click here to add a new filter. You will be prompted for the kind of filter to add. After choosing the kind, see the configuration dialogs below.
You configure String Replacer filters by supplying a list of words or regular expressions to be matched. When the matched words or regular expressions are found in the text, each is replaced by a substitute string you supply.
Enter a name for your filter. Use any name you like that distinquishes it from all other filters.
This is the list of words and regular expressions. The filter searches for matches on each string in the Match column, replacing the matched string with the string in the Replace With column. The list is processed in the order displayed, top to bottom.
Click here to move the currently highlighted word or regular expression up or down in the list.
Use these buttons to load a list of words or regular expression from a file, save the current list to a file, or clear the entire list. When loading from a file, the items in the file are appended to the existing list.
If not blank, the filter will apply itself only if the job's talker language matches the language you enter here. Click the button to display a list of languages. You may select more than one language by pressing & Ctrl; while clicking.
If not blank, the filter will apply itself only if the text came from one of the applications listed. You may enter more than one application separated by commas. Example: konversation, kmail
You can discover the Application ID of running programs using the qdbus; program. You should leave the & DBus; numbers out. For example, if & qdbus; shows an Application ID of kopete-3432, you would just enter kopete.
The String Replacer filter will only apply itself to the text if all non-blank conditions are met in the Apply This Filter When box. If all the boxes are blank, the filter will apply to all text.
When matching words, the String Replacer filter internally uses a regular expression of the form \\s word \\s. In other words, the word must have word boundaries (spaces) on either side of it.
A discussion on how to write regular expressions is outside the scope of this handbook. If you have the & kde; Regular Expression editor installed, there is a button available on the Add or Edit screens that will assist you at constructing regular expressions. The & kde; Regular Expression Editor is part of the kdeutils package.
The & XML; Transformer filter uses XSLT files to transform & XML; from one format to another. XSLT, the & XML; Style Language - Transforms, is a W3C standard language for performing such transformations. It can only be used on well-formed & XML;. You must have the xsltproc utility installed.
Specify the path to the xsltproc utility. If xsltproc is in your environment PATH, simply enter xsltproc.
Talker Chooser filters are used to direct the text to a desired talker configured in the Talker tab, or to any talker having specified attributes. For example, you can specify that text coming from kmail should be spoken using a talker configured with a female voice. See.
Just before & ktts; begins sending text to each of the filters, it picks a talker to speak the text. The talker chosen is based on the talker attributes specified by the application that sent the text to & ktts; and the attributes of the talkers that you have configured on the Talkers tab. The Talker Chooser filter permits you to override the chosen talker.
If not blank, the filter will apply itself only if the text contains the entered regular expression. If it is installed, click the browse button to launch the & kde; Regular Expression Editor to assist you at entering the regular expression.
For better performance, try to "anchor" the regular expression to the start of the string. In other words, start your regular expression with < ![CDATA[^]] >.
Specify the attributes of the talker you prefer to speak the text here. If the text meets the filter conditions above, a talker will be chosen that most closely matches the attributes you specify here. Click the button at the right to display the Select Talker screen.
Use these buttons to save your Talker Chooser settings, load settings from a saved file, or clear all the settings.
The Talker Chooser filter will only apply itself to the text if all non-blank conditions are met in the Apply This Filter When box. You must fill in at least one of the boxes.

I have the & HTML; & XML; Transformer filter configured, but web pages are not spoken at all using the Festival plugin.
Due to a bug in Festival 1.95 beta, you must install the rab_diphone (British male) voice for SABLE to work at all, even if you are not using that voice to speak the web pages. Also, make sure the xsltproc utility is installed and in the PATH.
Certain characters or punctuation seem to be producing errors in the synthesizer, making it skip entire sentences, or pronounce gibberish. What can I do?
First, make sure the Character encoding option in the talker's configuration dialog is properly set for the language. If certain words or characters are causing problems, a String Replacer filter might help. See.

Speech synthesis engines used by & ktts; have their own licenses. See each engine's documentation or website for details. Some voices also have their own licensing.
If you have access to the & kde; code repository, you can download & ktts; by checking out the kdeaccessibility module. & ktts; will be found in the kttsd folder. You can also download tarballs of the kdeaccessibility source code from ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde/
Most languages, check http: / /espeak. sourceforge. net/ languages. html for the current list of supported languages
American English, British, Spanish, German, Finnish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Italian, French Canadian, Kiswahili, Zulu, and Ibibio
It also works with any synthesis engine that can be run from a command in a & konsole;.
The languages listed above may not be comprehensive or up-to-date. Check the specifications for each engine for a complete list of supported languages. Also check the & ktts; website for additional information that might not have made it into this handbook.
speech-dispatcher uses a flexible plugin architecture for speech synthesis engines. If you want to enhance & ktts; to support another engine, contact the development team.
The xsltproc utility is needed for SSML support and for the & XML; Transformer filter, but not required. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.
In order to compile & ktts;, you must have a recent (kde; 4.4 or greater) copy of the & kde; development files, including kdelibs and the development files for speech-dispatcher.
If you downloaded the & ktts; source from the kdeaccessibility code repository module, or downloaded the nightly tarball, use the following commands to compile and install.
Make sure speech-dispatcher is working with your speech synthesis engine before using & ktts;. The shell script spd-conf can be used for that.
& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is a first attempt at porting & ktts; to use speech-dispatcher. In the future kttsmgr will be able to configure speech-dispatcher directly without spd-conf.
Long text is parsed into sentences. User may backup by sentence or paragraph, replay, pause, and stop playing.
When applications send text to & ktts;, they may specify the attributes of the preferred talker to do the synthesis. For example, an application may request an English language female talker. If you have configured a talker with both the English language and female gender, that talker will be used, otherwise the closest matching talker will be automatically picked. To learn more about how & ktts; picks talkers, see.
When you click the Add button on the Talkers tab and add a talker that cannot automatically configure itself, or click the Edit button, the Talker Configuration screen appears. Each speech synthesis plugin has a different Talker Configuration screen. The following is an example for configuring the Festival Interactive plugin. For specifics for each kind of plugin, see.
Specify the path to the Festival executable program. If Festival is in your PATH environment variable, just enter festival.
Select a character encoding for text sent to Festival. For voices that are known to & ktts;, this setting will be picked for you automatically. In general, western languages use ISO 8859-1. Eastern European languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.
Use these controls to set the volume, talking speed, and pitch (tone) of the synthesized speech. If any of these are disabled (grayed), the chosen voice does not support changing them.
Some voices, such as the MultiSyn voices, are so large that they require several seconds to load. Checking this box will cause them to be loaded when KTTSD is started, thereby saving time (at the expense of using more memory) before the first sentence is synthesized.
If this box is disabled, you have not yet configured any talkers (or you forgot to click the Apply button). See.
When this box is checked, the kttsmgr screen appears when you start kttsmgr. If unchecked, the kttsmgr icon appears in the system tray when kttsmgr is started, but the screen does not appear. Click the icon in the system tray to make the screen appear.
When this box is checked, and kttsmgr is not already running, it will appear in the system tray whenever KTTSD is speaking. This gives you an opportunity to stop or otherwise manage the speaking.
All of the text jobs currently in the queue are listed here, together with the application that queued the job, the current job state, number of sentences in the job, and current sentence number. The Talker ID corresponds to the ID column on the Talkers screen.
The buttons in this row permit you to advance or rewind by sentence within the job selected in the list above. (Not all jobs have multiple parts.)
When you click OK, all changes to settings on other screens are applied (if any) and kttsmgr minimizes to the system tray. Click on the icon in the system tray to restore the screen.
If you do not have the & arts; audio subsystem installed, but you do have ALSA, GStreamer, or aKode installed, click the Audio tab. See.
Only Text jobs are listed and controlled on this screen. Screen Reader Output, Warnings, and Messages are not displayed. For more information about & ktts; message types, see.
Select the method of audio output here. If a component is is grayed, either & ktts; was compiled without that support for that audio plugin, or & ktts; was unable to load the necessary libraries.
If GStreamer or aKode is selected for audio output, choose the audio sink method here. If no sinks are listed, you need to install at least one. If ALSA is selected, choose the PCM device here. See.
Adjust the speed of talking here. 50% is approximately twice as slow as normal while 200% is approximately twice as fast. You must have the sox utility installed for this setting to work.
Be sure to click Apply to apply the new settings to the running & ktts; system.
The list of ALSA devices includes all the ALSA PCM devices and plugins configured in your system. Many of the choices will not work. You must experiment to find a device that works for you. If in doubt, choose default.
This screen permits you to specify special actions to be taken whenever a text job is interrupted by another, higher priority, message. There are four kinds of speech jobs that & ktts; handles:
Screen Reader Output has the highest priority. It is reserved for use by Screen Reader applications. Screen Reader Output preempts all other messages, causing those jobs to pause. Once the Screen Reader Output has been spoken, the preempted jobs will automatically resume.
Warnings are the next highest priority. It is reserved for high-priority messages, such as "CPU is over-heating." A Warning will preempt Messages and regular text, causing those jobs to pause. Once the Warning has been spoken, the preempted jobs will automatically resume.
Messages are the next highest priority. A Message will preempt regular text jobs. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses Messages. For example, while reading out long text from a web page, & kmouth; can be used to greet someone who walks into the room.
When a text job is interrupted by a Message, Warning, or Screen Reader Output, & ktts; will add the audio outputs on this screen to the stream.
This audio file is sounded whenever a regular text job is interrupted. If both a Pre-sound and a Pre-message are specified, the Pre-sound is sounded before the Pre-message.
The settings on this screen apply only to regular text jobs. Messages, Warnings, and Screen Reader Outputs have no special actions when they are preempted by a higher-priority message.
To enable & ktts; to speak KNotify text notifications, start kttsmgr and click the Notifications tab. The Notifications screen appears.
Check this box to enable speaking of & kde; notifications. If unchecked, everything else on this screen is disabled and & ktts; does not speak any notifications.
When checked, any application that sends an event with a sound will not be spoken by & ktts;.
Use these buttons to add or delete application events from the list below. When you click the Add button, a screen appears in which you select the application and event you want to add to the list.
This event will speak the message & konversation; sends when someone mentions your nickname in an Internet Relay Chat message.
For all events not otherwise specified in the list, no action will be taken in & ktts;.
Use this box to specify what & ktts; should do when it receives an event. Your choices are:
If the action is Speak custom text, enter the text of the message you would like spoken here. Within the message, you may use the following substitution strings:
You may specify the attributes of the desired talker to speak the notification message here. default will use the topmost talker listed in the Talkers screen. See.
Notice there are three levels of events. If an action for a specific event of a specific application is specified, that action is taken. Otherwise, if an action for all other events of a specific application is specified, that action is taken. Otherwise, the action specified for all other events under Default (all other events) is taken.
The event all notifications for application Default (all other events) may not be deleted from the list. For the default all other events, you may specify the kind of notifications that are spoken, as follows:
Use the Save button to save your notification settings to a file. Use the Load button to load saved settings from a file. The loaded events are merged with existing events in the list. If you want to start with an empty event list, click the Clear button first. All events except for all notifications will be erased.
The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for marking up text for speech output. It provides tags for controlling voices, rate of speech, volume, gender, and pitch (tone). It also provides tags for controlling how words are spoken, for instance spelling out abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, which is also a W3C standard.
At this time, & ktts; provides limited and very basic support for SSML. It currently has the following restrictions.
You must install the rab_diphone (British male) voice, as this is the default voice Festival uses when speaking SSML.
If the Speed or Pitch settings in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, it will usually cause the SSML text to be spoken in a monotone.

There are two kinds of filters -- ordinary filters and Sentence Boundary Detector (SBD) filters. SBDs break text up into individual sentences. This allows & ktts; to begin speaking faster because it need only synthesize the first sentence; not the entire Text Job. It also permits you to advance or rewind by sentence in the Jobs tab, or to stop or pause Text Jobs when the speech synthesizer does not directly support stopping of speech.
These are the Sentence Boundary Detector filters. When you first start & ktts;, the Standard Sentence Boundary Detector is automatically configured for you. You can change this filter's configuration, or add additional Sentence Boundary Detectors, but we advise beginners not to change them.
The easiest way to learn how to configure Talker Choosers is to experiment. Disable the Talker Chooser and submit some text. In the Jobs tab, note the talker that & ktts; chooses. Click the Change Talker button, enter some attributes, and try again to see how the choice is affected. Of course, you must have more than one talker configured for the Talker Chooser to do anything.
allows & ktts; to begin speaking faster because it need only synthesize the first sentence, rather than the entire block of text, which might be very long, and
allows you to pause or stop Text Jobs in the Jobs tab even if the speech synthesizer is not capable of being stopped.
For these reasons, the Standard Sentence Boundary Detector filter is automatically configured the first time you run kttsmgr and cannot be disabled (although you can remove it). We advise you not to modify this filter unless you know what you are doing.
SBD filters work by matching an end-of-sentence regular expression and inserting Tab (decimal 8) characters at the sentence boundaries. (All Tab characters are automatically stripped from text before filtering begins.) Note that the Standard SBD preserves the sentence punctuation.
SBD filters are never applied to & kde; Notification messages (knotify), Warnings, Messages, or Screen Reader Outputs.
If you accidentally remove the Standard Sentence Boundary Detectory filter, you can get it back by loading the standard_sbdrc file, which comes with & ktts;.
Using the Select Talker screen, you may override application talker settings. The screen is displayed
Use the default talker (topmost in the Talkers tab). In other words, no talker attributes are specified.
Use the closest matching talker having all the attributes of a configured talker. If you do n't delete or modify the talker's settings, & ktts; will pick that specific talker. If you delete or modify the talker's settings, then & ktts; will pick the closest matching talker having the talker's original attributes.
Choose the method for entering the desired talker attributes by clicking one of these radio buttons.
Choose the attributes of the desired talker here. Leave an attribute blank if you do not care about that attribute.
Check this box if you wish the attribute to be "preferred" over other attributes. You may check more than one box.
Since language is a critical factor in making speech understandable, it is always a preferred attribute. It is rare that you will use this attribute. The only time you might specify the language attribute is when you know a specific application sends text in a language different from your desktop.
To clear all the attributes in the Use closest matching Talker having section, first click the Use default Talker radio button, then click the Use closest matching Talker having radio button.
In this case, 0 refers to the last text job queued. You may also specify a specific job number. (If no job number is given, a 0 is required.)
kttsmgr immediately crashes when I start it. I compiled with debug support and I do n't even get a backtrace.
GStreamer has crashed taking & ktts; down with it. You most likely need to "register" GStreamer. For GStreamer 0.8x, the command is gst-register-0.8. If this does n't solve the problem, you may have an incompatible version of GStreamer installed. You could try upgrading or uninstalling GStreamer.
ALSA audio output is not working if I am playing music in another application at the same time. When I pause a text job, & ktts; freezes. I notice "unable to open PCM" in the & konsole; output.
You have the ALSA device contention problem, which prevents opening more than one PCM device at one time. See the ALSA website (dmix) for possible solutions. www. alsa-project. org
I have an additional Festival voice I downloaded from the Internet. I installed it, and I can use it in Festival, but it does not show up in kttsmgr.
Edit file $KDEHOME/ share/ apps/ kttsd/ festivalint/ voices to add the new voice. The other entries can be used as a guide. If you successfully add a voice, please send a patch to the developers along with the & URL; from which you obtained the voice file.
There is a Speed setting on the Audio tab. For this to work, you must have the sox utility installed and available in the PATH. Some synthesis plugins, such as Festival Interactive also provide a Speed setting in the talker configuration dialog. Depending upon the voice used, it may or may not be enabled.
The speed settings are ignored when & ktts; is speaking & HTML;. (This is because the & HTML; is converted into SSML, which has its own "rate" tags.) Either disable the & HTML; & XML; Transformer filter (see), or if you are brave, edit the. xsl file in the & HTML; to SSML Transformer filter and increase the default talking rate.
I cannot get web pages to speak in a female voice. I have female Festival talker configured, but & ktts; always speaks web pages in a male voice.
As of Festival 1.95 beta, the SABLE GENDER tag does n't seem to be working. To keep Festival from producing errors, the SSML to SABLE. xsl file strips the gender tags out. The same applies to voice tags as well.
I added a String Replacer filter of my own and now & ktts; will not allow me to rewind or advance by sentence. On the Jobs tab, it claims each job has only one sentence. What did I do wrong?
You must not filter out sentence punctuation characters (period, question mark, exclamation mark, colon, and semicolon). For these characters, use a Sentence Boundary Detector filter instead.
ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is installed with most & Linux; systems. (www. alsa-project. org)
GStreamer version 0.8.7 or greater. Note: Be sure to register your GStreamer plugins by running the gst-register command prior to using GStreamer in & ktts;. (http: / /gstreamer. freedesktop. org)
Some users experience device contention with ALSA. If your system has this problem, you will not be able to simultaneously play music while speaking. & ktts; will also freeze if you pause a text job and then start another. See the ALSA website (dmix) for possible solutions.
As of July 2005, aKode does not support a true pause capability. When you pause a text job in & ktts; it will finish speaking the current sentence.
The sox audio utility is needed for adjusting overall speech speed, but not required. Debian users can install sox with the command apt-get install sox. Sox is included on most & Linux; distribution CDs.
If you downloaded & ktts; as a tarball, log in as a normal user and untar the tarball to a suitable folder, change to that folder, and enter the following commands.
In & kde; 4, the & arts; plugin will likely be removed or at least not built by default.
The following speech synthesizer plugins are all built by default. Some of them are runtime only dependent upon non-free software. (Non-free according to Debian Policy). The "Configure Option to not build" column shows the configure command to not build the plugin:
By default, the commands above will install & ktts; to / opt/ kde3. If this folder is not in your $KDEDIRS path, you may need to add a --prefix= target option. For example,
On Debian systems, / usr/ local is the usual place to install applications compiled from source code.
cd kdeaccessibility echo kttsd > inst-apps make -f Makefile. cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install
Make sure your speech synthesis engine is working before using & ktts;. Follow the instructions that came with the engine.
Festival is one of the best free and open source TTS engines available. Voice quality is generally good and there are quite a few languages and voices supported. For many voices, you can control the volume, speed of the generated speech, and pitch (tone) from & ktts;.
You will need to install at least one language. Follow the instructions that come with Festival. If you will be speaking web pages, you must install the rab_diphone (British Male) voice.
You must compile an additional module for these voices, therefore, you must have the Festival source code. The German voices have limited distribution.
You must have Festival 1.95 beta or later to use this voice. The voice is still in early development. Untar to festival/ lib/ voices/ russian/. When you configure the Russian talker, the voice code is msu_ru_nsh_diphone. Be sure to select an 8-bit cryllic encoding, such as KOI8-R.
Festival is typically included with & Linux; distributions. Check your distro CDs to see if it is included.
When using the Polish, Hungarian, or Czech languages, be sure the Encoding option is set to ISO 8859-2.
When using the Russian voice, be sure the Encoding option is set to an 8-bit cryllic encoding, such as KOI8-R.
Festival can be used in combination with the & mbrola; synthesizer. In this mode, Festival does the lexical analysis and & mbrola; produces the audio. The & mbrola; binary and & mbrola; voice files can be downloaded from
Note that & mbrola; is not a complete Text-to-Speech system. & mbrola; synthesizes speech from diphone files. You must have additional software that can produce the diphones. When combined with Festival, Festival produces the diphones needed by & mbrola;. txt2pho can also be used to produce diphones from German text. See for more information.
In this method, additional wrapper code is added to Festival to enable speech synthesis using & mbrola; voice files. Note that the & mbrola; voice files are not installed in the & mbrola; folder tree. Instead, they are installed in the festival/ lib/ folder tree. For instructions, see
IMS German Festival is a modified version of Festival that uses German & mbrola; voices. It works with either Festival version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). First install Festival and & mbrola;, if you have not already done so. Next, download IMS German Festival, from
Follow the instructions in the README that comes with the download. (Note, if using in combination with Festival 2.0, it is not necessary to apply the fixes tarball, but you must still rebuild festival.) Finally, add the following lines to the festival/ lib/ siteinit. scm file.
(voice-location "german_de1_os" "/ usr/ local/ mbrola/ de1" "German Female, IMS Festival de1") (voice-location "german_de2_os" "/ usr/ local/ mbrola/ de2" "German Male, IMS Festival de2") (voice-location "german_de3_os" "/ usr/ local/ mbrola/ de3" "German Female, IMS Festival de3")
On some systems, the file you edit is / etc/ festival. scm. Only add the lines that correspond to the German voices you have installed. Substitute the correct path for / usr/ local/ mbrola/. Also note that (at the time of this writing) IMS German Festival does not work with the de4, de5, or de6 German voices.
This method uses some special code to enable speech synthesis using Festival with an & mbrola; Czech voice. To install, first download and install Festival and & mbrola;, and make sure both are working. Next, download Festival-Czech from
Untar the download to a suitable folder and make the lexicon. The Festival executable must be in your PATH.
Download the cz2 voice file from the & mbrola; website, and unzip it in the & mbrola; folder.
(set! czech-lexicon-file "/ usr/ local/ festival-czech/ czech-lexicon. out") (set! load-path (cons "/ usr/ local/ festival-czech" load-path)) (require'czech) (set! czech-mbrola_database "/ usr/ local/ mbrola/ cz2/ cz2") (set! mbrola_progname "/ usr/ local/ mbrola/ mbrola") (voice-location "czech_mbrola_cz2" "/ usr/ local/ mbrola/ cz2" "Czech Male, MBROLA") (require'czech-mbrola)
Festival Lite is a free open source engine that currently supports a limited number of voices and languages. It is light weight, but sacrifices voice quality somewhat. You cannot control the pitch, volume, or speed of this engine from & ktts;.
flite is typically included with & Linux; distributions. Check your distro CDs to see if it is included.
Hadifix is a two-stage synthesis engine based on diphones. The txt2pho utility converts text into diphones and the & mbrola; engine synthesizes the diphones to sound. Voice quality is good, but language support is currently somewhat limited. You can control the voice, pitch, speed, and volume from kttsmgr.
Download at least one german language file from the & mbrola; site. Unzip to the / usr/ local/ mbrola folder.
Either copy txt2phorc to ~/. txt2phorc or to / etc/ txt2pho. Note that you drop the "rc" in file name.
On the Configure Talker screen, configure a voice and the paths to & mbrola; and txt2pho.
Epos is a free Czeck and Slovak open source engine. It is light weight, but sacrifices voice quality somewhat. You cannot control the volume of this engine from & ktts;.
Start kttsmgr. On the Talkers tab, click the Add button. Choose Czeck or Slovak language and Epos TTS Synthesis System. If the epos server executable and client are not in your PATH, specify the paths to these executables in the Configure Talker screen. The options boxes permit you to pass additional options to the server and client. In a & konsole;, type epos -h or say -h for information.
FreeTTS is a free open source speech engine written in & Java;, which means that you must have the & Java; Virtual Machine software installed on your system to use it. It currently has limited voice and language support. You cannot control the pitch, volume, or speed of this engine from & ktts;.
The command plugin permits you to use & ktts; with any speech synthesis engine that can be run as a command in a & konsole;.
Ideally, you should use a command that synthesizes to a temporary audio (wav) file, rather than send the speech directly to the audio device.
This manual explains how to install and use & knetworkconf;, a module for & kcontrolcenter; that enables management of Network Interfaces, Routing and DNS properties.
The & kcontrolcenter; provides users with a single integrated interface from which to manage a wide variety of system and desktop settings and preferences. & kcontrolcenter; can be started by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;.
The & knetworkconf; package was developed to enable users to manage TCP/ IP networking settings in the same way they manage other system settings from & kcontrolcenter;. Tasks enabled by & knetworkconf; provide users with a simple interface from which to perform the following tasks:
Once installed a new module called Network Settings is displayed in the & kcontrolcenter;. To start the Network Settings (knetworkconf;) module select kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Settings in the & kmenu;.
It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; cannot install networking hardware. As such physical devices and their drivers must be properly installed and configured in order for & knetworkconf; to display the device and enable management of networking properties.
In most cases drivers for networking hardware and other devices are installed and configured while installing & Linux;. If you add networking hardware after installation, you will have to define the drivers to be loaded by editing one of the following files depending on your kernel version:
The Network Settings module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; index. When started the Network Settings module attempts to automatically detect the platform running on the system.
When the platform is not a recognized you will be prompted to manually select the platform. Select a platform from the list that most closely corresponds to your distro and its release. Check the Do n't ask again option to make this choice permanent. Next time Network Settings is started the system will automatically default to the selected platform option.
To manage the system network settings you must enter administrator mode. Prior to this all options will be grayed, meaning you can only navigate the interface and view properties. Editing is disabled. To enter administrator mode click the Administrator Mode button located bottom left of the module. Enter your password when prompted.
Once in administrator mode all the modules functionality is enable. Functionality is organized into three tabs:
The Network Interfaces tab is used to manage the network communications devices installed on the system. All available networking devices are listed. From the Network Interfaces tab the following tasks can be accomplished:
The properties of listed network devices can be configured by selecting the required device from the list then clicking the Configure Interface... button to display the Configure Device dialog.
By default only basic TCP/ IP settings are available. Click the Advanced Settings button to expand the dialog to include advanced properties.
Select the Automatic radio button when the TCP/ IP settings are obtained from a DHCP server or BOOTP server node. In automatic mode the TCP/ IP settings for the system are configured when the system services are started. The DHCP or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP/ IP information each time the system is started, there is no need to configure any other settings. Use the drop-list to select DHCP or BOOTP according to your system.
Select the Manual radio button when you do not use DHCP or BOOTP for TCP/ IP configuration. In the IP address field enter the TCP/ IP address of the host. In the Netmask field enter the subnetwork address.
When checked this option will cause the system to initialize this network interface while the system is booting. If you do not want the device initialized leave this option unchecked.
The values entered in this dialog will be displayed as the properties of the device in the device list.
Make certain that the IP-address entered is not already in use on the network. Entering an IP-address that is already on the network will result in a TCP/ IP conflict. Use ping from & konsole; to check if the address you want to enter is in use or not. If you are not sure how to complete this dialog, consult your network administrator.
Network devices may be enabled or disabled depending on system requirements. To enable a disabled network device select the device from the list then click Enable Interface.
Network devices may be enabled or disabled depending on system requirements. To disable an enabled network device select the device from the list then click Disable Interface.
This specifies the IP address of the host on the local subnetwork that provides the physical connection to remote networks, and is used by default when TCP/ IP needs to communicate with computers on other subnetworks.
If your computer offers more than one network interface, select the interface connected to network on which the gateway computer resides.
A computer running DNS matches up a fully qualified domain with a proper IP address. This is necessary because computers only understand the IP addresses. When a computer requests http: / /www. somedomain. com the DNS resolves this name to an IP-address such as 123.45.678.90.
The Domain Name Servers part of the Domain Name System tab enables easy management of the list. Server properties can be added, removed and edited. DNS records can be arranged in order of preference by selecting a record and promoting or demoting the record in the list using the Move Up or Move Down buttons as required.
From the Domain Name Servers group click the Add... button. The Add New DNS Server dialog is displayed.
Enter the IP-address of the DNS server then click Add. The record is added to the DNS list.
From the Domain Name Servers group select a DNS record then click the Edit... button. The Edit Server dialog is displayed.
The Static Hosts list describes a number of hostname-to-address mappings for the TCP/ IP subsystem. It is mostly used at boot time, when no name servers are running. On small, closed network systems, it can be used instead of Domain Name Servers.
By default, the Static Hosts list contains some records describing the & apos; localhostapos; and a handful of special records for hosts that support IPv6. This still-experimental version of IP is destined to replace version 4.
Enter the IP-address of the known host then click Add.... The Add New Alias dialog is displayed.
Enter the name of the known host then click the Add button. If the known host has multiple aliases click the Add button again and enter another alias.
Select a static host record from the list, then click the Edit... button. The Edit Static Host dialog is displayed.
Perform any of the following tasks, then click OK to update the Static Hosts list.
Changes made via the Network Settings module are not automatically applied to the system environment. To apply the changes made, start & konsole; and execute the following command.
knetwork-conf's home page is at http: / /knetworkconf. sourceforge. net where you at least can download source packages.
When using the binary distributions (most often rpm packages), it is enough to have the & kde; and QT binaries installed.
Installing binaries is recommended for less experienced users. Simply download the rpm packages. Install them from & konsole; using RPM as follows:
Alternatively, use a graphical front end like kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.
In this case, it is not enough to have the binaries of QT and & kde; installed; you also need the development packages which include libraries and other stuff.
Recommended for advanced users only. Otherwise, compiling & knetworkconf; is not difficult. The following commands should do it.
In the first section of this chapter, you'll find some valuable information about networking basics. In the second, all configuration files on your disk which can be changed by & knetworkconf; will be discussed.
This section cannot be a replacement for further lecture of IP-Networking. In this appendix, you'll only find the basic information to get you started integrating your machine into a small (home) network.
Currently, IP-networking is done using TCP/ IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been used much. IPv6 is expected to get spread in the near future. So, this manual is based on the currently most spread IPv4.
One of the most important information for setting up an interface is the IP-address which you have to assign to the interface. In foreign networks, & eg; your office, you have to ask the network administrator to tell you a valid IP-address, or you can use DHCP if this is available. In any case, you are not allowed to simply choose any IP-address!
If you want to set up a small (home) network of your own, you should use IP-addresses from a range which has especially reserved for this purpose to prevent IP-address-conflicts with the global (Internet) network. The addresses from the table shown below are not routed in the Internet, so it is safe to use them as you like.
Of course these machines can later be configured for Internet access by using a gateway machine.
For smaller networks, the most often used addresses are these in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. This is enough for networks up to over 250 computers.
Furthermore, the netmask is most often set to 255.255.255.0, so that all of these machines are members of the same subnet.
Some addresses are reserved for special things, & eg; 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1. The first one is the so called default route, the second the loopback address. The default route is needed by IP routing.
The network 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP-traffic which works on the local machine only. Usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a special device, the so called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.
In this section you'll find the configuration files which are touched by & knetworkconf; and where they reside in the file system of the different distributions.
This file is sometimes dynamically changed by DSL-connections, so do not wonder if the file does n't contain what you have put there when a DSL connection is established.
On & SuSE; it is known that this file gets occasionally resorted by the script SuSEconfig. So do not wonder if you do not find in a state you have expected.

& kcron; is an application for scheduling programs to run in the background. It is a graphical user interface to cron, the & UNIX; system scheduler.
When & kcron; starts you will see a summarized view of existing scheduled tasks and associated environment variables. If you are running as the root user, you will see these items for all users on the computer as well as the system scheduled tasks. Each of the folders can be expanded and contracted.
If a task has been disabled, no program file and parameters will appear, and the description will be disabled.
Environment variables appearing here will override any existing environment variable for all scheduled tasks. If an environment variable has been disabled, no value will appear and the description will be disabled.
To create a new scheduled task, first select the Tasks folder. Then select Edit New.... Alternatively, you can use the right mouse button menu and choose New..., or simply press Ctrl; N.
Enter the name of the program. You can specify either a relative path or absolute path. If you want to look up the program, click Browse....
Select the minute at which the task is to be scheduled. & kcron; does not support scheduling tasks at smaller than five minute intervals.
If you select both days of the month, and days of the week, the task will run when either condition is met. For instance, if you select the 1st and 15th, and select Sunday, the program will be run every 1st and 15th of the selected months (regardless of day of week) as well as every Sunday of the selected months (regardless of day of the month).
As with creating new tasks, changes to tasks will not actually be made until the crontab is saved.
To cut a scheduled task, first select the task to be cut. Then select Edit Cut.
Alternatively, you can use the right mouse button menu and choose Cut, or simply press Ctrl; X.
To copy a scheduled task, first select the task to be copied. Then select Edit Copy.
Alternatively, you can use the right mouse button menu and choose Copy, or simply press Ctrl; C.

& kdat; is a tar-based tape archiver. It is designed to work with multiple archives on a single tape. & kdat; was inspired by two separate goals. The first, was to provide a nice, & GUI; front-end to tar that supported the fast selective extraction features of the dds2tar program. The second goal was to answer my wife's question, How much longer is it going to be backing up?!?
Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat;. There are three ways to mount a tape:
& kdat; will rewind the tape, and read the header information from the tape. If & kdat; does not recognize the header on the tape, you will be prompted to format the tape.
If & kdat; recognizes the header it will look for the corresponding tape index on your local disk. If the tape index cannot be found you will be prompted to recreate the index from tape.
If all goes well, the tape drive icon will change to indicate that the tape has been mounted, and a message will appear in the status bar. The contents of the tape can be explored under the tape drive tree node.
Before ejecting a tape, you must unmount the tape. There are three ways to unmount the tape:
& kdat; will acknowledge that the tape has been unmounted by changing the tape drive icon, and displaying a message in the status bar. The tape may now be safely ejected.
Before a tape can be used by & kdat;, it must be formatted by & kdat;.
Some types of tapes must be formatted before they can be used to store data. This is not what & kdat; does when formatting a tape. If your tape drive requires that the tapes be formatted before using them, then they must be formatted before they can be formatted by & kdat;. Typically floppy tape drives require that their media be formatted, but DAT drives do not.
After entering the tape name and capacity, & kdat; will proceed to format the tape. ALL DATA ON THE TAPE WILL BE LOST. Once & kdat; has finished formatting the tape, the tape will be automatically mounted and is ready for use.
Before initiating a backup, you must select some files to archive. There are three ways to select files for backup:
Highlight a file or folder in the local file tree. Only the selected file or subfolder will be archived.
Highlight a backup profile in the tree. Only the files in the backup profile will be archived.
Checkmark selected files in the local file tree. Only the checked files and/ or subfolders will be archived.
& RMB; click on a file or folder in the local file tree, and select Backup....
Once the backup has been initiated, the Backup Options dialog will appear. This dialog gives you a chance to review the selected files, and change the backup options.
After accepting the backup options, the Backup dialog will appear. This dialog shows the progress of the backup including throughput and time remaining.
Highlight a file or folder in one of the archives under the tape drive tree node. Only the selected file or subfolder will be verified.
Checkmark selected files in one of the archives under the tape drive tree node. Only the checked files and/ or subfolders will be verified.
& RMB; click on a file or folder in one of the archives, and select Verify....
Once the verify has been initiated, the Verify Options dialog will appear. This dialog gives you a chance to review the selected files, and change the working folder for the verification.
After accepting the verify options, the Verify dialog will appear. This dialog shows the progress of the verification including throughput and time remaining.
Before initiating a restore, you must select some files to restore. There are two ways to select files for restoring:
Highlight a file or folder in one of the archives under the tape drive tree node. Only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.
Checkmark selected files in one of the archives under the tape drive tree node. Only the checked files and/ or subfolders will be restored.
& RMB; click on a file or folder in one of the archives, and select Restore....
Once the restore has been initiated, the Restore Options dialog will appear. This dialog gives you a chance to review the selected files, and change the working folder for the restore.
After accepting the restore options, the Restore dialog will appear. This dialog shows the progress of the restore including throughput and time remaining.
Sometimes it may be necessary to recreate the tape index file from the tape contents. This process will overwrite any existing index file for the tape. There are two way to recreate an index from tape:
This should create a new backup profile using the currently checked files and the default backup options. The following options can be set for the backup profile:
The current working folder to perform the backup in. The list of files to backup is automatically updated to reflect the selected working folder.
For each folder that is listed under Backup files, only the files under that folder that are on the same file system as the folder will be archived. Folders on different filesystems can be listed under Backup files, and each will be treated independently of the others, by tar.
Perform an incremental backup. A snapshot file is used to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup. Only the files that have changed will be archived.
The name of the file that is used to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup.
Remove the snapshot file before invoking tar. This has the effect of backing up all of the files, and creating the snapshot file for use next time.
The Files & gt; gt; and lt; lt; Files buttons were not fully implemented at the time this documentation was written...
User preferences can be configured by selecting Preferences... from the Edit menu. The following preferences can be configured:
The full path to your tape device (usually / dev/ tape). This path must point to the non-rewind version of your tape device.
If enabled, before trying to mount a tape & kdat; will issue an mt load command to the tape drive. Some drives may require this before reading and writing the tape.
If enabled, whenever a tape is mounted by & kdat;, the tape drive will be asked to disable the eject button. This option may not work with all tape drives.
If enabled, whenever a tape is unmounted by & kdat;, the tape will automatically be ejected from the drive. Do not use this option with floppy tape drives.
If enabled, & kdat; will attempt to change the hardware block size used by the tape drive. Not all drives support variable block size. Whether this feature is enabled or not, you must tell & kdat; the block size that your tape drive uses (ie; 10240 for ftape users).
When & kdat; formats a tape it writes a single file at the beginning of the tape. This file should only occupy a single tape block. The contents of the file are:
(n bytes) The tape ID string. The format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the machine that the tape was formatted on and seconds is the number of seconds since the epoch when the tape was formatted.
The tape ID is used to locate a file, with the same name, in the $HOME /. kdat folder.
Each of the remaining files on the tape are plain-old tar archives. You should be able to manipulate them directly with & GNU; tar. Even non-GNU; tar should work for non-incremental backups.
Verify the contents of a backup tape. This item is unavailable unless a tape is mounted.
& ksystemlog; is a system log viewer tool for & kde;. This program is developed for beginner users who do n't know how to find information about their system or where the log files are located. It is also designed for advanced users who want to quickly see problems occuring on their server.
& ksystemlog; helps users understand what their machine does in the background. & ksystemlog; aims to simplify the reading of system log files. This program is developed for beginner users who do n't know how to find information about their system or where the log files are located in their computer.
But it is also designed for advanced users who want to quickly see problems occuring on their server. & ksystemlog; tries to provide some advanced features to allow sorting and reading logs from specifical programs.
In its current version, & ksystemlog; 0.4.1 has quite a number of helpful features, such as:
Support for many different log files type, with the support of Syslog server formating, Samba
Many other features are included and will be discussed in the appropriate chapters of this manual.
As you will see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; provides features to easily sort and filter log lines. We are now going to describe them in the next parts of this documentation.
When you start & ksystemlog;, it tries to open the most useful log, the System Log. If it does not display it and pops up a message box, you probably forgot to launch & ksystemlog; as an administrator user (commonly named root). The log files are usually available in the / var/ log folder, which is often protected against normal users.
You can also use the filter bar to filter according to the selected criteria and the typed string. Simply type something in the filter, and the list will automatically be modified to only display lines which match your filter string. By default, the combo box next to the filter selects All, which means that a line will be displayed only if one of its columns contains the filter string.
You can select another field to filter only this column of the list. For example, in the System Log, by selecting the Process column, and writing its name in the filter bar, & ksystemlog; will display every log lines sent by this process.
This option is activated by default and helps you see which lines have a higher level than the others. For example, Error level will be highlighted in a different color than the Notice one. This feature can be disabled in the configuration dialog.
If you are only interested in a specific process (for example in the System Log or the Cron Log), you can hide its PID in the Process column. This can be useful if you are trying to analyze the output of a specific command, like a Samba server. In this case, please use the Filter Bar.
Furthermore, to focus on the newly appeared log lines, you can toggle the Scroll to New Lines option.
& ksystemlog; allows you to open several log modes by opening multiple tabs. For this, simply use the Window menu to manage and open new tabs. Once you have selected the right tab, simply choose the desired log mode using the dedicated menu.
& ksystemlog; has its own home page http: / /ksystemlog. forum-software. org. Please refer to the instructions on the home page since they will contain up-to-date information about how to obtain & ksystemlog;.
& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion Repository: ksystemlog; in the & kde; repository
Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, commonly known (and hereafter referenced) as & ksysv;. This section introduces a few concepts and explains what you can do with & ksysv;.
System V init is fast becoming the standard in the & Linux; world to control the startup of software at boot time. This is because it is arguably easier to use and more powerful and flexible than the traditional BSD init.
I wo n't go into the history here (mainly because I do n't know it: -).
The init binary is located in / sbin and not / etc. This is important as one might try and upgrade a machine to System V init without re-installing and reformatting. The & Linux; kernel looks in / etc for its init first, so you must make sure and delete your old init from there if any.
SysV init also differs from BSD init in that the config files are in a subfolder of / etc instead of residing directly in / etc. This folder is called rc. d. In there you will find rc. sysinit and the following folders:
init. d contains a bunch of scripts. Basically, you need one script for each service you may need to start at boot time or when entering another runlevel. Services include things like networking, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd, & etc;. Services do not include things like setserial that must only be run once and then exited. Things like that should go in the file rc. local.
rc. local should be in / etc/ rc. d if you want one. Most systems include one even though it does n't do much. You can also include an rc. serial in / etc/ rc. d if you need to do serial port specific things at boot time.
The kernel looks in several places for init and runs the first one it finds.
The default runlevel is decided in / etc/ inittab. You should have a line close to the top like:
From this, you'd look in the second column and see that the default runlevel is 3, as should be the case for most systems. If you want to change it, you can edit / etc/ inittab by hand and change the 3. Be very careful when you are messing with the inittab. If you do mess up, you can get in to fix it by rebooting and doing:
Now, how does it run all the right scripts? If you do an ls -l on rc3. d, you might see something like:
What you'll notice is that there are no real files in the folder. Everything there is a link to one of the scripts in the init. d folder.
How does it start and stop services? Simple. Each of the scripts is written to accept an argument which can be start and stop. You can execute those scripts by hand in fact with a command like:
To stop the httpd server. Init just reads the name and if it has a K, it calls the script with the stop argument. If it has an S it calls the script with a start argument.
Some people want an easy way to setup machines to be multi-purpose. I could have a server runlevel that just runs httpd, & Sendmail;, networking, & etc; Then I could have a user runlevel that runs & kdm;, networking, & etc;
Here you learn how to use & ksysv;, which should n't be hard since it was designed to be as user-friendly as possible.
Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy: just drag an entry from the Available Services area onto one of the six runlevels to start (or resp. stop) it in that runlevel.
You can also move scripts between runlevels, or change the position in a given runlevel, by dragging it around. Doing so removes the entry from its original runlevel (or position). This does n't happen when you drag an entry from the Available Services area.
Entries are moved when you drag them to a new area. To copy a service to a different runlevel, you have to select Copy from the Edit or context menu and Paste it in the target runlevel.
The sorting number of an entry sometimes cannot be calculated. In such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of surrounding entries before re-trying to insert the service.
Currently there is no way to recover items dragged onto the Trash Can, so be careful!
You can use the Tab key to switch focus between different panels (Available Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop, & etc;) and the cursor keys to move the selection up and down.
To move an entry to a different runlevel, Cut it to the clipboard (using Ctrl; X and Paste it in the target runlevel (with Ctrl; V).
To manually change an entries sorting number or name, press Enter to open the properties dialog. Use the Tab key to switch between different fields. Close the dialog by pressing Enter to accept the modifications, or press Esc to cancel any changes.
Because of the danger of data loss, all menu entries under File ask for confirmation before doing their work.
All options are saved in $KDEHOME / share/ config/ ksysvrc. Defaults are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share/ config/ ksysvrc), if available, or else generated within & ksysv;. Changes to the defaults are stored in your local ksysvrc.
I played around with the default runlevel, and now my machine reboots all the time. What can I do?
Enter linux single at the LILO prompt, and press Enter to boot into single user mode. Edit the file / etc/ inittab and change to the default runlevel to something sane. 3 should normally be safe.
I scheduled some services to be run in runlevel X using & ksysv;, so why are n't they working?
If you're using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) distributions, you also have to edit a distribution specific file in / etc. Please have a look at the manual of your distribution for details.
The approach to starting services used by the above mentioned distributions makes configuration of services easy for the proprietary configuration tools these distributions provide, but it is unfortunately non-standard. The & ksysv; authors plan to write a generic extension for this approach some time in the future, but do n't hold your breath.
If you're using a different distribution, please check you have all the config files needed by the service, and whether they are in the correct locations. Some daemons for example Apache, (aka httpd) just die silently if their configuration files are missing or misconfigured.
These vary by distribution, so this is an incomplete list of the most common & Linux; distributions. If you have additional distributions, please email the author and have the information added to this manual.
This documentation describes & kuser; version 1.0. This program allows you to manage users and groups on your system.
Actually, you do not need to do anything to begin using & kuser; except configuration.
When you have made the changes you want, you must Save them for them to take effect. Either choose the Toolbar icon, or use the File menu.
& kuser; is a very simple application. In the main window you can see two tabs: the list of users and the list of groups. To edit a user or a group, just double click on it. The user or group properties dialog will appear.
The number of tabs depends on the type of the user storage system and whether quotas are being used. Additional tabs will appear if you have shadow passwords, or any other similar things such as / etc/ master. passwd in BSD flavor Unices.
The Password Management tab will appear if you have shadow passwords, or any other similar things such as / etc/ master. passwd in BSD flavor Unices.
You will probably see the Quota tab only if you have at least one mounted volume with quota enabled and a quota file present. There you may modify all quota related parameters:
All these parameters can be changed for each file system that has user quota enabled. File systems can be changed using the Quota Filesystem box.
The Groups tab contains all the information about the selected user's participation in groups. The primary group to which the user belongs is set in the Primary Group box. The user can be assigned to additional groups by checking them in the large box.
The Group Properties dialog contains a list of all users. Check the boxes for each user to be assigned to the selected group.
To add a user or group to the system, either choose Add from the User or Group menu, or click the relevant Add button on the toolbar. The selected user or group can also be edited or deleted in the same way.
Using this module, you can install lilo boot manager, add/ remove/ change boot password, change time till booting default OS, add/ remove/ change default OS, add/ remove/ change OS's, and more!
