on request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations take place on issues that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be reviewed by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes arising from a statement of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or a measure taken by the Council , disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators at the request of a party .
the Community and the States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named shall elect a fifth arbitr@@ ator .
if the Community and the States or the Organisation have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the motion to an arbit@@ ration request , the Community or the Organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure is applicable if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of nam@@ ing or nom@@ in@@ ating the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be approved and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organization , the Community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention shall come into force for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its proceedings are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
II ) When the organization noti@@ fies the organization that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the Community and the States consult each other in the request of one of the contracting parties about a change in this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states .
C ) The General Director shall immediately notify all Member States of the Organization of any amend@@ ment of this Convention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement constitutes the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of part I of the provisions of part I .
the aim of the safety measures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear waste from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear fis@@ sur@@ es for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ r@@ ence of such a tur@@ no@@ ff by risk of early discovery .
in order to obtain the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of basic importance , composite with the spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the audit by the organization is carried out by means of an explanation in which the quantity of material which is not proven for a certain period of time , under specification of accuracy limits for the indicated me@@ gen is specified .
in carrying out their audit , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , if necessary , fores@@ ee how they are near@@ er to the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measurement system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , delayed , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for the determination , examination and evaluation of differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) method for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured assets and non @-@ measured losses ;
( F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which points to the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Procedure for reporting to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) If original ( or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described by letter c ) , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear uses ;
C ) leaves the core material suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ulation , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other material , produced in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle , is introduced into the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this agreement are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues , so the organisation and the community shall consult each other through the application of appropriate safegu@@ ards .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , insofar as the organisation and the Community shall establish that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organization exemp@@ ts the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Core material when used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
on request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this agreement , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire amount of nuclear material liber@@ ated by this article is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special foldable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if free core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are made on that material .
the Community is meeting with the organization of supplementary agreements that are required in the scope which is required for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organization under this Convention , in the individual , as to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without changing the agreement between the organization and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supplementary agreements come into force at the same time as possible , or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the organisation constitutes a summari@@ zed inventory of the whole , the securing measures of this agreement underlying nuclear material in the states , not@@ withstanding its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory list as a result of the following reports and the results of their audit .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other
the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation ( GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by universal suff@@ ocation problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution is bound by the Member States within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the allocation of funds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the Organisation of the EW@@ G has presented a table which is inten@@ tional in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; special transaction account &quot; which the Member States contribute in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; by the organization ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; administrators &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the member state , which must be paid on demand in the currency of the relevant state to the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the outlet of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment takes place in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the ste@@ ward agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may be able to make payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the Administrator obli@@ ges approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the Notes to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
by granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the EEC conditions :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its additional credit capacity to loan conditions without discount ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices applied to the development loans taken out of ordinary funds provided by the organization , which is to be taken into account under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ord@@ n@@ ance means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the loans granted by the organization ; thus , in ten years they are re@@ payable in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this clock are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves .
each transaction loan is to be interpreted by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is given in particular .
the proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or made in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special transaction at the time of loan granted .
cash payments from special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a Mem@@ ber@@ nation is to be rejected as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker holds the EEC on the purposes and programmes approved by the directors for the purpose of audi@@ ting all transactions in preparation for the audi@@ ting by the directors .
during the period of payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator reports the EEC as a quar@@ terly basis on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made there@@ to .
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account conclusion .
following full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EW@@ G transm@@ its as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the payments received from the account and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely to achieve the objectives of the agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrators up to the full issue of the means of the special interaction account , carry out an exchange of ideas about the status of the special interaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and about all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be due with immediate effect .
if the total amount of the money paid by the recipient is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement is effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the stated noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter of letter to change the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded , HA@@ T has issued the following VER@@ OR@@ D@@ N@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation are referred to as Joint Company J@@ ET - herein@@ after called &quot; J@@ ET &quot; - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot;
for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is very familiar with the area concerned .
since up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research , which has achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement should enable each contracting party to take advantage of unnecessary overl@@ aps through a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and accordingly the common goal of this research work , i.@@ e . the cost @-@ less competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction is to be achieved more quickly .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties are associ@@ ating their respective research programmes defined in App@@ endi@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss program will take over long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or altered after examination by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Agreement so that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this shall take place in the place of the programme listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association planned in paragraph 1 is realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among the concerned laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries with whom Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom program ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
within the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association agreement stipulated in Article 2 , clause 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the states and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ate Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program .
with the same objective , Eur@@ atom ensures that Switzerland is involved with the time of entering into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel exchanges . &quot;
with regard to J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s Joint Company , which accepts its Articles of Association .
Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland &apos;s contractual partner can become a contract partner whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with the implementation of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Number 1 of the present Agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and the Association Agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , includes the implementation of a steering committee , the competent representatives of the Commission and the Council of the Federation .
- to monitor the development of research and to ste@@ er the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group established as part of the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after called &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , who has ensured the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning current or planned programmes and activities in the Eur@@ atom program , is responsible for all research and development activities that this agreement relates .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the associated organs and alig@@ ns its T * with the common objective stated in the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme , as well as the common objective stated in Article 1 of the present Agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are du@@ ly considered .
according to its Rules of Procedure , the VG nom@@ in@@ ates one or several Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the scope of the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are requested .
the consulting groups , which the VG research proposals suggest that the means granted for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom program .
the Committee &apos;s Committee to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for making optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories performing at the work carried out within the programme will perform this task with regard to all research and development activities that fall under the present agreement .

the coordination committees , which provide appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the resources , personnel and knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , shall apply this task in the respective area with respect to all research and development work that falls under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F is responsible for the core and energy research of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country .
at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F disc@@ usses the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of future programmes and the definition of its overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion .
the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have an advisory character .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statement on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of HR inter@@ change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the work of all technical advisory boards or all administrative bodies that are created for the purpose of the present agreement .
the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom program according to this agreement is annually fixed to an amount attributed to Eur@@ atom &apos;s contribution to the costs of the Eur@@ atom program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Common Market as soon as it is established .
moreover , the Swiss company J@@ ET re@@ jects an amount according to the rules of the constitution of this Joint Company .
the financial contribution of Eur@@ atom to finance work within the association agreement and the agreement on human resources exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used for the calculation of Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the relevant contracts .
the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with which amount will be allocated to cover the expenditure within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program for the year .
the Federal Council will pay the commission to the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .

I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community regarding these changes and suggest you as an appointment for entry into force on 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would like to confirm the consent of your government to the above .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of the Member States &apos; demands in the framework of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future supply funds of the member countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some conditions are already mentioned below , which the BI@@ S would be willing to use . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with each Stand@@ by Credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without having to be crossed for a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit audit commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of one month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by Agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the conc@@ essions would take place in the currencies available to the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be dealt with considering the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applied at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S must be able to obtain the required funds on the market itself , the interest rate applied to the application could reach a maximum , which corresponds to the corresponding margin of the Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

within the framework of this agreement , the possibilities for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount according to the Community :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the traditional forms of supply ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community uses the protective clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market regulated in this agreement is not affected .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community is obliged to limit the exhaus@@ tion to the imports of products covered by this agreement to a ho@@ of rate of 10 b.@@ H .
in the case of accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay adju@@ sts the quantity set under number 2 in accordance with the extent of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import capacity for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account in accordance with the above @-@ mentioned bar@@ code of exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount mentioned under number 2 is determined by the days of the accession of Greece to the community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ asses .
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid market developments that could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the Community market within the agreed amounts .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance specified on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) ha@@ mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated excluding the volume of blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ists , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter yields the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic particle @-@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which the International standard preparations are present ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the international standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ irs contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative Tit@@ ration of the International Standard Against A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; Anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents indicated on the label is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the prerequisites for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ ent or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , regardless of whether in liquid form or after dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents required for the international exchange of blood groups should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an International Convention on a uniform system has been established .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a tank is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a tank must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the Manufac@@ turers &apos; Laboratory has written records on all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
adequate samples of all ej@@ ected re@@ agents must be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent an effective portion ; others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
on each container , a black printed label is available in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re @-@ dissolution ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions provided to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may be subject to change when international standard preparations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .

in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the in@@ convenience in goods traffic between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; for this purpose , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as single paper ) is introduced , which is to be used for all export and import procedures , as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as the shipping method ) between the contracting parties .
the in@@ conveni@@ ences associated with the goods transport between the contractual parties are authorised by means of a single document to use for the im@@ prints according to the patterns in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention .
the single paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping or import .
- expressly requested for the implementation of legal regulations in a contracting party whose application would not be guaranteed with the sole use of the single @-@ paper ;
- to be demanded by the participants , so that they may come to the enjoyment of an advantage or a certain relief .
( 1 ) This Agreement does not hin@@ der the Parties to apply simplified procedures , even using data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation of the parties involved .
( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied proceedings may in particular fores@@ ee that the goods concerned shall not be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be admitted .

- allow the competent authorities to request the data required for the provision of the relevant provisions into their data processing systems for the treatment of the registration , and , if necessary , without giving a written notification ;
- allow the competent authorities to see in case of use of a data processing system for the treatment of the applications , that the export , dispatch or import message is either created by the single document created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant ;
- to apply facil@@ itation adopted by the Committee in the way of a resolution pursuant to Article 11 ( 3 ) .
( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the necessary precau@@ tions in the export , shipping and import of goods are laid down in Annex II to this Convention .
( 2 ) The common codes that are to be used in the pre @-@ print listed in App@@ endi@@ x I shall be found in Annex III to this Convention .

( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective con@@ sign@@ ments , however , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the regulations for export and shipping are based on one and the same pre @-@ print by means of the copies envis@@ aged for these ram@@ parts .
in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities shall be convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the en@@ rol@@ ment in the individual proced@@ ural sections must coinci@@ de .
( 1 ) To ensure a smooth flow of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries place each other on request or - insofar as they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from itself out of all available information ( including administrative reports )
( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or denied in whole or in part , if the sought @-@ out country of the opinion is that the minist@@ erial assistance would imp@@ air his security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate an operating , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y .
( 3 ) In the case of refusal or rejection of the minist@@ erial assistance , the appropriate decision and its reason@@ ing must not be communicated to the seeking country .
( 4 ) En@@ sur@@ es the customs authority of a country for administrative assistance , which she herself could not afford , if she were asked to do so , she points out in her search for this circum@@ stance .
( 5 ) The information obtained by paragraph 1 may only be used for the purposes of this Convention and shall enjoy the protection that the national law of the country that it has received shall be granted for information of this kind .
