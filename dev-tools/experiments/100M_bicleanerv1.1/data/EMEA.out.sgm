<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Provision Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wiry thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a psychological condition whereby the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to treat manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to take or the melting tablets can be applied to patients causing difficulty swallowing.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines that are taken at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole works primarily as a" "" "partial agony" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent as the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Aripiprazole is helping to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of the symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that were suffering from increased anxiety over a period of two hours compared to a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection Solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased unrest, compared with the response of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined by means of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients referring to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb (records).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg were significantly reduced in the symptoms of increased anxiety than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Furthermore, up to 74 weeks of efficacy, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), acute (drowsiness), nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of abilify in treating schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee found that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, when oral therapy is not suitable to weigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the transport of Abilify to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a replacement of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no higher suicide risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be applied with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celierated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical trials that lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify show signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients treated with Aripiprazole an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydips, polyurie, polyphagistry and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteasant inhibitors, may have similar effects and similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 are administered together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextrometmorphological / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextrometmorphorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data storage for humans and because of the concerns raised in the reproductive studies of the animal, unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - A controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients treated with Aripiprazole treatment and 13,1% for patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from aperiapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not show any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally transitory and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence after treatment with Aripiprazole, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information on the efficacy of hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and on the putt.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenia patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents who received a response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a lanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value in significantly fewer patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy superior to placebo in the reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Moreover, in week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of Mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which in part had not responded to lithium or valproat monotherapy at therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed an superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period of 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before Randomisation, Aripiprazl showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a reversal into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylic regulation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylamation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshalbwerage is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and about 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in patients with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data showed no particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans, so that they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-kidney cancer and combined adrenal-kidney-adenomas / carcinoma in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates from Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole do not exceed 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that lead to expositions of 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the features of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution to take.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no tests on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with aggregation and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of the bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, the patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be applied with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celierated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>

<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In comparison with CYP2D6 'poor' (poor ') metabolites, the common application of CYP2D6 can result in high effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and similar can reductions should be made.</seg>

<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not show any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (Creatinphosphokinase), generally transitory and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence after treatment with Aripiprazole, include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder and aggregation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms with regard to the detachment and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference Low.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5,8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggregation, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenia patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents who received a response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-DepressionsRates, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazoll (oral) significantly reduced the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In a lanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' occurred, significantly fewer patients reported a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, which in part had not responded to lithium or valproat monotherapy at therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed an superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before Randomisation, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a reversal into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazole is 90% larger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy test subjects, the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after use.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), the 15- and 5 times over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity following intravenous application there was no safety-relevant concern after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data showed no particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans, so that they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-kidney cancer and combined adrenal-kidney-adenomas / carcinoma in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10-fold of the mean regular-state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates from Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean regular-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 81 times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole application or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared with 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsening the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments from their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low levels of neutrophils before the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that in contrast to other medicines containing paclitaxel it would not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the marketing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the lack of first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not shown (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">For sensory neuropathy Level 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticles formulated by Paclitaxel, which could have much other pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no recurrent abrasion cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils have risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocytes increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l again.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a cardiotoxicity was not proven unambiguously with Abraxane, cardiac relapses in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patients after the application of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual antiemetics and constipients.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied in pregnant women or in childbearing age, which do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to leave no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a spermaceration, because the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very frequent) and dizziness (frequent), which can affect the traffic density and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated at the pivotal phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of the patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 lists the side effects associated with the gift of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, elevated levels of creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dyspaggia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, sores in the lower abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, muscle spasms, skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules substance that promotes the merging of microtubules from the tubula and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin imparts the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the course of in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transenic transfer is mediated by the gp-60 albuminous receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the tumor is occurring due to the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unfaded trials and 454 patients treated in a randomized phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer in 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a paclitaxel monotherapy every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic disease and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for general response rate and time to disease progression as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathic grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound at baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substance (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or crossover network of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the removal of Abraxane (43%) as a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine secretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the Metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarised medicine and, as in other potentially toxic substances, be careful when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe we are slowly injected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution into a bottle of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="327">After the complete addition of the solution, the glass bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle should be swivelled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes until a complete discharge of the powder is done.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood cancers that could occur in connection with blood transfusion complications, if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who wish to make a blood donation, Abseamed must be injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no lack of iron, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietin deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that empowers them to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">As an injection into a vein, Abseamed was compared with the reference medical drug as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected with Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between weeks 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study where the effects of abseamed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abseamed were maintained to the same extent as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Streamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the requirements of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which produces Abseamed, will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>

<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex, and overall disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can be observed via or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose which is required for the control of anemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose: 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using the intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia symptoms and - follow-up may vary depending on age, sex and total disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose which is required for monitoring anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocytes by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocytes, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticulozyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of hemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulosis number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulosis number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the initial storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required, abseamed should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the scout therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythropoetin at erythroblastopenie (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive an abseamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastopenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolilies).</seg>
<seg id="409">The application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who cannot take part in an autologous donor program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the otid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulozytente should be determined and the usual causes of non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminumtoxicity, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the reticuloyte "index"), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocytes and leukocyte numbers should be determined and if no other reason of an effective loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow is considered to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the administration of epoetin if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency which is not yet dialysis, will not accelerate progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa dosage and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the treatment efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2, to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment under the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients intended for larger elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated if possible prior to the beginning of the epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Furthermore, treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of postoperative endothrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporine, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose can be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Acupa was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with risedronate for six months (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of the alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis treatments) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis treatments) with those of placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Accredited had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Acupa occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Accura must not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions at the infusion and osteonnecrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Acupa manufacturer provides clarification material for doctors prescribing Accura for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains clues how to apply the medicine, as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous 5 mg acetone infusion is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture the administration of the infusion of acetone is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget Morbus, Accura should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget disease.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Paget Morbus with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient supply of calcium for patients with Morbus Paget, twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Actilla (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Acupa infusion.</seg>

<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see section 4.4) Patients with a creatinin-clearance &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended as limited clinical experience for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Acupa are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, since data on safety and efficacy are absent.</seg>
<seg id="599">Acupa is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalcemia is to be treated with Aclasta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">A temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalcemia may develop because of the quick release of the effects of Zoledron acid on bone structure, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclaa (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient supply of calcium for patients with Morbus Paget, twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zoledronic acid was associated with renal dysfunction, which was associated as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. increasing the serum creatinine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creation of the creatinin-Clearance (measured every year before administration) and the occurrence of renal failure and impaired renal function in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years were comparable to the placebo group and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Accredited to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), occurred at 2.3% of patients treated with aclaa in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with aclaa in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the study to avoid clinical fractures after fracture fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Acupa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of citric acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been knowingly, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteonnecrosis in the maxillofacial region in one patient with aclaa and a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of an overdose leading to clinically relevant hypokalcemia, calcium and / or intravenous calcium gluconate infusion can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) -T score for the leg neck ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric head fractures Actilla decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclaa-treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of 60% for eddy fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures Accura showed a consistent effect over three years, resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on the bone density (BMD) Aclasta raised the bone density at the lumbar fluoric acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.1%, the stem-neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 post-menopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclaa (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvis.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison to placebo, a microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone mass and the preservation of trabecular marrow architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5-mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Accredited, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Accredited Treatment increased the BMD at all times compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">The treatment carried out over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% on the total thigh and 4.3% on the thigh.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in response to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (study CZOL446M2308), the once yearly administration of acetone compared to the once weekly administration of Alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar-vertebrae-BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Accura was studied in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderate severe Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of the alkaline phosphatase according to 2.6x to 3.0x age-specific upper normal value when taken into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of citric acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for aclaa and risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month trial (referred to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 patients with Aclasta and 107 patients treated with risedronate patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with risedronate could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, plasma levels rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biologic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life times t ½ -0.24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eliminationshalbsis time t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early phases of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption into the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in urine, while the rest is mainly boned to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolized by cytochromium-P450 enzymes is unlikely because zinc acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the Zoledron acid correlated with the creatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine-Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 patients examined.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function disorder until a creatinate-Clearance down to 35 mL / min requires no dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe renal dysfunction (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) is only limited data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-Latvian intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg of body weight in mice.</seg>
<seg id="657">In the case of studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC) have been administered threefold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application the renal compatibility of Zoledron Acid was determined in rats using doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dosage corresponding to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, equivalent).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use of accumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common occurrence of repeated use studies was a proliferation of primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding which reflects the pharmacological, anti-resortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats were observed with teratogenicity in doses ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum calcium level.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Provision Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients), in which metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), which can not be satisfactorily set with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl diurea or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonysubstance or insulin may be retained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulfonylic resin and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; in the process, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl hard material, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">The studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a lowering of the HbA1c value suggesting that blood sugar levels have been reduced to 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional dose of actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylic agent in a lowering of the HbA1c value was 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin showed a reduction of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side-effects associated with Actos were vision disorders, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for Actos in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease) to develop a decompensated heart failure, the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated liver enzymatic values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymatic values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overbelly pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymatic values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision on whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazone should continue until the clinical assessment has been conducted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which may be due to fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A slight reduction of mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocruses (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred as a result of hematelution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with insulin or as two-fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, treatment with thiazolidindia, including Pioglitazon, was reported to have a incidence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but failing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for investigating cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or if this occurs, the treatment is to be replaced (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies to investigate the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacogenesis of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hypercholinaemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the uterine, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; commonly &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the index of the lens as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT ascents over the three-fold the upper limit of the norm tend to be similar to placebo but less often than in comparison groups among metformin or sulfonyl harnants.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazon or Pioglitazon resides.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it was rarely reported about cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon, but more often when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of ProActive study, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the recorded maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ)), which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat, and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the production of glucosamine in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the start of the therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization were randomised to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive only insulin; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials for one year showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study on type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly but clinically not significantly elevated LDL- cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced overall plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while negative values were observed under metformin and Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern-triglycerides but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this both about an effect on the triglyceride level and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered spoglitazone in the plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the threefold of the efficacy of Pioglitazon whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacoDynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After the oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was mainly found in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination rate of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies appeared in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hypercholinaemia resulting from the gestation and increased insulin resistance of the uterine, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary bladder.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for investigating cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of more than two years, the effects of combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclacide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials for 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern-triglycerides but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this both about an effect on the lacyglyceride level as well as the hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study failed to target its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularisation and revitalization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone does not entail cardiovascular longterm risks.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar settings have improved significantly, for example, by intensive insulin therapy, can change the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA against insulin in animal origin) may result in a change in dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when switching to actrapane in the patient, it may be necessary at first dosing or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take account of possible interactions with the therapy and consult his patients always after other medicines taken by them.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia, however, can gradually develop: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have grape picking, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid person or by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by splitting is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular hazard to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Particularly in patients with cardiac problems in prehistory, there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side-effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already resulted in deposits (including a toxicity known from the history of the disease and / or arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum resistive level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase can be considered on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function, efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplant recipients Since there are no experiences with organ transplant recipients, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease in patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure is not recommended with Febuxostat (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnsawing medicines, acute toxicity may occur during the treatment beginning, because urinary acid deposits can first be mobilised in the tissues by lowering the serum resin acid level.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. for malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan syndrome), the absolute concentration of xanthin in the urine is so common in rare cases that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">During Phase 3 clinical studies light abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the start of the febuxostats (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas did not conduct any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to an increase in theophylline (a inhibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen were associated with an increase in Febuxostature (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active agent used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily demonstrated an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an antacid, which contains magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delays the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies cannot be ruled out on side effects of Febuxostat on the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, operating machinery or performing hazardous activities until they can reasonably be sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostats compared to the Allopurinol group in the pivotal study phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal relationship with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disorder and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), random (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects, which could be observed in the treatment arms with 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxostat and which were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with Colchicin. * * In clinical trials no severe skin rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The treatment-related events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostats treatment groups as a whole more than once and occurred in patients receiving Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to data from time to time.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in the pivotal studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypotesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, shortness of skin, skin irritation, bursitis, protein uria, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in lymphocytes, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The effective mechanism of uric acid is the end product of the purine metabolism in humans and results in the hypoxanthin reaction process → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a powerful, non-Purim-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki value for in vitro inhibitor located below the nanomolar area.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients suffering from hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in every study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum increment value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the commonly used dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum carcinoma (1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were summarized for the analyses. * p &lt; 0.001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">Lowering the serum product piegels to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained continuously throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum carcinoma &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction (i.e. H).</seg>
<seg id="1219">The primary efficacy endpoint at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) was achieved with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum levels in patients, regardless of their kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum resin acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent lowering of the serum resistivity levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in the incidence of toxicity (i.e. more than 97% of the patients needed no treatment against rheumatism).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the sperm volume size, which resulted in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the gout nodes until month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving Allopurinol (5.8%) in open longterm extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat increased by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportionately.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum levels, provided this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent Steady-state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat is from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuxostat amounts to about 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes, these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostately curonid is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found to be unchangeable Febuxostat (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair found itself as unaltered Febuxostat (12%), acetylglukuronid of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of Febuxostat increased by approximately the 1.8-fold of 7,5 m / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ, h / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (childrygh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B), the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase of urinary tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, in about 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purine metabolism and urine composition and considered non-relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In case of high doses, which were about 3 times the refractive medical exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in supporting rats with expositions, which are approximately 4.3 times and in carrying rabbits with expositions, which are approximately 13 times the human-therapeutic exposure, have no teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1251">The holder of the authorisation for placing on the market has to ensure that a pharmacovigilance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.8.1 of the application is ready before the drug is put into circulation, and as long as it is available as the medicine is brought into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="1252">According to the CHMP guidelines, an updated RMP is to be presented with the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) according to the CHMP guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1253">In addition, an update of the RMP is required • if new information is available that has an impact on the safety data, the pharmaceuvigilance plan or activities for risk minimization • within 60 days after reaching important milestones (pharmaceutical vigilance or risk minimization) • on request of the EMEA</seg>
<seg id="1254">In some people uric acid accumulates in the blood and can reach concentrations which are so high that uric acid becomes insoluble.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you keep the urinary acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the crystal formation is prevented and in this way with time a reduction of the discomfort is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC must not be taken, if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other ingredients of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine • if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem. • If you suffer from a high level of urinary acid concentration in a result of a cancer or the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare congenital disorder where too much uric acid is found in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a stroke at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, warmth and joint swelling), wait until the attack is cancelled before starting the treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be the case with everyone, but may also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months, when you take ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines to you if necessary, in order to prevent a toxicity or to treat the symptoms associated with it (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medications that contain one of the following substances, since interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may possibly consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurin (for the treatment of the immune defence) • Theophyllin (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning in heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies have been carried out on the effects of ADENURIC on the traffic density and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also provided data suggesting that the Alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), constipation, diarrhoea (swallowing), inflated abdomen (blower abdomen), as well as sour upbringing.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3, or any of the other ingredients ADROVANCE may not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be applied in case of esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of risophageal irritations and associated side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or take the tablet into the mouth, as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pylorroplasty, only be given under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as estsophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by oesophageal strokes, were reported in patients receiving alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible oesophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to stop the medicine in case of symptoms of malignant irritation such as dysphagy, pain in swallowing or retrostale pain or new or worsening heartburn (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the appearance of symptoms that indicate an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dispensing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Whereas in large-scale clinical studies with Alendronat no increased risk was observed, stomach and duodenal ulcera were rare (after market launch), including some severe and with complications (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonnecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapy region contains mainly IV bisphosphonates administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to indicate whether the replacement of bisphosphonate therapy in patients needing a jaw-surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>

<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to use ADROVANCE in the next morning while taking a dose of ADROVANCE after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but keep taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the planned week of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can impair the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">After taking Alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronate in clinical trials was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most of the reports stem from cancer patients, but it was also reported in osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1308">However, the serum levels of serum levels of up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or superimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the closely meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations</seg>

<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate aftertransplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of the graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments can later be necessary as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Prophylaxis of the graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion of Prograf to Advagraf Must a graft recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules should be converted to once daily intake of Prograf capsules, so this changeover has to take place in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After migrating from other immunosuppressants to an advocate once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the prophylaxis of the graft rejection must begin with the recommended oral initial dose in the case of kidney and liver transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">In adult patients who are converted to Advent, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplant patients, was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day for patients with pancreatic transplants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood fractures in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum carcinoma, a calculation of the creatine inlays and a monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraph When switching from Ciclosporine to a tacrolimus-based therapy, be careful (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on tallow levels in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases under the help of full blood tacrolimus Talking controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent controls of the Tacrolimus Talking during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood sugar levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled by adjustment of Prograf to Advagraph, Dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that might alter the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Because Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood are not exceeding 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the full blood levels of tacrolimus in full blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may result in tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the closely meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have been shown to be therapy-resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data is available for the retarded formulation of Advagraph for the prevention of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tacrolism levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements that contain St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other plant remedies during treatment with Advagraph (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, cataracts described as cardiomyopathy were observed, which can therefore occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disruption are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overload and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood level with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by inhibiting gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as the CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone exposure, it is particularly cautious when making decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of tests on transplant patients do not indicate that in contrast to other immunosuppressants, an increased risk of adverse events is the outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1461">The adverse event profile of immunosuppressants can often not be precisely identified because of the patient's underlying disease and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1462">In the following, the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order: very common (≥ 1 / 100, ≤ 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 100), not known (frequency based on available data).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-Virus associated Nephropathy and JC-Virus associated progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppressive therapy including therapy with Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus can not be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be conveyed through its binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a specific series of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on T-helper cells, furthermore the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies reported observations in the large trials in which Prograf was applied to primary immunosuppression for liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation An interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral Prograf was reported to over 110 patients receiving either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, the bronchiolitis obliterative syndrome, was less frequently observed in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In patients treated with tacrolimus in 21.7% of the cases of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans in comparison to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be switched to Tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients being converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases where no acute graft rejection occurred was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterative syndroms was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicentre study with oral Prograf was performed on 205 patients who underwent a pancreas and kidney transplant following a randomised Tacrolimus (n = 103) trial or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, with excretion mainly via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraph was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in case of stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital heart defect caused by the lack of Factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether or not Advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Hemophilia A is a factor of VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"" "Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called" "" "recombinant DNA-technology" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, among them a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septic episodes with "excellent" respectively "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII-deficiency, the location and the extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma level (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injections all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute drawback are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses ranging from 20 to 40 I.U. of Factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity cannot be reached or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be based on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a well known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modifying Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates to the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients), all of whom had previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) diagnosed a FVIII inhibitor after previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients, 5 out of 25 (20%) treated patients with ADVATE treated inhibitors against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that were allergic to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which makes it necessary to submit PSURs every 6 months, so that the authorisation holder should apply for further extension procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company will withdraw its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the body's cells.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "" "that has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of subassemblies, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial documentation submitted, the CHMP generates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently proven that Advexin injection in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore provides benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 or older, the recommended dose of aerosol is twice daily a tablet to be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment commenced and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried off their symptoms every 12 hours to a diary and assessed using a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, patients who received aerosze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving deserloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenergic active ingredients or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from severe glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac or vascular diseases, including hypertension (hyperthyrosis), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrosis) or a hemorrhagic stroke (stroke) or a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, crushing or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), aerosol should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days since the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease over time in case of long-term use.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After swelling of the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, respectively within the 2 weeks after termination of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, dihydrogotamine or other deongestiva, which can be used peronal or nasally as a hinge of rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this group of patients and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunctions and the data is insufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a strengthening of the headaches) has to be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Treatment of the following patient groups is recommended: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck building or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be completed at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests because antihistaminika otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">No clinically relevant interactions nor changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed in the framework of clinical trials involving desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were given.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor system, no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a medium nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerosaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness that can lead to an impairment of the traffic density or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnoea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuce procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heartbeat, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordant pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth-dryness, pupil stiffness and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P selectivity to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, there was no increased incidence of drowsiness in the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause further sympathetic effects, such as increasing blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher compared with the overall result for the symptoms (except mucous membrane swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined on the basis of nasal mucous membrane swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study of the Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the plasma dose.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerosaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxyloloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole application of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to be exposed after the administration of an aerosze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin cannot identify any particular hazard to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination did not have any greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the pharmaceutical vigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms which occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and drowning or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosing the following symptoms or diseases when using Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • coronary heart beat, heart beat, heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking any medicine with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">The use in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aerosaze leads to dizziness or lowers the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerosze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of aerosze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot the dosage of Aerinaze If you forgot to take a dose in time, get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desoatadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing not, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver diseases was also very rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisat for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by comparing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadnoodles, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the scores (symptom scoring) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at urticaria, the decrease of the scores after six weeks with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius must not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the marketing of Aerius in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms terminate and can be resumed at their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed about the fact that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness that can lead to an impairment of the traffic density or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials across different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headaches; this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P selectivity to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study of multiple doses in which desloratadin was administered up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) for more than ten days, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, notwithstanding the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be easily recited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histaminfection is a causative factor in all urticular diseases, it is expected that, besides the chronic idiopathic urticaria, desloratadin also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the study was excluded from the study by the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population were comparable, a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved in 4% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies that CYP2D6 does not inhibit CYP2D6 and neither a medium nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desoatadin and Loratadin in a comparable degree of exposure to desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken separately from meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">Prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise and experience a higher number of substances (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who are normal metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol, so patients with hereditary problems should not use glucose intolerance, glucose-free absorption or sucrose-isomal insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was administered up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg. a day (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers did not detect an increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">With an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not impair psychomotor therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in increasing alcohol-induced performance impairment or increasing drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited-metabolizing phenotype was comparable in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations bigger with black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucaasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The burden (AUC) due to desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-time of approximately 120 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1812">The overall frequency of adverse events between the Desoatadine syrup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly deviate from the safety profile identified in adult patients.</seg>
<seg id="1813">At the recommended dose, Aerius processed as a bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the Aerius 5 mg lyophilisat for the declining formulation of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1814">There was no statistically significant or clinically significant clinical study of multiple doses in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1815">At a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The spread of this poorly metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adult (6%) and pediatric patients between 2 and 11 years (6%), and among black (adults 18%, children 16%) bigger than with Caucaasians (Awakse 2%, Children 3%), but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population.</seg>
<seg id="1817">In single dose Crossover studies by Aerius Melting tablet with Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisat, the formulations were bioequivalent.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Aerius 2.5 mg tablets were not examined for pediatric patients, but in combination with the dose-finding studies in children, the pharmacokinetic data for Aerius melting tablets endorse the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. formally announced that the company rejects its application for approval for the launch of Aflunov for the prevention of the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against the flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">When the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the part of the flu virus, which is contained in the vaccine, and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to form antibodies faster when contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane sheath of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the surface of the membrane that the human body recognizes as a foreign body) was disconnected, cleaned up and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data basis for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA Guidance on pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has tested which antiviral medicines the patient had previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of kritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, which has been dosed with low doses, was compared with 206 adults who used protease inhibitors earlier, compared with other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced viral load, but with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the viral load enhanced with kritonavir lowered the viral load as effective as other protease inhibitors after 16 weeks of treatment:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, there was a stronger waste of the viral load together with Ritonavir after four weeks, compared with the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 generase may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ampprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase must also not be used in patients receiving St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicine, which are degraded as well as aging and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in body fat distribution), osteoarthritis (bone tissue death) or immune activation syndromes (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of generic ase in combination with kritonavir in patients who previously had not taken any protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the transport of agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Agenerase capsules are usually to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amputavir together with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ampprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amdynamite as a solution to take up is 14% less than from Amdynamite as a capsule; hence, Agenerase Capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg of Amdynamite twice a day together with 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the enhanced addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amandavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amdynamite that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agenerase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate-severe liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent use should be performed with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, contraindicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also mediums of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of ampprenavir while taking Amdynamite (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that aging or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids including Cushing Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of agroase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Standard Ratio), methods are available to determine the active ingredient concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amonavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with ampprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is insufficient to assess the nature of the interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Amdynamite, the patients should therefore be monitored on Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycoloride content of the Agenerase solution to take, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be applied with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Aging should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which drugs were required to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hemmophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol intake, severe immunosuppression, higher Body Mass Index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 mediums with low therapeutical latitude must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also mediums of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir should not be combined with medicines whose active agents are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amdynamite, which can lead to a virological failure and a development of resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In attempting to balance the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amdynamite can be degraded by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already received St. John's wort, the amour mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and replace the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with Amdynamite (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amdynamite Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials doses of 600 mg of Amdynamite twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% reduced if Amrupavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of ampprenavir in plasma, which were achieved with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambuor (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amputavir and caletra can not be given, however a close-meshed monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine in combination with didanosine, but due to the fantasic component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of didanosine and agenerase lie at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, in combination with amputavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amdynamite and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Nevirapine effects on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of amputavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Should these medicines be used simultaneously, caution is advisable since Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution must be taken when these drugs are used together; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amdynamite and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of ampprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be at least half of the recommended dose although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asterase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of foscopyrcavities and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69times compared to the value observed once daily without concurrent application of fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including mediums, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may also interact with aging.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as agenerase as it may result in resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants, known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with ampprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma crucible of Amdynamite.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israeldipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased 10 through amputavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use with agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects with PDE5 inhibitors associated with hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days in subjects, the fluorosonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous administration of generase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids, unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amodour is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations can be recommended until the mirror stabilization, since the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amputavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, agitase cannot be used together with the orally taken midazolam (see section 4.3), while with simultaneous use of agenerase with parenteral midazolam caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Midazolam around 3-4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with ampprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on Opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as to how to adjust the Amdynamite dose if Amdynamite is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Increased monitoring of the INR (International Regised Ratio) with simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Ampprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactating rats, but it is not known whether ampprenavir is transferred to people in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">During the lactation period, a reproduction study of pregnant rats, given from the embedding in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase of the 12 body weight in the seed.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of ampprenavir on the parent animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's harmlessness has been studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, rising early and rarely led to the breakdown of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are related to taking Agenerase or another medicine at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events mentioned below are from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive 200 mg of Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as associated with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and faal fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral unpretreated individuals who had been treated with amonavir in combination with lamivudine / Zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stick-chopping) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under amputavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderately marked, erythematous or makulopapilous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amdynamite.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with a severe immunity defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg of agroase twice a day along with low dose kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; one exception were increases in triglyceride and CPK values, which were frequent in patients who received Agenerase along with low dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ampprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-Pol- polyproteins with the result of formation of unmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amdynamite in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amdynamavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amdynamite against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with the currently approved fossils / kritonavir dosages - as in other ritonavir treated treatment schemes with proteaseinmators - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of foscopyrr with 100mg of kritonavir twice a day in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred by week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 sealed patients with protease inhibitors demonstrated resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M46I, I62A, D60E, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fossip-avir / 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients with protease inhibitors treated patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance tests, genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amputavir / kritonavir or fosamprenavir / kritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, M36I, I54A / L / M / S / T / S, I84V and L90M in combination with increased probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of specific mutations or mutations may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amputavir / kritonavir or fosonavir / kritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to amponavir creates a certain resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, however, remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross resistance between amputavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance pathways, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretrovirally non-treated patients, in which a foscope virus (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against Tipranavir), indinavir / kritonavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / kritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, ampprenavir reserves its activity against some other protease inhibitors resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failing therapy is recommended in order to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which adults treated with a virological failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml) together with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and a standard of care (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-slip threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbioosterated asterase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children between 2 and 18 years of age, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase's solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosed kritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs treated together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients included in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unbioosterous" "" "agenerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (Tmax) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amdynamite (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amdynamite with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of ampprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves on a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of ampprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound ammonium which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound ammonia remains constant fluctuates the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">For this reason, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 and represent a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily ammonia exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ampprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase's solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the impact of renal dysfunction may be low on the elimination of amponavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to ampprenavir plasma levels comparable to those that are achieved in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of amputavir twice a day without simultaneous dose of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity of mice and rats in male animals benign hepatocellular adenomas in dosages, which correspond to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of ampprenavir, corresponded.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the actual exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and therapeutical applications, there was little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames Test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test of rats and chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral lymphocytes, Amrupavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of the alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of agenerase nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both in the controls and in the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure that was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the enhanced addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amandavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amdynamite that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Concurrent use should be performed with caution in patients with low or mild liver dysfunction, contraindicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Standard Ratio), methods are available to determine the active ingredient concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Aging should be set in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral therapy and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amdynamite, which can lead to a virological failure and a development of resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increases for Cmax by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amdynamite Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of ampprenavir in plasma, which were achieved with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambuor (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amputavir and caletra can not be given, however a close-meshed monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amdynamite and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Caution must be taken when these drugs are used together; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amdynamite and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israeldipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amputavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study where Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days in subjects, the fluorosonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">Increased monitoring of the INR (International Regised Ratio) with simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindrone) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin by amonavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amdynamite in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amdynamavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">On the other hand, ampprenavir reserves its activity against some other protease inhibitors resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the anticipated benefits of "unbundled" agenerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound ammonia remains constant fluctuates the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of Amdynamite as a solution to take up is 14% less than from Amdynamite as a capsule; hence, Agenerase Capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="2102">In addition, as no dose recommendation is required for simultaneous use of Agenerase solution to take and low dosed ritonavir, this combination may be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for Amdynamite is not deemed necessary, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycoloride content, Agenerase is contraindicated in case of small children and children under 4 years, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) a lower probability of response to Imiquimod therapy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod has not been studied for the treatment of actinical keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data about the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinical keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data about the actinical keratose on the underarms and hands does not support the efficacy in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease over the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod-cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions are causing great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 ac- lesions showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immunostimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with care in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were achieved either after a unique topical application (&gt; 5ng / ml), no recommendation can be given to the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related side effects in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions on the site of treatment of the foals (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod treated patients).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The Balioma patients treated with Imiquimod Cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, most likely or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinical keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimod cream frequently led to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreation / drafting (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the study protocol, the clinical evidence planned according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod-cream very common to severe eryissues (31%), severe erosions (13%), and too heavy scorching and calcification (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies evaluating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of the actinical keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental single oral shot of 200 mg of Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The most clinically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200mg consisted of hypotonia which normalized after oral or IV levels of hydration.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were demonstrated after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the tendencies in an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the total of 119 patients treated with Imiquimod, the disease was completely healed; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, vs. 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five-stroke applications per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary structural basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients had been clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hyperkeratotic, non hypertrophic acne lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the hairless scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinically healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The permitted indications of external foals, actinical keratose and super-cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream has been studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, Placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod Creme by the skin of 58 patients with actinical keratose was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml for the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2hour half-time after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month trial for the dermal toxicity of the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen-weight; a study for the dermal application, which was carried out for four months, yielded no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with dermal administration on three days a week did not induce tumours in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk for humans is considered to be very small due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2273">The following neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or hospital with revitalizing equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines before they are administered to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of the GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered GAG concentrations in the urine by approximately 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in over 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will check all the new information, possibly known, and update this summary if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients receiving aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the marketing of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA-technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect related to infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in a proper clinical environment where rehabilitation centres are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related response must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience with the resumption of treatment after a longer period of time, the risk of hypersensitivity reaction has to be cautiously preceded by an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyretics) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a mild or moderate infusion-related response, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related response, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have decreased, a treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is present on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended to not breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were mostly classified as infusion-related reactions, observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older for a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often performed in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 100); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory tract and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe follow-up form and a duration of treatment of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a seroconversion within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, whereby the patients aged under 5 years of age usually came to a seroconversion (on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study), no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it never came to serokony.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low-low antibody levels reported a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody titres.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidan activity in vitro that appeared not to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even though the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely over manose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an accelerated expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the absolute minimum distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3,5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement of lung function and ability to be healed compared to the placebo group, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme Group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV has not been clinically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased proportionally to the size of adults.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first four weeks a clear waste of the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg of creatinin) was determined, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous clinical manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, which summarizes clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FeV, range in the 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe follow-up form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- mirrors in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a growth in size (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) noted after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form indicated a normal mental developmental speed, whereas in the older patients with severe follow-up form only limited or no progress was observed in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent a substitute alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available to evaluate each year, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (cancer for cancer), and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, the patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and obtain injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, in addition to or after the gift of cisplatin, a "antiemetics" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluids) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood counts are changed or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, deposed or the dose can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed thus slows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetremixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta were compared in a study to 571 patients with advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time of 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which cancer did not attack squamous epithelial cells when administration of Alimta treated longer lives compared with the comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the glass bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- kal-advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² of KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the telemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell carcinoma following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed-Gift and the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">At least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days before the first dose of Pemetremixed and the dose must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week prior to the first match-mixed dosage as well as after each third operating cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetry, a full blood image should be created before each application, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadir of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the predictive treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery patients have to be treated according to indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that apply to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Level 2 Blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dose-reductio- a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or continue with the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, an increased risk of adverse effects exists in patients aged 65 years or above.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Cretan-in-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a creatinin-clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin border value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the occurrence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored in terms of bone marrow intraocular pressure and Pemetremixed cannot be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils again have a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cytes again has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed need to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (CSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients receiving a therapy with Pemetremixed have to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients experiencing these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion is to be considered before the Pemetremixed-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with pemetremixed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damaging of the reproductive capacity by means of Pemetremixed, men should be advised in front of the treatment chin to obtain advice regarding the spermaceration.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal antiphlosis (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced pemetry deposition resulting in increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) can be used for high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs is available with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided with pemetre- for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the tine status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for use of pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed may not be applied during pregnancy except if it is strictly required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since there is the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity by means of Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blockage of the spermacia.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic anti-folate that exerts its effect by interrupting the metabolic processes that are important for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetremixed acts as an anti-folate with multiple targets by blocking the thymidylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrological reductase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomized, easy-blind Phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin for chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma, showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had clinically meaningful advantage of survival compared to those patients who were only curled with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot break down some fats in the food, resulting in a quarter of the fats led with food undigested to the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies on patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients with Alli had 60 mg of weight after one year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The study of alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily spots at the anus, flatus (winch) with marrow, marrow ldl, oily / oily chair, departure oily secretion (faeces), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients treated with iclosporin (preventing organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (with which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or cholesterol (liver disease), and in pregnant women or in nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for placing orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypocaloric, fat-induced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is however only minimally resorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Emptiness (see Section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated blood cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take extra contraceptive measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (international normal ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentration of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotins remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose Amiodarone, a marginal decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100), often (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000), not known (frequency based on available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of Orlistat is unknown, since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Most of the reported cases of orlistat overdose reported either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by the lipase inhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect forms in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active serin-rest of gastric and pancreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials for adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter that changes the body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization) was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those participating in study who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months, the greatest loss of weight occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% with orlistat -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103,7 cm) and placebo -3,6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, for therapeutic dosages, non-metabolized orlistat in the plasma could only be proved sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonal ring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-form leucine group), identified nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration in a study of obese patients.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be seen as a special danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks following the beginning of the treatment, as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimise nutritional deficiencies: • Begin a few days, or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an anti-inflammatory).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the drug inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was examined for 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Aloxi throughout the European Union to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting with severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for preventing nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute isleus after injection should be tightly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is offered with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that lengthen the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not to be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron hibited the activity of the five chemotherapeutics directed against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicine and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration of oral Metocloplamids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromaine, fluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, chinidine, ranitidine, kritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the Palonosetron Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences regarding the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micrograms (total of 633 patients), which at least could be associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the date of performance (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; no dose-active relationships were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume a dialysis is probably not effective therapy with an alopic overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours) were given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving significantly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy individuals and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to three consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) compared to the one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg of measured value; however, the Cmax was higher after the use of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection in healthy patients, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale elimination rate is increased and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron increases, but a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only on expositions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 of preclinical studies indicated that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans) which were given daily over two years led to increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pankreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is estimated to be low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommended for the use of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml Injection Solution for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same medicinal product approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medical prescription" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon is to be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease called viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue shows damage, and the values of the liver enzyme alanine amino acid ferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medical drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus were detected in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been voiced that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C related to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease decreased again in more patients than in the reference medical device; in addition, Alpheon has more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study was not adequately validated to determine the extent to which the drug acts as an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (skin infection accompanied by crusts) and small infected infirmids (crack or cutting), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or likely caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altartargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin area to be treated must not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients treated with placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were considered together with skin patients, approximately 90% of patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with alttargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the ordering site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for the marketing of Altargo within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or severe local irritation by applying the Retapamines ointment, the treatment is to be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected spot occurs after a 2-3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamines and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been achieved in humans after topical application on deported skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the mean return of Retapamines AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamines ointment on pedicated skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retinosulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with alttargo should be continued / terminated, it is possible to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo used was the most frequently reported side effect of irritation at the date of the administration, affecting about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomales protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, partially blocking P-binding interactions, preventing the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of Retapamulin at at least some infection forms seem to be questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus were detected, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamines ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and peeled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamines ointment twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) is 660 times lower than the retina inulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro screening on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 worn skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, at oral dosing ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (equivalent to ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2717">If irritation or other signs and symptoms appear at the treated point, you should quit the application of alttargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo unless prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment is out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization and ensures that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresh dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the natural defense of the body)" "" "as it can fight against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same constituents as the inoculant TwinMaster Adult, which has been approved since 1996 and the mandatory vaccination of Twinsui children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinsuc adults and Twinsuc children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of Ambience protection was similar in a six-month and a 12-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied in patients who are potentially hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals Inc. a permit for the placing on the market of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for Pridimmunisation with Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccines, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is given after the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster shot is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HBsAg and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis B vaccination need a booster shot as protection, as they may also be protected by the immunological memory in case of non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, it is recommended that the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units contains a Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value is achieved after priming, so that in these cases the administration of other vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intra-male injection or intramuscular administration of the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, Ambience can be injected subcutaneously as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mastic- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturgency, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the previous Thiomerage and preservative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccination doses of Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines between 1 and 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturities on a calculation basis per capita dose, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50,7% of the subjects, compared with 39,1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of subjects administered by Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% in subjects that had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturities was comparable highly per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who got Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and maturities was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study of 1 to 11 years of inoculation, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambience group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambience a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines reported on severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccination scheme with the combination vaccine with Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies carried out at the age of 1 to 15 years, serum conversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-can vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme for persons who were between 12 and 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units with formalinactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial in 12- to including 15-year-olds, it was possible to show that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme to the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was given at the same time with the booster of a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps-scoring vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and serum conversion rates as for previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resuspening to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foodborne foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted by other means, such as water contaminated by water.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix may not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses of vaccination, (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">Allergic reaction may be caused by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B in your child, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection before the vaccination series ends.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected with people who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defenses, or if you / your child undergo hematalysis / subtract.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take / take other medicines (including those who have been vaccinated without prescribing) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently / or have received / or immunoglobulins (antibodies) or that is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated at separate places and as different extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Traditionally, Ambirix is not given pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix request inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on data acquired since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP showed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was put into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine are limited because of low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage caused by high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - split by several individual doses to the meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomiescheme (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonial could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammosis can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste problems, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented excessive ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of the lifetime).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life) then there is an indication of the use of hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb phosphate synthetase or ornibscaris.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinate synthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk of the genesis of esophagusulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be applied with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as for clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and oil formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous formulation of phenylacetate on young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of the patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed to be associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorextic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactatazidosis, severe hypokalemia, bulletytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred during a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neuro-toxicity when administered intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of surplus nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram taken in sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even when treated with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hematalysis, the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornibscarpathian deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney by glutamine with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also investigated in cancer patients following intravenous sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after ingesting measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cykloric disorder or hemoglobin, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) did not detectable phenylacetate in plasma after a nocturnal fast.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no autoclaved effects when treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either orally (infants and children not yet able to swallow the tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrostoma or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb phosphate synthetase or ornibscaris.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrate), lesions in the pyramidal cells of the brain cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorextic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactatazidosis, severe hypokalemia, bulletytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">According to rumchiometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the secretion of surplus value.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate is produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form 15 minutes after ingesting measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the middle measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding you should not take AMMONAPS, as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, relapse of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with instable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "Stuplift" (an anomalous measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is given and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox in the sole application or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients were often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and they received additional medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab und Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without GPI administration - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revitalization) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was equally effective in terms of all indicators such as heparin, except in severe bleeding where it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as for people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the transport of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is used in a further sequence, an additional 0.5 mg / kg can be given and the infusion can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be given immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous injection of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus gift from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the use of the anodiac should be given intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to PCI (whether treated with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second intake dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second intake dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the III- PCI trial (REPLACE-2), which was admitted to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus with no dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of unfractioned Heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active agent or any other component or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of hemostasis and / or irreversible irritation. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients should be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in the case of PCI patients with Bivalirudin, most of the hemorrhages of arterial puncture occur in patients who undergo a pericular coronary intervention (PCI), bleeding occurs in principle all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudin is once again reached the level existing before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocytes aggregates), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocytes aggregates or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostaseology parameters must be checked regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, unbinding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unpolluted Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalirudin Group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among Bivalirudin than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area that required a radiological or surgical intervention, hematoma of the hemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, the use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed bleeding-localizations that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudin Group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among Bivalirudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organclasses in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, the treatment with a bivalirudin is immediately abort and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thromatic inhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as to the anion-binding region of thromboin, regardless of whether thromboin is bound in the liquid phase or on clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of Bivalirudin to thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin is slowly splitting the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, it was not possible to induce thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticolagulatory effect, which is confirmed by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the event that a PCI was performed following a PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractional heparin or ennoxenaparin was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST lifting attack (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before starting the angiography (at the time of randomization) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, requiring angiography within 72 hours, were equally distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients undertook 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1 year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for the patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before the angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of Angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a pericular coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that as peptide, Bivalirudin as peptide enters into his amino acid components with subsequent reutilization of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminale sequence through thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination occurs in patients with normal renal function after a process of first order with a terminal half-time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can no longer detect particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The toxicity of animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at exposure up to 10-fold of the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects as a result of a long-term physiological strain in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to those in clinical use, even with very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the manufacturing of the ready-to-use solution 17 does not take place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours to store at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose throughputs from type 1 glass to 10 ml, which are sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes is put into a bottle of Angiox and slightly waved until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken from the glass bottle and diluted with 5% glucose to the injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml of bivalirudin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose (sugar) in the blood or can not process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin collisions.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin sysin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose-ogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin may be reduced in patients with reduced liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effective strength, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method may result in a change in insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3. insufficient doses or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the effective profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamin-oxidase, propoxyphene, salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened under the effect of sympathetic medicines such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin circulates in human breast milk, but generally, insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it absorbed by oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable drugs known from clinical studies, grouped by system organ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, lightheadedness, excessive hun-, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person or treated by a doctor with intravenous glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucoagal injection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (in particular by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin resistance the effectiveness occurs faster and the effect is shorter than with the normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mliontus, insulin lulitis in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucosine effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportional increase in the glucosine effect, just like the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosine effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was clear that a comparable postprandiale glycemic control is achieved in an application of insulin sysin 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Once Insulinglulisin was done 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranal control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">When insulin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- nudes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin dosage in 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin intake in 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal in comparison with human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
