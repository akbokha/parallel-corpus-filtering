<seg id="1">While I had been visiting the US at least once a year since 2012, this was going to be the first time that I would live there. </seg>
<seg id="2">And it was an exciting moment for me. </seg>
<seg id="3">My affection for America runs deep. </seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up watching American movies, dancing to her music, reading her writers and playing her sports. </seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, the country has had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist in large part because of an American film. </seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington play Gray Grantham in "The Pelican Brief", a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts' law student, exposes a murderous conspiracy by an oil magnate to stack the US Supreme Court with justices friendly to his interests. </seg>
<seg id="7">I was hooked. </seg>
<seg id="8">To paraphrase Method Man, “I was, like, this is the truth, forget everything else, this is what I’d like to do with my life.” </seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona only served to confirm my admiration for the US. </seg>
<seg id="10">I would say to people, “America is the only country I have ever lived in whose diversity was so welcoming that you can be exactly who you are and easily find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.” </seg>
<seg id="11">I even penned a love letter, waxing lyrical about her greatness. </seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump happened. </seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the man’s xenophobia and racism. </seg>
<seg id="14">To me, the most extraordinary aspect of his rise is how easily he wears his bigotry. </seg>
<seg id="15">He doesn’t dog-whistle, to borrow a turn of phrase. </seg>
<seg id="16">He straight-up uses a regular human whistle, as a former colleague put it, and openly declares his disdain for Muslims, Latinos, African-Americans and women. </seg>
<seg id="17">Yet people have responded to his message, voting for him in droves. </seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he secured to win the Republican primary was the highest number garnered by a party nominee in history. </seg>
<seg id="19">I was dumbfounded. </seg>
<seg id="20">Who are these Americans supporting this bigot, I asked myself? </seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn’t square Trump and his voters with the folks I got to know during my time in Phoenix. </seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of a journalism program that hosts people from all over the world, and a deeply spiritual man, with whom I would talk about Islam and its history. </seg>
<seg id="23">Nor did Trump’s worldview match with Peter Bhatia, now the editor at the Cincinnati Inquirer. </seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I bonded over our shared love of hoops and spent countless hours watching the Phoenix Suns play. </seg>
<seg id="25">Trump’s intolerance is also at odds with the generosity I experienced spending time with Sandy Bahr — a life-time advocate for the environment — and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like a son. </seg>
<seg id="26">Nor did it match with the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who patiently, and always with grace, helped me and my colleagues better adjust to the complexity of life in America. </seg>
<seg id="27">Then there's Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped my career advance. </seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values they embody deepened my love for America. </seg>
<seg id="29">So even as Trump was barreling his way to the Republican nomination, they provided me with a counterpoint to his narrow vision of America. </seg>
<seg id="30">It turns out they were the exception rather than the rule. </seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8th 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, handed the presidency to a man, despite—or maybe because of—his contempt for non-white people. </seg>
<seg id="32">Coming to terms with the idea that people voted for Trump either because they shared in his racism and bigotry, or that they were willing to overlook those things, is soul-crushing. </seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump voters racists. </seg>
<seg id="34">A friend of mine says labelling people like this is what has led to this moment. </seg>
<seg id="35">It is flippant and dismissive, and suggests an inability to understand those who think and act in ways different from us. </seg>
<seg id="36">It says to folks that their concerns and fears about the frenetic changes happening in their communities are not valid. </seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, chose Trump as a way to re-assert control over a country they may believe is leaving them behind? </seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, was it their way of saying, we still matter in this new America? </seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="40">Yet, one cannot escape, in David Remnick's words, the cruelty of the decision to elevate a man who drips with disdain for those who don't look like him. </seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash", as the great Van Jones put it, has killed the very thing that makes America great. </seg>
<seg id="42">Millions around the world treasure the American ideal — whether myth or reality, it is a powerful idea nonetheless — that whatever your creed or background America will welcome you. </seg>
<seg id="43">After all this is a country that chose as its president, twice, the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he tells it, is possible nowhere else in the world. </seg>
<seg id="44">By electing Donald Trump, however, a huge chunk of white America is abandoning that promise and telling the world: fuck diversity, religious freedoms and the whole notion of pluralism. </seg>
<seg id="45">In post-11/9 America, the white man is back in charge, they said. </seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have been thinking about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election. </seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan engaged in a call-and response with the crowd. </seg>
<seg id="48">“Donald Trump, would my son Captain Humayun Khan have a place in your America?” Mr. Khan asked. </seg>
<seg id="49">The audience responded with a resounding, “No!” </seg>
<seg id="50">“Would Muslims have a place in your America?” </seg>
<seg id="51">“No!” the crowd bellowed. </seg>
<seg id="52">“Would Latinos have a place in your America?” </seg>
<seg id="53">“No!” they replied. </seg>
<seg id="54">“Would African-Americans have a place in your America?” </seg>
<seg id="55">“No!” they said, their voices growing louder. </seg>
<seg id="56">“Would anyone who is not like you have a place in your America?” </seg>
<seg id="57">He got a unanimous and vociferous, “No!” </seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded by saying, “Thankfully, Mr. Trump, this isn’t your America.” 36 hours later, Mr. Khan has been rebuked. </seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son gave his life had sent him a message. </seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump’s country, the message said. </seg>
<seg id="61">And people who look like Mr. Khan may not have a place in this new America anymore. </seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart. </seg>

<seg id="67">Recycled instruments orchestra from Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC. </seg>
<seg id="68">Image on Flickr by user OEA-OAS (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0). </seg>
<seg id="69">What do a Mexican music school from the Vicente Guerrero community in the state of Oaxaca and children from the Paraguayan city of Cateura have in common? </seg>
<seg id="70">That the music being played in both places has not only changed the kids' lives, but has a deep connection to...garbage. </seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives alongside garbage </seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, just 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca &#8212; an old colonial city that's popular with tourists &#8212; but a world away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world famous cuisine. </seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de música (The music band) has played in the community. It's a project that has evolved into a symphony orchestra made up of children and adolescents, who have found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments: </seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a focal point for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca. </seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about the project: </seg>
<seg id="76">The community, in one of Mexico’s poorest states, has a reputation for drug abuse and gang violence. </seg>
<seg id="77">But it is undergoing a transformation after a fortuitous encounter with a French pilot helped launch a musical venture offering rare hope to its youth. </seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitment to the musical group very seriously, according to local media outlet Noticias Oaxaca NVI: </seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they get out of school, they almost run back to their homes; and as soon as they have lunch, they head through dusty roads to take up their grand passion. </seg>
<seg id="80">They always arrive smiling, with lively eyes, playing around, amidst hustle and bustle. They learn day by day to skilfully play the trumpet, the trombone, the piccolo, the clarinet, the oboe, the flute, the French horn, the kettleddrum, the bongos and the conga. </seg>
<seg id="81">Garbage made into music </seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south from Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura &#8212; a village practically located on top of the main landfill of Asunción, Paraguay's capital &#8212; play instruments made out of recycled materials: </seg>
<seg id="83">musical pieces with recycled instruments, made from domestic solid waste, at the musical instrument workshop the group has in Cateura, where recyclers under the guidance of Favio Chávez have started to use "garbage" parts to fashion instruments that make musical sounds. </seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion instruments, all made out of garbage. </seg>
<seg id="85">Their repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music, music by The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, among others. </seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by US newspaper the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician who is teaching the children of Cateura to play, remembers their early days: </seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach in the same place where the parents were working in the trash . The children knew nothing about music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children. </seg>
<seg id="88">That all changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made out of garbage. </seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra of assembled instruments, called The Recycled Orchestra. </seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" chronicled the musical effort: </seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about a billion tons of garbage a year. </seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with it and from it are the poor – like the people of Cateura, Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="93">And here they are transforming it into beauty. </seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra as it takes its inspiring spectacle of trash-into-music around the world. </seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even performed its music for Pope Francis: </seg>
<seg id="96">These two groups, as well as some others, show that with music, the possibilities are endless. These East African Countries Show How Teamwork and Technology Can Thwart Illegal Fishing &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="97">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa — an endeavor working to halt large-scale illegal fishing. </seg>
<seg id="98">This post by Emma Bryce was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that highlights international environmental solutions in action, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement. </seg>
<seg id="99">Early in December 2012, a South Korean vessel called the Premier entered the Indian Ocean to fish. </seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, authorities knew that the boat had been fishing illegally in Liberian waters before it made its way to Africa’s other coast. </seg>
<seg id="101">That raised the ire of East African countries, which weren’t keen to welcome a lawbreaker into their seas. </seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique, and the Seychelles rapidly mobilized against the vessel, shutting it out of their ports and refusing to grant it a fishing license. </seg>
<seg id="103">“All of a sudden, the Premier was surrounded by countries that were saying no to everything,” recalls Benedict Kiilu, a Kenyan principal fisheries officer who was part of the team that tracked the vessel at the time. </seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, unable to land its catch, the disgraced ship was finally driven out of the region. </seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was forced to pay US$2 million to Liberia for plundering its fish. </seg>
<seg id="106">The beating heart of this crime-busting, resource-conserving effort was FISH-i Africa, a network of countries committed to sharing fisheries intelligence that was established in 2012 by the not-for-profit Stop Illegal Fishing. </seg>
<seg id="107">Composed of the six countries that drove out the Premier, along with Madagascar and Somalia, FISH-i Africa seeks to form a united front against illegal — or “pirate” — fishing. </seg>
<seg id="108">“It’s eight like-minded countries working together to share information and stand shoulder to shoulder where illegal fishing is concerned,” says Tony Long, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Ending Illegal Fishing Project, which provides technical support to aid FISH-i’s efforts. </seg>
<seg id="109">Because illegal fishing is unregulated — meaning catch is concealed and almost impossible to trace — it has become a major driver of overfishing. </seg>
<seg id="110">By flouting the rules designed to protect certain habitats and species, it can also undermine vulnerable ecosystems and threaten marine species. </seg>
<seg id="111">But, where attempts to fight it were once hampered by bureaucracy and snail’s-pace information sharing between countries, now they’re happening in real-time on FISH-i’s digital communications platform. </seg>
<seg id="112">Here, member countries exchange vessel license lists, news about suspect activities and details obtained during port inspections to build up a record of the vessels entering their waters. </seg>
<seg id="113">FISH-i also closely tracks vessels’ activities on the high seas using satellite data and shares that information via the platform. </seg>
<seg id="114">This helps authorities flag vessels that may be fishing in off-limits areas, or those that betray unusual travel patterns that suggest they’re transferring fish illegally between boats. </seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, these investigations can reveal whether vessels have appropriate licenses, where they’ve been fishing and perhaps if they have a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that wise up to illegal fishers’ transgressions then have grounds to shut their ports to these vessels so they can’t sell their catch or even to force them to pay fines, as in the case of the Premier. </seg>
<seg id="117">“It’s a real financial loss to the owner, which means illegal fishing isn’t profitable anymore. </seg>
<seg id="118">That’s really what we want to achieve,” says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa, a consultancy that works to combat illegal fishing in Africa and provides support to FISH-i. </seg>
<seg id="119">United Front </seg>
<seg id="120">The platform was created to reclaim the estimated US$200 million in revenue that the eight FISH-i countries lose annually to illegal fishers invading East African waters. </seg>
<seg id="121">Home to the world’s second-most productive tuna fishery, this region attracts commercial fishing vessels from around the world, including illegal fishers — whose activities range from using false flags, fake licenses and fictitious names to fishing prohibited species and fishing in protected waters. </seg>
<seg id="122">“They’ll exploit the lack of international collaboration and take advantage of a patchy system,” says Long. </seg>
<seg id="123">“In the past a vessel might be fishing illegally, and one country might say, ‘You can’t come to my port,’ whereas the next country would say, ‘Come to mine.’” </seg>
<seg id="124">This loophole is exactly what FISH-i is now trying to close. </seg>
<seg id="125">So far, the united front is working. </seg>
<seg id="126">Since it was founded, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspect ships. </seg>
<seg id="127">It has identified criminal networks distributing fake fishing licenses in Tanzania, exposed vessels using multiple fraudulent identities and tracked down fugitive ships. </seg>
<seg id="128">Its relationship with INTERPOL, the international crime investigation agency, also enables FISH-i to widely share and receive information about pirate fishing. </seg>
<seg id="129">“Some of the investigations we are doing are going into quite substantial organized crime networks,” says Bergh. </seg>
<seg id="130">Trygg Mat Tracking analyst Duncan Copeland is building a system to help FISH-i more precisely pinpoint suspect boats. </seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa. </seg>
<seg id="132">FISH-i’s evolving satellite detection system is also helping it get around the hurdle of illegal vessels that try to avoid discovery. </seg>
<seg id="133">“There are very sophisticated structures illegal fishers are using to hide their operations and their locations, which is what we’re trying to deconstruct,” says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst of Trygg Mat Tracking, a not-for-profit fisheries intelligence resource that provides technical support to FISH-i. </seg>
<seg id="134">Some ships turn off their automatic identification systems, for instance, which makes them impervious to satellite tracking. </seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is helping to build a system that combines multiple layers of information to help FISH-i pinpoint criminal ships with greater precision. </seg>
<seg id="136">Model Program </seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i’s team of African nations have an impact on the decidedly global problem of illegal fishing? </seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, president of the nonprofit SkyTruth, thinks so. </seg>
<seg id="139">Recently SkyTruth, Google and the marine advocacy group Oceana launched Global Fishing Watch, an open-access satellite platform that reveals the location of any trackable ship in the world. </seg>
<seg id="140">“Teaming up with your neighbors to get a better operating picture of who’s doing what, where, just makes sense,” he says. “This is an opportunity for countries to get together and pool their intelligence resources, and we should be doing that at a global scale.” </seg>
<seg id="141">(The Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar global vessel-tracking project, called Eyes on the Seas, that plans to start assisting FISH-i by spring 2017.) </seg>
<seg id="142">In addition to earmarking criminals, there’s evidence that FISH-i’s activities deter crime, too. </seg>
<seg id="143">Whereas vessels used to fish without a license and face few consequences, now they know they’re being watched. </seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some FISH-i countries have seen a 33 percent rise in fishing revenue as vessels purchase more licenses. </seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i helped Somalia home in on the Greko 1, inspectors found banned trawl nets on board. </seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa. </seg>
<seg id="147">“We’re a specimen for study.” In West Africa, where illegal fishing usurps several hundred million dollars a year, the West Africa Task Force was formed in 2015 by six nations to combat illegal fishing — and it’s based entirely on FISH-i’s model. </seg>
<seg id="148">“There is certainly the goal to eventually see more of these task force type structures set up in other regions,” Copeland says. </seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i’s newest member, Somalia, had its first major triumph when in October it cornered the Greko 1 — a fake-flagged vessel that not only was fishing without a license using banned trawl nets, but also had invaded an off-limits area reserved for Somali fishers. </seg>
<seg id="150">“By taking action against the Greko 1, are sending a strong signal that they will act against illegal fishing,” says Bergh. </seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, it’s yet another sign of its success — proof that its unique, collaborative approach really works to protect the ocean’s natural resources across its range. <!-- Code Embed v2.2.1 --> <!-- End of Code Embed code --> Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist based in London, where she writes about the environment, technology and food. </seg>

<seg id="153">Tension Mounts After Demonstrators Promise to "Take Back Venezuela" in Countrywide Protests &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="154">Street movements in Venezuela appear to mark the beginning of impassioned demonstrations against the government's refusal to hold a recall referendum against president Nicolás Maduro. </seg>
<seg id="155">Image: Detail from a photograph taken by María Alejandra Mora during the marches in Maracaibo in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="156">Published under Creative Commons license. </seg>
<seg id="157">Following the Venezuelan government's refusal to hold the recall referendum as requested by the opposition, Venezuelans took to the streets in their thousands in the face of what they see as a dead end in negotiations over the country's political and economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="158">Images of these protests and the arguments both for and against the referendum can be followed via the #LaTomaDeVenezuela hashtag. </seg>
<seg id="159">The conversation also has local elements with marches that have taken place in parts of the country other than the capital Caracas, such as in the plains region of Barinas, the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, the central northern state of Carabobo, and Margarita island in the region of Nueva Esparta. </seg>
<seg id="160">Economic and political instability &#8212; heavily linked to the collapse of the oil price &#8212; has been steadily growing in Venezuela, resulting in acute shortages of food and medicine for ordinary Venezuelans. </seg>
<seg id="161">For many opposition supporters, the exit of President Nicolás Maduro and his administration could help usher in much-needed changes, while Congress, where the opposition now holds a majority, has been pushing in vain to bring impeachment proceedings against Maduro to the Supreme Court he retains control over. While the national electoral body agreed to holding a referendum, the Maduro administration has backed away from endorsing what would effectively amount to a vote on its mandate to continue governing, ensuring that six different courts rejected the process. Maduro has also refused to recognise a symbolic "political trial" of the president that Congress has promised to hold in the absence of an impeachment trial. </seg>
<seg id="162">In her most recent article about the government's decision, Venezuelan Global Voices author Marianne Díaz explains: </seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of social, political and economic crisis, with the highest violence and inflation rates in the world (it is predicted that inflation will close out the year at 500%), and against a backdrop of grave and complex food and medicine shortages, for many Venezuelans a recall referendum was the only path that would allow the country to recover its lost institutional structures and create a governance pact. </seg>
<seg id="164">An announcement made by the Democratic Unity Roundtable or MUD (a coalition bringing together parties and politicians opposed to the ruling party) urged demonstrators to join a rally on October 27 in support of Congress, to take part in a 12-hour strike the following day, and to march on Miraflores palace - the seat of the Venezuelan government &#8212; on November 3. </seg>
<seg id="165">Twitter reacted quickly to the announcement: </seg>
<seg id="166">#LlegóLaHora Venezuela: tomorrow @AsambleaVE , Friday national civic strike and #3N everybody to Caracas for the march on Miraflores. </seg>
<seg id="167">Spread the word! </seg>
<seg id="168">.@MariaCorinaYA with @soyfdelrincon "Tomorrow we will be on the streets accompanying the #AN for the dismissal of @NicolasMaduro" </seg>
<seg id="169">"The Taking of Venezuela" </seg>
<seg id="170">The first of the protests under "The Taking of Venezuela" slogan took place on Wednesday, October 26. </seg>
<seg id="171">Images shared in real time from the marches showed sizeable participation in different parts of the country and also confrontations between demonstrators, police and the pro-government camp. </seg>
<seg id="172">Amongst the most shared photos was one of a protester shouting through riot shields: "You're going to kill me because I'm hungry?" </seg>
<seg id="173">"You're going to kill me because I'm hungry?" is what this Venezuelan man was saying. </seg>
<seg id="174">We're tired. </seg>
<seg id="175">Stop screwing us. #AMirafloresHoy #LaTomaDeVenezuela </seg>
<seg id="176">Images of confrontations and reports of abuse and repression spread across Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="177">One of the most shared stories was of police heavy-handedness in the northern city of Maracay. </seg>
<seg id="178">There protesters say they took refuge inside the city's cathedral to escape police and other armed, pro-government groups. </seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later the demonstrators were able to get out to safety, but the protests continued. </seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators attempted to stop the advance of police, like this woman in the Andean state of Táchira: </seg>
<seg id="181">#LaTomaDeVenezuela Women in #Tachira don't wear skirts because you'd be able to see what many National Guards don't have! </seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic totalling the day's repression circulated on social media: </seg>
<seg id="183">How the dictatorship suppressed the interior of the country. </seg>
<seg id="184">For many, the presence of large numbers of people on the streets reinforces the legitimacy of the recall request, something government representatives have been attempting to undermine. </seg>
<seg id="185">As Myteks Media Labs puts it: </seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado say that 1% of signatures are false. </seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your recall! </seg>
<seg id="188">On the streets #LaTomaDeVenezuelapic.twitter.com/iojnCb7Kck </seg>
<seg id="189">Independent media such as Efecto Cocuyo and Prodavinci regularly share information, images and clips that demonstrate the size &#8212; and volume &#8212; of opposition to the Maduro administration. </seg>
<seg id="190">This is what #LaTomaDeVenezuela looked like on the Francisco Farjado motorway in Caracas </seg>
<seg id="191">The planned strike on October 27, however, attracted smaller numbers. </seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans told media they were too hungry to participate in a strike that involved not working and not shopping. </seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview with Luis Quijano by Alejo Gómez that originally appeared on August 23, 2016 in Día a Día. </seg>
<seg id="198">It was translated and published here with permission. </seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano’s father forced him to witness the horrors of La Perla, a clandestine detention center in the city of Córdoba, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="200">Now an adult, Luis testified against his father in the La Perla-Ribera mega trial in the province of Córdoba for crimes committed during the dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="201">Forty-three oppressors were charged with crimes against humanity in the trial, which concluded on August 24, 2016. </seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano didn’t choose his life. </seg>
<seg id="203">From the burden of having the same name as his father, to being exposed to brutal military operations in La Perla when he was 15, he had suffered long enough. </seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years. </seg>
<seg id="205">At the time, in that context I thought it was okay. </seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent. </seg>
<seg id="207">But at the age of 15, a child doesn’t realize that he’s being manipulated by his father. </seg>
<seg id="208">I was not prepared yet to understand that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer. </seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father was Gendarmerie Officer Luis Alberto Quijano, second in command of the Intelligence Detachment 141 at La Perla from 1976 to 1978, during the Argentine military dictatorship, a period of state terrorism in Argentina from roughly 1974 to 1983. </seg>

<seg id="213">It is the story of Luis Quijano’s son, a man who over the years learned the magnitude of the terror he had lived as boy and ultimately testified against his own father in federal court. </seg>
<seg id="214">It is a story that reflects the immense power that a parent has over a child, and how that child can choose a path of redemption. </seg>
<seg id="215">From the gym to the Detachment </seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started taking me to the Detachment, I had been going to the provincial gym and became friends with a boy who did martial arts. </seg>
<seg id="217">They called him “Kent.” </seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo card and asked me to identify my friend. </seg>
<seg id="219">He said: </seg>
<seg id="220">You’re an asshole, you made friends with an ERP! </seg>
<seg id="221">Watch, later they’ll kidnap you and I’ll have to save you. </seg>
<seg id="222">The ERP stands for the People's Revolutionary Army, which was the military branch of the communist Workers' Revolutionary Party in Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="223">So he forbid me to go back to the gym, and a few days later he took me to the Detachment to work. </seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I was going to be a secret agent. </seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15, and in that context I believed it was okay because it was what my father had taught me. </seg>
<seg id="226">At the Detachment, they made me destroy documentation that belonged to the prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="227">Documents of all kinds: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda, books, everything. </seg>

<seg id="229">'Over there is where they torture the prisoners' </seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me to La Perla four times, all in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="231">The first and fourth visits, he left me waiting in the car at the entrance. </seg>
<seg id="232">The second time he made me get out and he took me to a shed where there were cars, furniture, televisions, refrigerators, anything you could imagine. </seg>
<seg id="233">All of it stolen. </seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a package wrapped in a blanket and told me to take it to his car, and when I opened it, I saw it was a giant lump of silver. </seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other side of the shed where they dropped off the stolen things and I started chatting with a gendarme who was standing guard. </seg>
<seg id="236">At one point he gestured to an open room and told me: </seg>
<seg id="237">Over there is where they torture the prisoners. </seg>
<seg id="238">I peeked in and saw a bed where they tortured people. </seg>
<seg id="239">It was like a military cot with metal springs. </seg>
<seg id="240">Later I learned that they hooked up a stripped negative cable to the metal and used another positive cable to touch the body of whomever was tied down. </seg>
<seg id="241">They would handcuff a person on the cot, drench them with water and apply 220 volts to their genitals. </seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria </seg>
<seg id="243">There was such an appalling odor in there… like a dirty diaper. </seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was being held under house arrest, the same smell emanated from his room. </seg>
<seg id="245">I made the connection and realized that it’s the smell of a body in distress. </seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget that smell. </seg>
<seg id="247">And I wondered, how is it possible someone could do so much damage to another human being? </seg>
<seg id="248">'I had full knowledge that they killed those people' </seg>
<seg id="249">The third time my father brought me along to his work, he took me to the entrance of La Cuadra (the area where prisoners were handcuffed and blindfolded). </seg>
<seg id="250">He was talking to “Chubi” Lopez (Jose López, a civilian prosecuted in the trial) and I took advantage of the opportunity and looked inside La Cuadra. </seg>
<seg id="251">In the back I saw a row of mattresses with naked people lying face down, all were tied at the hands and feet. </seg>
<seg id="252">Closer to the entrance, there were other people sitting silently squatting on mattresses. </seg>
<seg id="253">My father saw that I was looking at the prisoners and said: “What you looking at, asshole?” </seg>
<seg id="254">And I said, "Well, why did you bring me here?” </seg>
<seg id="255">I had full knowledge that they killed those people. </seg>
<seg id="256">They threw them in a pit and military personnel shot them and buried them. </seg>
<seg id="257">I know because my father talked about it at home. </seg>
<seg id="258">Next to La Cuadra there were some rooms they called offices. </seg>
<seg id="259">I know that “Palito” Romero beat someone badly there and killed him. </seg>
<seg id="260">(According to survivors, civilian Jorge Romero, who was indicted in the La Perla-Ribera trial, beat student Raúl Mateo Molina to death). </seg>
<seg id="261">In the video below, Emilio Fessia, director of the Space for the Memory at La Perla, gives a tour of the former torture site. </seg>
<seg id="262">The road in which you came in and the route was the one in which the kidnapped people entered. </seg>
<seg id="263">If you look at the map, more or less they took this path and were taken to their first torture session. </seg>
<seg id="264">Here's where their names were changed and a number was assigned as part of the dehumanization process. </seg>
<seg id="265">If they survived the torture sessions, the disappeared detainees were thrown in the cuadra until an order came from the higher officers that they should be moved. </seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie, the euphemism they used for shooting and disappearing their bodies in most cases. </seg>
<seg id="267">The 'spoils of war' </seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all kinds of stolen goods. </seg>
<seg id="269">But, at that age, I had no idea what was meant by “spoils of war,” as they called it. </seg>
<seg id="270">But later when I was in the military (I was in the gendarmerie), I realized spoils of war would be a bayonet or maybe a military patch that you took from some enemy you had fought. </seg>
<seg id="271">Luis Alberto Quijano and son. </seg>
<seg id="272">Archive photo </seg>
<seg id="273">But if you walk into a house and steal the refrigerator, the record-player, clothing, paintings, money…those aren’t spoils of war, it’s vandalism. </seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft. </seg>
<seg id="275">I always wondered how my father, the chief officer of a security force, could participate in such vandalism. </seg>
<seg id="276">I don’t understand it. </seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and it never occurred to me to enter a house and steal everything. </seg>
<seg id="278">I do not understand how my father did that. </seg>
<seg id="279">Once he told me that I was a criminal, and I replied: And you, who steals cars off the street? </seg>
<seg id="280">You’re not a criminal? </seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded in a fit of rage, hit me and yelled: </seg>
<seg id="282">The day you cross that line, on that day I’ll find you and I’ll kill you myself. </seg>
<seg id="283">No need for someone else to do it! </seg>
<seg id="284">That was my father. </seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memories of him. </seg>
<seg id="286">When I testified in the trial, I showed a photograph from back then where I was wearing a jacket and a wool turtleneck my father had taken from La Perla. </seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he brought home clothes just the same. </seg>
<seg id="288">At the time, the defense accused me of being a co-conspirator in those crimes, and I said no problem, they could accuse me of whatever they wanted. </seg>
<seg id="289">I was there to testify anyway. </seg>
<seg id="290">'To disappear the body is the final, odious act' </seg>
<seg id="291">Now that I’m older I feel remorseful. </seg>
<seg id="292">I have children; once you have children you realize the value of a life. </seg>
<seg id="293">You evolve and understand that killing is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far as to say: </seg>
<seg id="295">Fine, suppose you executed people during the dictatorship, but why disappear the bodies? </seg>
<seg id="296">Why did you steal children? </seg>
<seg id="297">My father had once brought home a girl whose mother they killed. </seg>
<seg id="298">It was like a pet: almost like a dog, only it was a little girl. </seg>
<seg id="299">Those thoughts kept going through my head: They were tortured, but why were they killed? </seg>
<seg id="300">They could have just put them in jail. </seg>
<seg id="301">I guess they decided to kill them, but why disappear the bodies? </seg>
<seg id="302">Didn’t those people have families to claim their remains? </seg>
<seg id="303">To disappear the body is the final odious act to do to a human being. </seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me that when democracy returned they brought in machines to remove the remains, they ground them up and dumped them, I don’t know where. </seg>
<seg id="305">“They’re never going to find anything,” my father said. </seg>
<seg id="306">But of course something always remains. </seg>
<seg id="307">'I’ve seen you kill people!' </seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify, I have nothing against the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="309">In fact, I was a member of the gendarmerie. </seg>
<seg id="310">All I did was tell the truth about 20 criminals, including my father. </seg>
<seg id="311">The complaint against my father developed while talking to him when he was under house arrest. </seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for making me live through such atrocities. </seg>
<seg id="313">At one point he said: “I don’t know, I didn’t kill anyone.” </seg>
<seg id="314">I felt repulsed inside, I wondered what all that jingoism and all that “Western and Christian sentiment” that they claimed to be defending was for. </seg>
<seg id="315">Then I shouted: </seg>
<seg id="316">How can you say that to me? </seg>
<seg id="317">I’ve seen you kill people! </seg>
<seg id="318">You committed very serious crimes, you made me participate in those crimes as a child. </seg>
<seg id="319">And he said, “Well, go denounce me then." </seg>
<seg id="320">And so I did. </seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I filed the first complaint. </seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized he was a criminal. </seg>
<seg id="323">No one can tell me I’m biased, I testified against my own father. </seg>

<seg id="344">The botched translation displayed at a driver's license renewal center in Kyoto. </seg>
<seg id="345">From image widely shared on social media. </seg>
<seg id="346">Modified from original photo by Joshua Levine. </seg>
<seg id="347">A notice board displayed at the newly opened Kyoto Driver's License Renewal Center last month featured a rather unfortunate mistranslation. </seg>
<seg id="348">The Japanese word 高齢運転者 (koreiuntensha), meaning "senior driver", was incorrectly &#8212; and perhaps mischievously &#8212; translated as "terrible driver". </seg>
<seg id="349">The mistranslation was displayed on electronic noticeboards both at the entrance to and inside the center from September 1-20. </seg>
<seg id="350">Modified from original photo by Joshua Levine, widely shared on social media. </seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was pointed out by translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyoto, who contacted the local newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun reported: </seg>
<seg id="353">"Why has the English translation ended up like this? </seg>
<seg id="354">It's just proof that nobody checked it. </seg>
<seg id="355">This is offensive to elderly people and unacceptable coming from an international city like Kyoto," said Mr. Holmes. </seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English was initially removed, and the phrase "terrible drivers" later replaced with the more appropriate, if not quite grammatically accurate "elder drivers". </seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto Prefectural Police apologised for the error, explaining that the mistake was present in the translation when it was received from the contractor, and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before being put on display. </seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apology: </seg>
<seg id="359">"We are sincerely sorry to have caused offence to the elderly due to our insufficient verification (of the translation)", said the police. </seg>
<seg id="360">However, online news service J-Cast News provided a bit of context about just how "terrible" the phenomenon of older drivers might be in Japan, noting: </seg>
<seg id="361">While the term "awful" was decried as an inappropriate way to describe elderly drivers, according to police, nationally the rate of senior citizens involved in accidents is cause for alarm. </seg>
<seg id="362">For example, in Kyoto Prefecture senior citizens were determined to be at fault in 1,941 of 19,460 accidents that occurred in 2005—a rate of about 10%. </seg>
<seg id="363">A decade later, in 2014, seniors were at fault in 1,803 of 11,850 accidents. </seg>
<seg id="364">So the rate increased to 17.7%. </seg>
<seg id="365">While the total number of accidents has declined, the rate of seniors determined to be at fault in these accidents has increased. </seg>
<seg id="366">The unnamed reporter also dredged up a variety of comments on the Yahoo version of the article that demonstrates the bias against older drivers potentially held by some Japanese people: </seg>
<seg id="367">The Yahoo article that reports on the mistranslation features comments like these: </seg>
<seg id="368">- "Isn't it ("terrible drivers") just the reality?" </seg>
<seg id="369">- "The mistranslation is not totally incorrect, right?" </seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think this is totally a mistranslation." </seg>
<seg id="371">There are a bunch of comments like this. </seg>
<seg id="372">Why "Engrish" continues to prevail across Asia </seg>
<seg id="373">Mistranslations are all too common in Japan, and throughout Asia. </seg>
<seg id="374">The website Engrish.com is a gold mine of these bizarre misuses of the English language. </seg>
<seg id="375">Image from Flickr user Andrew. </seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for this prevalence of mistranslations are manifold. </seg>
<seg id="377">Translation requires two major skills: the passive language ability required to understand the source text, and the active language ability required to render it into the target language. </seg>
<seg id="378">As the second skill requires an active command of the target language &#8212; something generally possessed by native speakers &#8212; it is generally accepted that translators should be native speakers of the target language, not of the source language. </seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French speaker would undertake an English to French translation, but not a French to English translation. </seg>
<seg id="380">Image from Flickr user Karl Baron. </seg>
<seg id="381">Whether due to a lack of understanding about translation, cost restrictions, or the relatively small number of native English speakers who learn Japanese, many Japanese companies do not employ native English speakers for translations into English. </seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies with no foreign staff translate in house, assigning the task to the Japanese staff member perceived as having the highest level of English ability—no matter how limited this may be. </seg>
<seg id="383">Image from Flickr user Karl Baron. </seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also commonly used, to often amusing results. </seg>
<seg id="385">The convoluted and cryptic phrases produced by machine translation prove that this technology is a long way off replacing human translators, particularly across some languages. </seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English in Japan, including the puzzling phrases that often adorn T-shirts and bags, is used for purely stylistic purposes, and is not intended to be read or understood. </seg>
<seg id="387">Image from Flickr user Joseph Brent. </seg>
<seg id="388">While acceptable, or at least harmless, when used for decoration, mistranslations are not something that should be expected from major corporations and the government, which should have the resources needed to maintain higher standards. </seg>
<seg id="389">Hopefully Kyoto City will get its translations from a more reputable source in the future. </seg>
<seg id="390">As Protests Escalate, Web TV and News Sites Are Censored in Venezuela &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="391">Homepage for IPYS "Navegar con Libertad" (browse freely) portal. </seg>
<seg id="392">On the morning of April 7, Venezuelan netizens reported that they were unable to access the web TV channel Vivoplay from inside the country. </seg>
<seg id="393">Others have since reported that VPITV and El Capitolio TV have also been inaccessible. </seg>
<seg id="394">These and other web TV channels had been broadcasting protests in Caracas, which were organized by those opposing Nicolás Maduro's administration. </seg>
<seg id="395">The demonstrations unfolded last week after the country's Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and reassigned its functions to the executive branch and the Supreme Court itself. </seg>
<seg id="396">Journalist and Global Voices author Luis Carlos Díaz posted the results of a traceroute test, indicating that the connection timed out and recommending users activate VPNs (virtual private networks) in order to connect. </seg>
<seg id="397">Turn on your VPNs. </seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that website blocking on Venezuelan ISPs is back. </seg>
<seg id="399">This is from @VivoPlayNet's website. </seg>
<seg id="400">Services like Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans who have Internet access, particularly in times of unrest. </seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional outlets have been reluctant to cover protests since 2014, when the Telecommunications Commission threatened to fine them and shut them down for covering demonstrations, an act that what the Commission characterized as “an incitement to violence.” </seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and without national channels informing, I resumed my account in @vivoplaynet. </seg>
<seg id="403">I'm surprised it's still cheaper than two liters of soda. </seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay, but two other online TV channels, including the streaming site used by the National Assembly to broadcast their sessions, are inaccessible due to domain name system (DNS) blocking. </seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), digital rights research group in Venezuela, has proven that local Internet service providers sometimes use DNS blocking, a technique through which domain name servers respond incorrectly to requests for a particular domain. </seg>
<seg id="406">When a website is blocked via DNS, the server will reply incorrectly or will deny the request when that website is called upon. </seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm DNS blocking: @elcapitoliotv @VPITV and @vivoplaynet </seg>
<seg id="408">The third channel that is now blocked, VPITV, had seen their streaming cut yesterday when the police arrested VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who was streaming live from the protests in Caracas. </seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while in police custody. </seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later and VPITV’s streaming resumed. </seg>
<seg id="411">While some of these site's broadcasts are still available via YouTube, there are also reports that the government is throttling Internet connections, making it difficult for Venezuelans to obtain multimedia coverage as events unfold in the country. </seg>

<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga, who was a criadita in her childhood, visits the house that she worked in for years. </seg>
<seg id="414">Currently, Tina works to defend the rights of children and gathers testimonies of criaditas who, like her, were victims of abuse and discrimination. </seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas, published with permission from Kurtural. </seg>
<seg id="416">This post is a shortened version of the article written by Kurtural and is published on Global Voices with permission from its authors. </seg>
<seg id="417">Likewise, the text forms part of the series, "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que caen” (“Cows that Fly, Schools that Crumble“), which will likewise be republished and re-edited by Global Voices Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a house where she was forbidden to eat with the household family. </seg>
<seg id="419">Nearly a college graduate, she returned years later and listened to the mistress talk about her with pride. </seg>
<seg id="420">"She is like our daughter, the one who has turned out better," she said. </seg>
<seg id="421">But Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in that house. </seg>
<seg id="422">Starting when she was ten years old, she was the family's criadita, a word used in Paraguay to describe the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work in order to be able to attend school. </seg>
<seg id="423">The deal is simple: a large family with little money hands over their underage son or daughter to another more wealthy family, in exchange for the child receiving food, education, and a roof over their head. </seg>
<seg id="424">What is not said is that the boy or girl will have endless days of domestic work, work that is never paid, and may suffer abuse or mistreatment, all under a contract that cannot be annulled. </seg>
<seg id="425">This is known as criadazgo, a prevailing practice within Paraguay due to the complicit acceptance by a good chunk of society and despite various complaints from human rights organizations. </seg>
<seg id="426">After finishing her undergraduate studies, Alvarenga worked for years for an organization that defends the rights of boys and girls. </seg>
<seg id="427">She interviewed criaditas (young girls trapped in criadazgo), gathered testimonies, researched and denounced. </seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things as they are, because the feeling of gratitude instilled in criaditas is, in general, a guarantee of silence. </seg>
<seg id="429">"Criadazgo is supported by a double illusion," says Alvarenga. </seg>
<seg id="430">On one hand, there is the illusion of the family that delivers their daughter over to another family, thinking that, thanks to this act, she will be able to finish her studies, better her social position, and "be someone in life". </seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that receives the daughter justifies her exploitation by believing that they are giving an opportunity to someone who otherwise would not be able to study and even might have starved to death. </seg>
<seg id="432">Victims of criadazgo </seg>
<seg id="433">If the girl is mistreated, her family members will not know of it until many years afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes, they never find out. </seg>
<seg id="435">But in January of 2016, an event put a face to this hidden phenomenon that happens within the houses of Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="436">Carolina Marín was admitted to Caaguazú's Regional Hospital with signs of having received a fierce beating and died soon afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old. </seg>
<seg id="438">She was a criadita in the house of former military man Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo, an official for the Civil Registry. </seg>
<seg id="439">Marín was living with them in Vaquería, a locality of little more than 3,000 inhabitants located some 250 kilometers east of Asunción. </seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira beat Marín with a branch until he killed her. </seg>
<seg id="441">It was the last punishment the teenager ever received. </seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media disseminated news of the incident. </seg>
<seg id="443">They emphasized how the murdered minor was a criadita. </seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations, such as UNICEF or Callescuela, blamed the death on the unshakable tradition of criadazgo. </seg>
<seg id="445">They called it "a modern form of slavery". </seg>
<seg id="446">Dozens of people gathered together in protests, demanding that there not be "another Carolina" in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="447">The teenager's name and photos went viral via social media. </seg>
<seg id="448">"In Paraguay, there are more registered cows than children," complained Tina Alvarenga. </seg>
<seg id="449">Without identification, it is easier to violate children's rights with impunity. </seg>
<seg id="450">Without such records, it is difficult to control the conditions in which a boy or girl lives. </seg>
<seg id="451">The couple’s neighbors, along with almost 60 civil society organizations, are calling for swiftness in the investigation of the case. </seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomár Ferreira and Ramona Megarejo to serve 30 years in prison for the homicide of the girl who was their criadita. </seg>
<seg id="453">If the legal process continues, the case of Carolina Marín could become a landmark one — the first time that criadazgo is judged in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="454">The routine </seg>
<seg id="455">In addition to labor exploitation, many criaditas also live isolated from other girls their age. </seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the factory where her father worked went bankrupt, leaving him unemployed. </seg>
<seg id="457">All of her brothers were put to work in order to bring money into the house, selling sweets in the streets or in the market. </seg>
<seg id="458">All of them continued studying at school. </seg>
<seg id="459">Only she became a criadita in Asunción. </seg>
<seg id="460">In her employers' house, Alvarenga worked between four to six hours each day, and also had to measure the amount of time that she had to dedicate to studying. </seg>
<seg id="461">She woke up around five in the morning and prepared breakfast for her patrons, then began cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="462">Every day of the week had to be dedicated to cleaning and organizing a different part of the house. </seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, she cleaned the refrigerator and the living room, polishing the furniture and disinfecting the floor. </seg>
<seg id="464">Afterwards, she went to school. When school ended, she would return home and have time to study. </seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished studying, the more free time she would have; yet this also was limited, since she had to make dinner for her patrons. </seg>
<seg id="466">Alvarenga says that although she never went hungry, her food was limited. </seg>
<seg id="467">"I had more access to the master's library than to the refrigerator," she recalls. </seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-stocked and belonged to the owner of the house, a military sympathizer of the Liberal Party, the opposition party to the dictator Stroessner (who ruled between 1954 and 1989). </seg>
<seg id="469">Some nights, after dinner, the master would compel Alvarenga to stand by his side and read oppositor newspaper editorials such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo," and persuade her not to believe what the official media said regarding the dictator's regime. </seg>
<seg id="470">He considered her intelligent, but did not converse with her. </seg>
<seg id="471">"The master had found someone who would listen to him talk about politics," she says. </seg>
<seg id="472">"They did not let me go to my own home very often, because they said that I would return with 'the bad habit'." This was in reference to how she would speak in Guarani, her maternal tongue, since she is an indigenous Guarani. </seg>
<seg id="473">Her patrons feared, she explains, that she would lose the education that they had given her. </seg>
<seg id="474">All the same, she was perfectly aware that all that they provided for her was paid for by her own hard work. </seg>
<seg id="475">Discrimination against Alvarenga carried over into school as well. "One of the things that is least spoken of is bullying, of the harassment that criaditas suffer when they go to school. </seg>
<seg id="476">Since other children have parents, they immediately realize that if you don't have them, then you are a criadita. </seg>
<seg id="477">"I couldn't invite anyone over to the house where I was living, I didn't have my own group of friends at school or among my neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="478">In my adolescence, which is when friendships are formed, what I felt most keenly was that I didn't belong to a group. </seg>
<seg id="479">Of everything, the isolation was the worst part," Alvarenga explains. </seg>
<seg id="480">A system endorsed by society </seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published this text in a Facebook group where people share employment advertisements for professional cleaners and nannies in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="482">The group administrator is Pepa Kostianovsky, a city councilwoman for Asunción Municipality. </seg>
<seg id="483">Hello, I need a little companion for my darling, to play with her in the morning and in the afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="484">In order to study. </seg>
<seg id="485">Please notify. </seg>
<seg id="486">By Monday if it's possible. </seg>
<seg id="487">The announcement received five "Likes" and various comments. </seg>
<seg id="488">One woman from the city of Ñemby said that she had an eleven-year old girl and gave her phone number. </seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman, also from Ñemby, offered her 15-year old niece. "She likes the little ones and is very pretty," she wrote. </seg>
<seg id="490">A third comment spoke of "an inland girl that wanted to work". </seg>
<seg id="491">In the midst of the number of replies, the author of the ad intervened: </seg>
<seg id="492">Friends, I found one, I am going to see if she works out. </seg>
<seg id="493">Many thanks, I will notify again if anything. </seg>
<seg id="494">The transaction was closed. </seg>
<seg id="495">Ortiz wrote in the prologue to Criaditas, ¿hasta cuándo? </seg>
<seg id="496">(Criaditas, Until When?), a collection of testimonies from ex-criaditas: </seg>
<seg id="497">If throughout our history we have been capable of ending systems like slavery, cuñadazgo (a practice in Paraguay's early history in which the Spanish conquistadores enslaved Guarani women as their "wives"), las encomiendas (in which Spanish citizens were rewarded with Paraguay natives, who would be forced to pay them tribute and undergo Spanish indoctrination), or the mensú (a laborer who was considered a semi-slave), it is unjustifiable that we continue to accept with pleasant complicity the servitude that faces so many girls and boys in a system of slavery, opening them up to all types of abuses and exploitation. </seg>
<seg id="498">Both Paraguay's social inequality and power show-off are clues to understanding the validity of this phenomenon known as criadazgo. </seg>
<seg id="499">Draft Law Would Require Egyptian Social Media Users to Register With Government &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="500">Image via Pixabay and altered by Global Voices. </seg>
<seg id="501">Released to public domain under CC0. </seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian members of parliament recently approved a draft law on "the regulations of using and exploiting social media networks." </seg>
<seg id="503">If adopted by the parliament, the law would require social media users in Egypt to register with a government authority in order to use social media websites including Facebook and Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="504">The law would establish a department tasked with granting citizens permission to use social media. </seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of the law's adoption, users would have to register on the department's website with their real names and state ID numbers to be able to use social media networks. </seg>
<seg id="506">Failure to do so could bring punishment of up to six months in jail and a fine. </seg>
<seg id="507">The six-article draft law, which was circulated by local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that works via the internet and is used to communicate with others via voice, video messages and text." </seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law would be enforced once adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities could impose registration on users or to detect those who do not register, give that the Egyptian government does not currently have the ability to regulate social media companies at this level. </seg>
<seg id="509">But the bill's sponsor MP Riyad Abdul Sattar told Al-Monitor that registered users will get a username and a password from the telecommunication ministry "to get through the firewall blocking Facebook." </seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to create a national-level firewall around Facebook, through which they could then require Egyptians to submit identity information in order to access the network. </seg>
<seg id="511">But no such plans are known to exist, as of yet. </seg>
<seg id="512">Local experts are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal. </seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, senior research technologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), told Global Voices: </seg>
<seg id="514">I highly doubt the technical capabilities and understanding of any authority in Egypt towards tech-related matters. </seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, the same way they think of controlling physical public and private spaces by force is how they imagine it could be done online. </seg>
<seg id="516">If I will take them seriously, this means they are going to deploy a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who apply for an approval or don't, and this means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also referring them to trial. </seg>
<seg id="517">It is not realistic at all technically &#8212; but in Egypt everything is possible </seg>
<seg id="518">To become law, the bill will first need to be discussed by the parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it is referred for plenary debate. </seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its adoption and enforcement are successful or not, the bill is "consistent with the pro-military mindset in the parliament that is set maximize control and make sure no different narrations are present on the scene," Raoof said. </seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed an anti-cyber-crime bill which would prescribe a life prison sentence for those convicted of "threatening public order" and "incitement to protest". </seg>

<seg id="525">High in the mountains of northeastern Iraq’s Kurdistan region, wildlife conservationist Hana Ahmed Raza and a team of researchers with the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghost-like Persian leopard. </seg>
<seg id="526">A sub-species of the broader family of leopards roaming across Africa and Asia, the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) numbers between 800 and 1,000 individuals, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and is under threat due to poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation, and diminishing prey. </seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular species of leopard so important? </seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza points out in the video, “The Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the ecosystem,” and the health of the ecosystem depends on the presence of large predators to thrive. </seg>
<seg id="529">The chances of actually seeing a Persian leopard in the wild are pretty much slim to nil, so when the team realizes in the video that they’ve captured an image of a big cat on a camera trap, Raza erupts with pure joy. </seg>
<seg id="530">A biologist by training Raza is passionate about showing another side of her country that isn’t just “war and conflict.” </seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in wildlife field surveys and educational outreach programs with Nature Iraq for the past six years. </seg>
<seg id="532">She has also been a member of the IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and has worked on efforts to establish protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdistan region. </seg>

<seg id="539">"View of Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi) from Shizugawa High School." </seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was devastated by a tsunami in March, 2011, and the region is still rebuilding. </seg>

<seg id="544">Earlier in March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo, a Japanese daily newspaper covering northeastern Japan, documented the progress that has been made over the past six years to reconstruct the lives of people affected by the March 2011 "triple disaster" of a massive earthquake, tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear accident. </seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo is headquartered in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, which was one of several prefectures in Japan's northeast that experienced both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people Miyagi and its neighbors Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate as the tsunami wiped entire coastal cities off the map. </seg>
<seg id="547">Fukushima Prefecture also experienced a nuclear accident that, alone, forced 160,000 residents to be evacuated from their homes. </seg>
<seg id="548">Six years on, the Kahoku Shimpo's special coverage provides a local perspective on what progress has been made rebuilding the lives of people living in the region. </seg>
<seg id="549">The newspaper's in-depth feature includes statistics from Japan's Reconstruction Ministry as well as surveys of evacuees themselves. </seg>
<seg id="550">The State of Housing in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate </seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo reports that as of December 2015, 77 per cent of planned replacement housing (災害公営住宅, saigai kouei juutaku) has been completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures. </seg>
<seg id="552">Of the three prefectures Miyagi has experienced the most success, with 80 per cent of planned replacement housing completed. </seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate Prefecture has completed 75 per cent of such housing, while Fukushima lags behind at 70 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years on there are still efforts to move evacuees from prefabricated temporary housing (仮設住宅, kasetsu juutaku) to permanent replacement housing. </seg>
<seg id="555">Following the triple disaster, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in temporary housing. </seg>
<seg id="556">As of December 2016, there were still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate living in such housing. </seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 per cent of 2011 evacuees from Fukushima still live in temporary housing, while Miyagi has been more successful; more than 75 per cent of evacuees residing in prefabricated housing post-disaster have been moved to permanent homes. </seg>
<seg id="558">With Iwate, the figure is 34 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="559">The State of Work and Day-to-Day Life in the Three Affected Prefectures </seg>
<seg id="560">The Kahoku Shimpo found that 1,074 of 1,100 (or nearly 98 per cent) of schools in three prefectures affected by the March 2011 disaster had been reopened by December 2016. </seg>
<seg id="561">Six years on, it's clear that rebuilding industry in the three prefectures has been more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="562">While close to 100 per cent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now operational, just 30 per cent of fishing ports have reopened in Fukushima. </seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident affected a large area of agricultural land in the three prefectures. </seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi has been able to rehabilitate 93 per cent of affected farmland, while just 66 per cent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of farmland affected by the disaster in Fukushima has returned to use. </seg>
<seg id="565">It's unlikely this is just because of the nuclear accident. Of 5,400 hectares of farmland in Fukushima affected by the disaster, 690 hectares lie within the "nuclear exclusion zone." </seg>
<seg id="566">Tourism has largely rebounded in two of the three prefectures, but, once again, Fukushima still lags. </seg>
<seg id="567">Tourist visitors to Iwate and Miyagi have returned to about 90 per cent of pre-disaster levels, while the number for Fukushima is just 75 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo also reports that nearly half of people in coastal settlements feel that earning a livelihood has gotten tougher since the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="569">Are Locals Prepared for the Next 'Big One'? </seg>
<seg id="570">The paper conducted numerous surveys of local residents and evacuees to determine everything from the state of reconstruction to how perceptions have changed about the risk of tsunamis. </seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to the feature, the Kahoku Shimpo explained: </seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about tsunami awareness among local residents. </seg>
<seg id="573">The survey found that 83.1 per cent of local residents had taken steps to prepare for a future earthquake and tsunami. </seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 per cent of respondents (more than half) still feel not enough has been done to prepare for the next disaster. </seg>
<seg id="575">How Evacuees from Fukushima Prefectural Are Faring </seg>
<seg id="576">In its anniversary coverage, the Kahoku Shimpo also paid special attention to the status of evacuees from Fukushima Prefecture. </seg>
<seg id="577">Besides experiencing the powerful earthquake and devastating tsunami, Fukushima Prefecture also witnessed Japan's worst nuclear accident as a result of the disaster. </seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63,000 people were evacuated outside of the prefecture itself. </seg>
<seg id="579">By early 2016, a little more than 23,000 people had been relocated to permanent replacement housing back within Fukushima. </seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, approximately 40,000 Fukushima citizens still reside outside of their home prefecture. </seg>
<seg id="581">The majority of evacuees from all areas affected by the disaster who are still living in temporary shelter are over the age of 50, and it's thought one obstacle to moving them back into proper housing is that efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima prefectures are competing against massive construction projects that are part of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. </seg>

<seg id="583">When you first encounter people who come from countries or who speak languages that aren't your own, you might think that your differences are greater than your similarities. </seg>
<seg id="584">But spend a little time together, and you'll start to see that you have more in common than you first thought. </seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they challenge our beliefs, they broaden our perspective, and they remind us that it might just be a small world after all. </seg>
<seg id="586">In this edition of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast where we take a closer look at one topic that isn’t getting the media coverage it deserves, we are digging deep into global connections. </seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices contributors who recall a moment in which they felt connected to someone across borders and across language. </seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a hiking trip cemented her affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa remembers how a love of music overcame a lack of a shared language while traveling in rural China; Adriana Macias speaks about her time working with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experience living in a small village in Madagascar. </seg>

<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva in a widely circulated photo. </seg>
<seg id="595">A 33-year-old Brazilian student is hospitalized in intensive care this week, after a police officer hit him in the head with a baton during a demonstration in the city of Goiânia last Friday, when millions of people joined a nationwide strike against austerity reforms. </seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, sustained a traumatic brain injury and multiple fractures. </seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him this Saturday, and he's now in an induced coma. </seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical. . </seg>
<seg id="599">Local photojournalist Luiz da Luz captured the assault on film, and his footage has spread rapidly throughout Brazil over the past few days. </seg>
<seg id="600">The images also reveal the face of the officer wielding the club: a man who has since been identified as Captain Augusto Sampaio. </seg>
<seg id="601">Following the incident, military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio has been suspended from active duty, pending the results of an investigation. </seg>
<seg id="602">The sequence of photos shows that the military police officer broke his baton on the face of student Matheus Ferreira in Goiânia (photos: Luiz da Luz). </seg>
<seg id="603">If a police were in intensive care after being beaten by a protester, his face would be on TV for six months and all repression would be justified. </seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page “Desneuralizador", an outlet of media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz, showing the moments after Mateus was clubbed in the head, as paramedics tended to him. </seg>
<seg id="605">Another video showing the same moment from another angle have also appeared on social media. </seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip below, the beating occurs at 00:50. </seg>
<seg id="607">Internet users have already crowdfunded 10,000 Brazilian reais ($3,150) for Mateus' family, who lives in another state, to cover some of his medical expenses and to house his relatives in Goiânia, while he's hospitalized. </seg>

<seg id="611">Author: Heitor Vilela, published with permission </seg>
<seg id="612">Writing on Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado remembered other episodes of violence against activists in Goiás: </seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a surge of political violence: It was there that the activist Guilherme Irish was murdered by his father to support the Occupy Movement in secondary schools; it was there that the military police joined a WhatsApp group meant to criminalize teachers; it was there that an occupied school was sabotaged with a gas leak; and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, in intensive care after being assaulted in the head with a baton by a police officer. </seg>
<seg id="614">Police crackdown </seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where police cracked down brutally on demonstrators last Friday. </seg>
<seg id="616">In Rio de Janeiro, riot police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protests in the city's center, where demonstrators had erected a stage for speakers. </seg>
<seg id="617">Speaking through a loudspeaker, state deputy Flavio Serafini, from Brazil's Socialist and Freedom Party (PSOL), pleaded with police to refrain from violence against the protesters. </seg>
<seg id="618">As Serafini spoke, police launched a tear gas canister at the stage, hitting the person who filmed the video blow: </seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian press chose to cover street protests by focusing on this incredible protagonist: the glass pane. </seg>
<seg id="620">Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo chose a photo of a glass window being broken to illustrate their front pages. </seg>
<seg id="621">O Globo on the other hand favored a photo of a bus set on fire. </seg>
<seg id="622">There isn't a journalistically plausible reason to justify a broken glass window receiving more coverage than the gathering of thousands of people on a square to defend a cause. </seg>
<seg id="623">You could keep being radically against any scratch on any material property and, still, acknowledge this fact. </seg>
<seg id="624">Again, the term "vandalism" receives an absurdly disproportional emphasis and the typical acts of violence by the military police are covered as "demonstrators enter confrontation against the PM." </seg>
<seg id="625">The Ghost Towns Left Behind by Cuba's Shuttered Sugar Mills &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="626">After the closing of the mills "about 272 employees had to reinvent themselves. Some changed jobs. Others traveled daily to mills that continued grinding." Photo by Julio Batista for Periodismo de Barrio, used with permission. </seg>
<seg id="627">The people's council of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, in the western province of Mayabeque, is better known as el Central, which means sugar mill in Cuban Spanish. </seg>
<seg id="628">However, sugar harvest isn’t talked about there anymore. </seg>
<seg id="629">Twelve years ago, production at the mill was halted, and then came the dismantling. Piece by piece, the mill was taken apart until there was nothing more than steel infrastructure and concrete. </seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 employees had to reinvent themselves. </seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed jobs. </seg>
<seg id="632">Others traveled daily to mills that continued grinding. </seg>
<seg id="633">The sugar harvest doesn't worry Nene, an old welder who still gets up everyday at 4 in the morning. He doesn't lose any sleep over the sugar harvest. </seg>
<seg id="634">But then he heard that there were mills in the east that had begun grinding again after a lot of inactivity. They had apparently been maintained. </seg>
<seg id="635">That did keep him awake that night. </seg>
<seg id="636">In Mañalich, Nene remembers perfectly, they said they’d maintain the mill, but they didn't. </seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar industry in Cuba has encountered many merciless hurdles: the collapse of the socialist block, low market values, inefficiencies, bad administrative decisions and climate change. </seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production was at 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than what was being produced back in 1910. </seg>
<seg id="639">That kind of news would have shocked the nation decades ago, but the failure of the sugar cane harvest is no longer a concern in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the sugar cane industry dismantled? </seg>
<seg id="641">The old way station on the sugar mill property has seen its best days. </seg>
<seg id="642">Photo: Julio Batista. </seg>
<seg id="643">The downsizing of the sugarcane industry was an economic necessity: the total of 155 mills—which were technologically behind and uncompetitive—was unsustainable for the country. </seg>
<seg id="644">The initial approach was to consolidate the production efficiently, with a cap of 4 million tons a year. </seg>
<seg id="645">Only the factories capable of producing sugar at a cost of 4 cents a pound or less would remain. </seg>
<seg id="646">And the solution to the unemployment that came as a result: going back to school. </seg>
<seg id="647">The motives to take such measures were the low productivity of sugarcane fields and the slump on sugar in the global market. </seg>
<seg id="648">However, the price of sugar began to improve over a decade ago. </seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 through 2025, the price of unrefined sugar is expected to level off between 15 and 16 cents per pound, according to the 2016 edition of the “Agricultural Perspectives" from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). </seg>
<seg id="650">Had production in 2001 been maintained (3.6 million tons), about 815 million dollars would have been made from the export of unrefined sugar. </seg>
<seg id="651">Things weren't going so well </seg>
<seg id="652">“Today will surely become a historic day" were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at Lavandero mill. </seg>
<seg id="653">So began the restructuring of the sugar industry. </seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 mills would be closed down and more than 65,000 people would receive their full salary for going back to school. </seg>
<seg id="655">The Gregorio Arleé Mañalich mill's turn would arrive on May 14, 2004. </seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez (or Nene, as everyone calls him) had worked there since 1967. </seg>
<seg id="657">When he speaks of the closing of the sugar mill, the word he repeats the most is "deception." </seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all the interviewees agree: They were never told that the mill would be dismantled. </seg>
<seg id="659">A team stayed on to work full-time on preserving the place. </seg>
<seg id="660">But before the first year was up, letters began to arrive. </seg>
<seg id="661">They were formulaic documents in which the only things that changed were the names of the pieces to be extracted, the recipient and the date. </seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by the Cuban minister of sugar at the time, Ulises Rosales del Toro. Only the minister could authorize each extraction. </seg>
<seg id="663">Further responsibilities would be delegated afterwards, however, and the letters would arrive more frequently. </seg>
<seg id="664">For two years, Juan Carlos Rivero was head of the Closed Factory (the official name given to mills and agro-industrial complexes that had to be closed down) and amongst those who received the letters. </seg>
<seg id="665">"The country had neither money to buy supplies, nor spare parts for the factories that were functioning," he assures. </seg>
<seg id="666">Eddy Reyes, 64, is waiting to reach the retirement age at another mill, the Bouris Luis Santa Coloma. </seg>
<seg id="667">Against his will, he had to dismember the installations he had put in place before. </seg>
<seg id="668">With each piece he stripped, he was dismantling 31 years of his own life. </seg>
<seg id="669">The direct legacy of closing a hundred sugar mills has been a string of communities with engineers and technicians that, suddenly, didn't have any factories to help operate or repair. The best distributed industrial branch of Cuba and the oldest employment source in the nation were eliminated; and in many ways, no alternatives were created for those lost jobs or for the services in the communities where the mills were located. </seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during his lengthy inauguration speech on October 21, 2002, the Cuban president looked in the faces of those who were listening to him when he guaranteed that everything was going well in the factories that had stopped grinding five years prior. </seg>
<seg id="671">The impact of closing the sugar mills on people </seg>
<seg id="672">After 2004, in Mañalich, the only place that processes sugar cane are "guaraperas": small places where the sugar cane is squeezed to make juice. </seg>

<seg id="674">Two years later, the people's council of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich would realize that, when a mill closes, a lot of things change, but almost never for the better. </seg>
<seg id="675">When the mill closed, or rather, when it was destroyed, they also stopped paving highways and thus, services declined. </seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the town and too old to study, Nene and Eddy had to go work for other mills. </seg>
<seg id="677">They became replacement parts. </seg>
<seg id="678">Without a hopeful future in their isolated town, many other young people finally left too. </seg>
<seg id="679">In the small neighborhood surrounding the sugar mill, a pasta factory was built, but it couldn't even produce enough noodles to feed the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="680">The scraps of the sugar mill that remained at the base of the new establishment remained untouched, imposing. </seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene returned from the Boris Luis Santa Coloma mill to the ruins of the place where he had started working. </seg>
<seg id="682">Forty-nine sugar harvests allowed him to settle in Mañalich with more than 2,000 pesos. </seg>
<seg id="683">Nene &#8212; black, short, with few teeth and a clear voice &#8212; is not a spiteful man, but he will never forgive them for lying to him. </seg>
<seg id="684">The distress has consumed him over the last decade. </seg>
<seg id="685">He retired at 65. </seg>
<seg id="686">But it wasn't because he lacked strength; rather, because he was bitter. </seg>

<seg id="689">Among First Nations Youth, Hip-Hop Is a Tool for Self-Expression and Cultural Preservation &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="690">Recording session for the "Home to Me" song - Grassy Narrows First Nation. </seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission from N'we Jinan. </seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from First Nations communities across Canada are reflecting on issues that are important to them through hip-hop, thanks to a series of travelling workshops. </seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N’we Jinan tour, workshops leaders have been taking mobile music studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach songwriting, recording, audio and video production, and live performance to youth groups since 2014. </seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by David Hodges, a Montreal-based educator, who worked with 10 Cree communities in Northern Quebec, and later started to collaborate with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars. </seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop model starts off with conversations with the young attendees to explore topics such as “cultural identity, language, struggle, love, self-acceptance,” or whatever else is on their mind. </seg>
<seg id="696">They then use these issues as inspiration for songs and videos, with the youth in starring roles. </seg>
<seg id="697">Due to the workshops’ popularity, the team also has been working with other First Nations communities in British Columbia, and was invited to organize a similar workshop with the Winnebago tribe of Nebraska in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video from the 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo School in Kitsumkalum First Nation, British Columbia, tells the story of the Highway 16 or the “Highway of Tears,” a stretch of road in Western Canada where almost two dozen young women, mostly indigenous, have disappeared or have been murdered. </seg>
<seg id="699">The cases mostly remain unsolved. </seg>
<seg id="700">This next video from Nemaska Cree First Nation uses a video game theme to communicate the importance of maintaining traditional customs and practices despite globalization’s influences. </seg>
<seg id="701">And while there are varying degrees of First Nations language fluency among the youth that participate, many of the song titles are in the native language. </seg>
<seg id="702">In this song recorded in Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation, the song's chorus is sung in the Cree language. </seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hip group, who lent them a verse in Eastern James Bay Cree. </seg>
<seg id="704">On the N'we Jinan Facebook Page, a transcription of the verse was provided, along with the English-language translation: </seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no ever cares about me, </seg>
<seg id="706">but I’m still going to try to continue to walk my days on earth </seg>
<seg id="707">this is the day you’ll hear our scream, </seg>
<seg id="708">cause we lost our way in life as youth </seg>
<seg id="709">but I believe that one day we will rise </seg>
<seg id="710">I don’t want to see them live a bad life </seg>
<seg id="711">so they can grow and lead our youth as well </seg>
<seg id="712">so they can do as the creator destined them to </seg>
<seg id="713">Within the same comments section, reader and Cree-language advocate Kevin Brousseau also made a contribution of the transcription of the verse using the syllabics writing system (also published on his blog and republished with permission): </seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, plastic models of food are common outside of just about every eatery. </seg>
<seg id="719">In order to provide potential customers with information about exactly what's on the menu, shokuhin sanpuru (食品サンプル, "food samples"), or highly detailed replicas of every dish served in the restaurant, are displayed near the entrance. </seg>
<seg id="720">Customers peruse the food samples, and then decide to enter the shop or keep looking for someplace to eat. </seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to creating these food samples. </seg>
<seg id="722">The Tokyo neighborhood of Kappabashi is home to a cluster of these small businesses that make plastic food samples, which German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his movie Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="723">While plastic food samples are so common in Japan as to be unnoticeable to most Japanese people, there is a new trend in Japan to turn them into eye-catching cellphone accessories and other knick-knacks. </seg>
<seg id="724">Writing on Naver Matome, blogger itinii has collected a variety of social media links with photos of this twist on shokuhin sanpuru. </seg>
<seg id="725">Now on sale: new smartphone straps based on food samples used at Kichijoji Tokyu department store. </seg>
<seg id="726">Food samples have been turned into a variety of kitschy collectibles including, in this case, refrigerator magnets: </seg>
<seg id="727">For a new display at Tokyo Station, here are some shokuhin sample fridge magnets. </seg>
<seg id="728">The food sample novelty boom is becoming increasingly more elaborate. </seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular seafood rice bowl) has been transformed into a smartphone stand. </seg>
<seg id="730">We've found a good use for a triangular serving dish (lol) as a smartphone stand. </seg>
<seg id="731">Once again, we made this for the Tokyo Station exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="732">And here, it's an apple that holds up your smartphone: </seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple with a notch cut out for a smaphone, this is a striking design. </seg>
<seg id="734">This is just the beginning of an increasing descent into whimsy. </seg>
<seg id="735">Some smartphone stand and case designers allow you to create your own work of art, in this case, by using ikura, or salmon roe that is a popular topping served with white rice. </seg>
<seg id="736">One Twitter user doubts: </seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone out there who is going to say, "Wow, cool, I can customize my smartphone case with salmon roe?" </seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one. </seg>
<seg id="739">The fake food accessory boom also can take perhaps less appetizing forms, including gag items to startle coworkers and family members. </seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest smartphone stand comes in the form of melting ice cream. </seg>
<seg id="741">We also have rice ball (onigiri) earrings and a dried salmon smartphone strap. </seg>
<seg id="742">To see more quirky uses of fake food, check out itinii's Naver Matome blog post, or follow the Twitter hashtag #食品サンプル#ストラップ. </seg>
<seg id="743">And to learn more about the original trend that started it all, this video provides a glimpse of Kappabashi in Tokyo, a district devoted to supplying the restaurant industry, including with shokuhin sanpuru. </seg>

<seg id="746">"For the victims of the war on drug traffickers". </seg>
<seg id="747">Photo by Flickr user Martín García. </seg>
<seg id="748">Used under the CC 2.0 license. </seg>
<seg id="749">Throughout the infamous "war on drug trafficking" in Mexico, both international and local media have regularly referred to the missing and the dead in statistical terms that fail to capture the enormity of human tragedy the war left in its wake. </seg>
<seg id="750">Moreover, coverage of drug barons like El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, has seriously overshadowed the stories of the conflict's victims. </seg>
<seg id="751">Little attention is paid to the bereaved the day after a violent event, or communities that have learned to live with daily pain. </seg>
<seg id="752">Every corpse, every bone found in each of the hundreds of clandestine graves, is the testimony of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and spouses, who harbour wounds that may never heal. </seg>
<seg id="753">Animal Político's digital project Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" ("Learning to Live with the Narco") aims to provide a voice to these victims by telling the stories of people who have been overwhelmed by the fighting between law enforcement and the cartels. </seg>
<seg id="754">Below is their description of the project: </seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only makes us fear for our lives. </seg>
<seg id="756">Its impact is felt beyond that. </seg>
<seg id="757">Like when popular supply stores close because of harassment from drug traffickers, forcing entire communities to travel kilometers to buy something as simple as milk. </seg>
<seg id="758">Pain, as told by the victims </seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Lives Changed by Fear" provides an insight into these stories. </seg>
<seg id="760">One protagonist is Guadalupe, a father who dedicates his weekends to seeking out his son in clandestine graves. </seg>
<seg id="761">Another is Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband, and two of her nephews on the same day. </seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "Once again, just like we do every Sunday, we prepare ourselves to carry out this task that we have set of going to look for graves, to look for our loved ones." </seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "My son's name is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata. </seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 years old when he disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="765">He's a father to three children. </seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical shop in El Naranjo. </seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13th, he left home and was to return on the 15th, but he never did." </seg>
<seg id="768">Emma Veleta: "It is extremely difficult for me because I have been left with my three daughters and need to provide them with an education. </seg>
<seg id="769">Aside from this, I have my mother, who is also here with me. </seg>
<seg id="770">Right now she does not have an income. </seg>
<seg id="771">My father left her his insurance and everything, but she cannot receive any of it because they are demanding a death certificate. </seg>
<seg id="772">And where are we supposed to get one? </seg>
<seg id="773">The makers of "Learning to Live with the Narco" explain the pressing nature of the project from the outset: </seg>
<seg id="774">Not just because we must urgently portray the faces of those who face fear, but because the conflicts, fragility, and governance of these countries are in the eyes of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="775">The project relies both on stories told by readers and reports by journalists in high risk areas. </seg>
<seg id="776">Below are some excerpts from these stories. </seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, an Animal Político reader, wrote this tract from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero, located in the center of the country. </seg>
<seg id="778">Her testimony reminds us that violence should never be normalised, however it manifests itself: </seg>
<seg id="779">For several years now, I have come to know morbidity and atrocious sensationalism. </seg>
<seg id="780">Every day, I pass newsstands where I see pages with images that could only otherwise be found in a criminology book or an expert's records. </seg>
<seg id="781">I see these lifeless bodies reflecting my own mortality. </seg>
<seg id="782">It puts me off and sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who feels disgusted or saddened, that it seems like a lack of respect for the person who once occupied this body. </seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot remain indifferent or normalize it. </seg>
<seg id="784">She continues: </seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to be a narco when he grows up, nor is it normal for people to walk the streets listening to ballads that tell the "feats" of crime. </seg>
<seg id="786">To me, they mock all of those who lost someone and those of us who fear that the same will happen to us. </seg>
<seg id="787">I see our fragility when stories turn into numbers in a tally. </seg>
<seg id="788">People's apathy is incredible to me, when they justify the death of six people and the forced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring city because they were "being unruly". </seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that the tragedy will not reach them so long as they stay put and remain silent. </seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L., from Mexico City, wrote a passage "Four Months of Extortion in the DF: a Family Plundered by Threats", where she talks about how the money that armed criminals took from her business month after month ultimately ended up destroying it and separating her family. </seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you lost, about how some people change your life in a matter of days. </seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never heals, the trauma remains, the fear will linger when you're alone. </seg>
<seg id="793">Habits change, as do telephone numbers. </seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact one another when necessary. </seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better. </seg>
<seg id="796">And she concluded: </seg>
<seg id="797">We want the other people to be arrested because you don't know when they're going to kidnap or kill you. </seg>
<seg id="798">I've asked myself if crying will resolve my deeply-rooted feelings during those horrible days, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to cry, because I have to learn to live with the pain. </seg>
<seg id="799">Reporter Mario Gutiérrez Vega published "The Forgotten Children of the City of Juárez: a Generation Marked by Violence". </seg>
<seg id="800">In his introduction, he raises questions such as: Who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organized crime? </seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like growing up in a marginal colony of the most dangerous city in Mexico? </seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys his age whose parents take care of them. </seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and says he has had to teach himself to cook an egg, fry potatoes, heat up tortillas, and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him, which is how he describes making them bottles with water, sugar, and powdered milk. </seg>
<seg id="804">He talks about the nine scars on his left leg, equal to the number of years of his life. </seg>
<seg id="805">Insignificant compared to the wounds engraved in his eyes, unspeakable for a boy for whom violence has been life itself and who has had to learn to live with it. </seg>
<seg id="806">At the age of five, they told him his mother had disappeared. </seg>
<seg id="807">But Bryan's childhood did not vanish that day. </seg>
<seg id="808">It had ended two years before, when, a few blocks from his house, he saw his father's bloodied body, murdered by armed men in a drive-by. </seg>
<seg id="809">This was the situation in Juárez when Bryan was born: </seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence from organized crime and its combat became embedded in the social issues that already existed in Juarez. </seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009, and 2010, it became the most dangerous place in the world due to the sheer quantity of murders, according to reports from the Citizen's Council for Public Safety and the U.S. government. </seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, state prosecutors counted 3,103 murders, an average of 8.5 per day. </seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of the hundreds of thousands of stories that organized crime is leaving behind in Mexico, permeating the country's soul. </seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories survive the latest news headlines, but this project reminds us of those who we mustn't forget. </seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to "Living with the narco", Animal Político launched a data journalism project in 2015 called Narcodata with the goal of simplifying the complex information behind the failed war on drugs that has plagued the country during the past four decades. </seg>

<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: This article and the pages it links to contain graphic images depicting violence. </seg>
<seg id="818">Fact-checking in the moment to quash a rumor or fabrication is important, but what about years after something first appeared? </seg>
<seg id="819">Social media content, whether true or false, has a way of hanging around. </seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photo from a horrific accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) seven years ago. </seg>
<seg id="821">Since it was first published, it has been misleadingly used all over the world to illustrate tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria and Myanmar. </seg>
<seg id="822">These incorrect pairings of image and event &#8212; "false descriptions" or "false contexts" (in Global Voices or First Draft News terminology) &#8212; don't negate the fact that there has been plenty of accurate reporting of the events in DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="823">However, it does raise questions about our appetite for images with news. </seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo </seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a fuel tanker traveling through Sange, a town in Eastern DRC, overturned and exploded, killing over 230 people. </seg>
<seg id="826">Years of neglect following civil war had ravaged Africa's second largest country and turned roads in the area into dangerous paths filled with difficult-to-navigate potholes. </seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to them. </seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball that engulfed dozens of homes and a cinema nearby that was packed with people watching World Cup football. </seg>
<seg id="829">Houses were scorched to a crisp and charred bodies littered the streets, with many people were burnt beyond recognition. </seg>
<seg id="830">This picture was taken in Sange, DRC, showing victims of a tanker explosion on July 3, 2010. </seg>
<seg id="831">This particular version was originally captioned as: “This is Nigeria.” by Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depicted the horrifying scenes from the day. </seg>
<seg id="832">Above is one example. </seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the ground as people look on. </seg>
<seg id="834">But the story doesn't end there. </seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, this same photo has been trotted out multiple times on social media, blogs, and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but unrelated tragedies, most notably incidents in Nigeria and Myanmar. </seg>
<seg id="836">What did and did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar </seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram militants attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon. </seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses graphically described atrocities that they were forced to flee from. </seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt and corpses lay in the streets and in bushes. </seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports that anywhere from 150 to 2,000 people were massacred, but the numbers couldn’t be confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="841">“No one stayed back to count bodies,” one resident told Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="842">Many were hacked, shot, and burnt to death. </seg>
<seg id="843">Only satellite images were available to illustrate the aftermath. </seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but Baga's army base has been a continual point of conflict between Nigeria's military and Boko Haram's effort to gain territory (examples from 2013 and in 2015). </seg>
<seg id="845">And this is where the DRC image appeared again, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible scale of the assault: </seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria. </seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2000 happened 2 days after Paris. </seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie. </seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead. pic.twitter.com/xm5AesVXOe </seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the DRC image was only one in a series of misattributions; Africa Check has documented associations with Nigeria since 2014. </seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the image was presented as proof of mass killings. </seg>
<seg id="852">Going further, personal commentary like this example incorrectly linked the DRC image to mainstream news sources to make the case. </seg>
<seg id="853">The Sange image also made an appearance in association to the deadly persecution of Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar. </seg>
<seg id="854">According to one flash report published by the United Nations (UN), those fleeing described beatings, rape, and a number of deaths, some by burning. </seg>
<seg id="855">As others reported violence against the Rohingya people, posts that paired descriptions with photos from DRC like the following appeared: </seg>
<seg id="856">This image comes from a Saudi Arabian news site that falsely alleged in 2012 that Myanmar President Thein Sein said monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims, and in addition used the DRC image to illustrate the information. </seg>
<seg id="857">The original post accessed 26 April 2017 is available here. </seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations, citing AFP as their source, also incorrectly attributed to Thein Sein the claim, but without falsely associating the DRC image. </seg>
<seg id="859">The global reach of false descriptions </seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these mistaken pairings go as far back as 2011 and 2012 and, indeed, are from all around the world. </seg>
<seg id="861">Using a “reverse image search,” you begin to see how extensively information can cross borders. </seg>
<seg id="862">A reverse image search engine on TinEye across 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017) found 344 very similar photos to the DRC photo in question on a mix of personal pages, social media platforms, and community and national publications. </seg>
<seg id="863">They are in many languages: English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek, Portuguese. </seg>
<seg id="864">Some forwarded the false reports, while others occasionally attempted to debunk the fabrications. </seg>
<seg id="865">We isolated examples of misuse and associated them to specific countries based upon what site they were published on in order to show the reach more clearly than that of language alone. </seg>
<seg id="866">More than one example of misuse may exist from the countries listed below (which are also sometimes linked to one another). </seg>
<seg id="867">Here are some of the cases that are still possible to fully track down (orange on the map): </seg>
<seg id="868">Map: NewsFrames. </seg>
<seg id="869">Country examples of false pairings of the DRC image with Nigeria or Myanmar. </seg>
<seg id="870">The orange countries indicate sites and servers where examples of fabricated or false news are still available. </seg>
<seg id="871">The countries in grey are examples that, according to the metadata and information available in TinEye, are likely to also exemplify false examples. </seg>
<seg id="872">As a reminder, the source of this image is the Democratic Republic of Congo (in blue). </seg>
<seg id="873">Algeria, 2012. “What's happening in Burma - Myanmar?” A link to the DRC picture was shared in an online discussion forum (aimed at Algerians and interested Arabs) as part of a thread on the “war of Buddhists against Muslims.” </seg>
<seg id="874">Brazil, 2011. “Cena Chocante! </seg>
<seg id="875">Cristãos queimados vivos! </seg>
<seg id="876">Verdadeiro ou falso?" (Shocking scene! </seg>
<seg id="877">Christians burned alive! </seg>
<seg id="878">True or false?). </seg>

<seg id="912">This 2014 article about students slain by Boko Haram, published by the now defunct, Catholic-minded news site Análisis Digital, explicitly stated that the image was not of the killings, though it claimed that it was of a “similar jihad attack.” </seg>

<seg id="918">The image was tweeted (and retweeted over 9,300 times) as evidence of the 2015 Boko Haram massacre, but the messages it was attached to did not engage in any religious framing. </seg>

<seg id="920">Vietnam(ese), 2014. </seg>
<seg id="921">After a message ostensibly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about a Nigerian massacre began to circulate, discussion boards in Vietnamese like this one translated it and proclaimed it a hoax. </seg>
<seg id="922">The message, which included the DRC image, has been disavowed by the Claretian Missionaries organization and Father Juan Carlos Martos. </seg>
<seg id="923">There are other confirmed examples of falsely using the image in Sweden, Poland, Belgium, Netherlands, and Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="924">Other accounts, aggregators, and sites from the following country locations (in grey on the map) are also suggested by TinEye, though no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan, and possibly China. </seg>
<seg id="925">(Records exist on the crawler engine with URLs and time-date stamps and occasionally possess image filenames related to Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.) </seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which occur much later than the original 2010 disaster, the image may ultimately bear a correct description, but the original post is not available or accessible. </seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures </seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that run through these posts, and the first focuses on religion. </seg>
<seg id="929">The photo has been used in terms of larger discussions about silence related to the killing of Christians by Muslims or, in defense of Muslims, the killing of Rohingyas by Buddhists. </seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss the undervaluing of African lives compared to European or French lives. </seg>
<seg id="931">Making sense of religion and the value of human life is important, which is why the use of images in association with these efforts is worth examining. </seg>
<seg id="932">But a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer trust these images. </seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are scores of people who may be inadvertently partaking in muddying the waters around a tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="934">Does the atmosphere of misinformation and disinformation suggest true atrocities are false and take away from the actual horror of what has, in fact, happened in DRC, in Nigeria, and in Myanmar? </seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has long been debated (as in this example). </seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images is a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy, and these images are at times requested by victims themselves. </seg>
<seg id="937">Yet there has also long been a concern that violent images desensitize readers and viewers, making them lose their ability to empathize (such as this study which examined the effects of violent media on helping others). </seg>
<seg id="938">While there's much to be debated about violent images in the news media, the fact is they're critical to news coverage today. </seg>
<seg id="939">As technologists experiment with algorithms to aid the fight against "fake news," they will need to think carefully about situations where a picture suggests one thing, when in fact it may be used out of context or altogether in a false way. </seg>
<seg id="940">Any analysis of false descriptions should also consider how truly international it can be. </seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons and used under a CC BY-ND 2.0 license. </seg>
<seg id="944">A blog called Untranslatable is setting out to provide language lovers with a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or impossible to translate. </seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in every language: they express situations or feelings, often complex or very specific. </seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these untranslatable words are already well-known by now (like the famous Portuguese saudade), and others are deeply rooted in a particular culture (for example, the Spanish sobremesa). </seg>
<seg id="947">But they all share the stubbornness with which they resist all attempts at simple translations. </seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression will not do, so a full explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to grasp the depth of the notion expressed in that one word. </seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have long been collected in lists online. </seg>
<seg id="950">But while such lists often stop at Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish, Untranslatable's creator and linguist Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages. </seg>
<seg id="951">For example, the blog shares words in the Mwotlap language from Vanuatu like: </seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Take care of your own parents, in recognition of all the care they've given you in your younger years. </seg>
<seg id="953">And words in Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as: </seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The laziness one feels after warming oneself in the sun on cold days. </seg>
<seg id="955">In Bird's own words from the blog's About page: </seg>
<seg id="956">They shed light on other cultures, reveal different patterns of thought, and spark our curiosity. </seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, they influence how we analyze and classify the world around us the linguists contributing to this site want to share more of these 'untranslatable' words, and in the process, show why these small languages are distinctive, valuable, and powerful. </seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "treasure languages" cherished by Untranslatable are invited to submit their favourite word here. </seg>

<seg id="970">The island nation of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flooding and landslide disaster in a decade. </seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the southwest monsoon that typically arrives in late May, heavy rains caused the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala, and Attanagalu Oya to spill over their banks in 15 districts, located in the country's southern and western regions. </seg>
<seg id="972">According to the May 28, 2017 advisory of the Sri Lankan Disaster Management Center, 126 people were killed and almost a hundred people went missing because of the floods and mudslides. </seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (May 26), and about 100,000 people were relocated to 304 safer locations. </seg>
<seg id="974">The rains subsided on Saturday (May 27) and water levels in some areas began to recede. </seg>
<seg id="975">Health and sanitation are a huge challenge in the affected areas which continue to be inaccessible. </seg>
<seg id="976">Below are some images and videos which show the extent of the flooding disaster: </seg>
<seg id="977">Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet have been updating about the flood situation regularly. </seg>

<seg id="997">I trust her with my 4 year old daughter, she trusts me with her children; she’s my rock. </seg>
<seg id="998">One minute we are shouting slogans for women’s rights. </seg>
<seg id="999">The next we are chanting for trans rights. </seg>
<seg id="1000">We are in a sea of umbrellas and people, some carrying the iconic image of a hijabi wrapped in an American flag, some chanting slogans against Islamophobia. </seg>
<seg id="1001">My friend looks at me and says, “You don’t have to deal with that stuff, right?” “Why, because I'm not Muslim?” I ask? </seg>
<seg id="1002">I have had this conversation before. </seg>
<seg id="1003">People I work with, or people who have known me for years, separate me, the Sahar they know, from the popular idea of “Muslims” built in their imagination. </seg>
<seg id="1004">They de-Muslim me. </seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide. </seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same. </seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently. </seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify with being Muslim differently. But somehow we all get packed into the same Muslim box. </seg>
<seg id="1009">This box is so well constructed in our collective imaginations that when Muslims like me don’t fit in it, we get de-Muslimed. </seg>
<seg id="1010">Being De-Muslimed </seg>
<seg id="1011">I am not alone in this. </seg>
<seg id="1012">It's even happened to the best-selling poet in America: Rumi. </seg>

<seg id="1014">Love? </seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace? </seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was my age, he was an orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar. </seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were central to his poetry until the day he died. </seg>
<seg id="1018">But Rumi’s religion has been erased from Western imagination and most popular translations of his poetry. </seg>
<seg id="1019">This erasure is a big part of the story of the world's 1.7 billion Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is the reductionist images of Muslims that have colonized western books for centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1021">This seductive imagery is defined by the dark men you should fear and the exotic women you should save. </seg>
<seg id="1022">The path-breaking Palestinian American scholar Edward Said deconstructed the history behind these images in the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="1023">But these images stand tall today. </seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry, and Hollywood all continue to perpetuate them. </seg>
<seg id="1025">I’ve worked in the news industry for 13 years, and I’ve seen this powerful flawed narrative dominate our newsfeeds. </seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries in the last three decades, while the US couldn’t even elect its first real female presidential candidate in 2016. </seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognize that French Muslim women prevented from wearing their hijab in public buildings and Saudi Muslim women forced to cover their bodies by their government, are two sides of the same coin. </seg>
<seg id="1028">It’s one powerful group exerting its “control” on the “other”. </seg>
<seg id="1029">This powerful narrative diminishes Muslim women leading movements for change. </seg>
<seg id="1030">It ignores that the first Muslim prayers on American soil were said by Africans brought here on slave ships. </seg>
<seg id="1031">It erases the existence of Queer Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has captured our collective imaginations so deeply and so inaccurately that Sikh men and children are often targets of anti-Muslim attacks and bullying. </seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of the stories we tell, and the way we tell them, Islamophobia today, isn’t just fear of Islam, the religion, it is fear of the “other”. </seg>
<seg id="1034">Belonging to the 1.7 billion </seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we tell more than just stories based on facts. </seg>
<seg id="1036">Or alternative facts. </seg>
<seg id="1037">We also build narratives that help you make sense of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has epically failed at capturing the narrative of the 1.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1039">And we’ve failed them here, where 7 million Muslims make up the most “diverse” religious group in America. </seg>

<seg id="1062">When social scientists describe religious life, they refer to the three Bs: belief, behavior, and belonging. </seg>
<seg id="1063">My Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible, but it’s there. </seg>
<seg id="1064">Perhaps my friend, my neighbor, my rock, would see that I’m Muslim if she could see through the 50 feet of concrete and air that separates our homes. </seg>
<seg id="1065">She’d see the nighttime ritual with my daughter, cradled in the crook of my arm, me whispering the Arabic protection verses that seal the Quran called the Quls. </seg>
<seg id="1066">Repeating them three times each. </seg>
<seg id="1067">Asking her to be protected from the evil that can be seen and cannot be seen. </seg>

<seg id="1073">Being Muslim is saying the prayers she tells me to say when I’m having a bad day. </seg>
<seg id="1074">Being Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God: Allah Mian, which means God, my only master. </seg>
<seg id="1075">For a people colonized- for centuries-by an “empire” that started as a corporation called the Honorable British East India Company, calling God, my only master, has deep meaning. </seg>

<seg id="1080">Belonging is knowing that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians, like my grandfather, whose families were torn apart by colonialists who divided the Muslim world like a game of risk. </seg>
<seg id="1081">Being Muslim is knowing that Europeans “colonized” all but four Muslim countries in the last two centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1082">It is knowing that the first aerial bomb ever was dropped a century ago on a Muslim country. </seg>
<seg id="1083">It is knowing that around the same time, my grandmother’s grandfather, an Indian Kashmiri British imperialist subject, was called “dangerous” by newspapers of the time for running the first mosque in England. </seg>

<seg id="1090">It’s knowing that now more than half a million Iraqis are buried under the rubble of war. </seg>

<seg id="1092">It is knowing that when tragedy strikes in the US and a suspect has a Muslim name, the story receives four times more coverage than a story involving a white attacker. </seg>
<seg id="1093">It is knowing that fourteen hundred years ago, the first call to prayer, the Azaan, was said by a freed black slave named Bilal. </seg>
<seg id="1094">It is knowing that an African Islamic scholar named Bilali Muhammad was enslaved and brought to this land two hundred years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1095">It is calling Malcolm X an American hero. </seg>
<seg id="1096">It’s the warmth I felt when people overwhelmed the airports to fight the Muslim Ban. </seg>

<seg id="1098">Being an American and a Pakistani and a Kashmiri and a Pahari and a Punjabi and a Muslim and a journalist is knowing the inherent intersectionality of our multi-hyphenated identities, but failing to communicate it to you. </seg>

<seg id="1100">Being a mother it is the worry I carry for my child, and all Muslim children, knowing that powerful, privileged people build structural Islamophobia on these binaries. </seg>

<seg id="1118">And this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1119">There’s a reason conspiracy theorists that existed in the dark corners of the Internet now run the White House. </seg>
<seg id="1120">They rose exponentially because they “othered” Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="1121">There’s another group that rose exponentially by creating the “other” out of all of us. </seg>

<seg id="1130">All of us need to ask ourselves, why? </seg>
<seg id="1131">Why am I telling you this at a TEDx talk at Stanford in 2017, when Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are waged and people are dehumanized by creating the “other” in popular imagination, was a scholar at Stanford four decades ago. </seg>
<seg id="1132">We need to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about our roles in consciously and unconsciously perpetuating the “other”; like my friend and I did in the rain at the Women’s March, because the work of imagining a new future, where we don’t have a President eating chocolate cake while bombing broken countries and “othered” people, goes way beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us. </seg>
<seg id="1134">A Storytelling Initiative Aims to Preserve Urban Linguistic Diversity &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, under licence CC BY-NC-ND 2.0. </seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone, here and now, despite a language barrier? </seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founders of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, storytelling in original languages is a possible answer. </seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported about another initiative led by Steven Bird, the Untranslatable blog. </seg>
<seg id="1139">Here though, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word, and is an effort to preserve and celebrate the linguistic diversity of large cities. </seg>
<seg id="1140">Indeed, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin, Australia, or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, small and not-so-small languages are often at risk of not being passed on to the children born there. </seg>
<seg id="1141">For the project's creators: </seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the world's languages can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not need to forget who they are in order to belong. </seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening is often connected to understanding", these events aim instead to "listen to appreciate, to feel, to connect". </seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first tell their stories in their own language and then translate or explain them in English. </seg>
<seg id="1145">Although the participants are not professional storytellers, their commitment and their acting engage the audience and provoke laughter and emotion, as if the language was not a barrier anymore. </seg>
<seg id="1146">For example, the video below is a traditional story from Burkina Faso told in the Dafing language. </seg>
<seg id="1147">During the question session, the storyteller, Rassidatou Konate, also has an opportunity to explain her country's storytelling customs. </seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the story of the hare and the baboon in the Shona language of Zimbabwe: </seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his tale, John Nyamusara is asked "What is it like to speak to an audience that is not understanding your language?" With a large smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness: </seg>
<seg id="1150">"They were listening! </seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive... </seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!" </seg>
<seg id="1153">While Treasure Language Storytelling events have taken place in three cities so far, the organisers hope to expand, and anyone inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS to organise their own storytelling performance. </seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Ricans Hold a 'Vigil for Light and Truth' to Demand an Audit of Public Debt &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="1155">“Today, vigil for light and truth." #AuditNOW. Various civic and religious organizations came together on April 3 for a mass vigil to call for an audit of Puerto Rico's public debt, which has reached 72 billion US dollars. The vigil started in front of the Puerto Rican capitol, and continued as a march that culminated in the Plaza de Colón in Old San Juan. </seg>
<seg id="1156">The protest was called by the group Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda (Citizen Front for the Audit of the Debt) and the Coalición Ecuménica e Interreligiosa de Puerto Rico (Ecumenical and Inter-religious Coalition of Puerto Rico). </seg>
<seg id="1157">Those calling for an audit also started a petition on the White House's official page, which currently has 7,727 signatures. </seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand: </seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico demand for the politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debt to be held liable for their corruption. </seg>
<seg id="1160">We demand a financial oversight and management board with no personal interests in the debt, with a fixed salary attune with our financial reality, and working to benefit our economy. </seg>
<seg id="1161">We are being extorted and we are being enslaved. </seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not ours. </seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education or healthcare. </seg>
<seg id="1164">Our elders will not have their pensions reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action. </seg>
<seg id="1166">The island – an unincorporated territory of the US – is facing a serious financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="1167">This is why the Center for a New Economy, an independent, non-profit, non-partisan organization focused on promoting the country's socioeconomic development, is proposing a Fiscal Responsibility Law, instead of the Financial Control Board imposed by the federal US government. </seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons: </seg>
<seg id="1169">Puerto Rico's economic and fiscal crisis requires a broad restructuring of Puerto Rico's fiscal infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="1170">An effort imposed from the outside without the participation and conviction of Puerto Rican residents runs the risk of being rejected by the country's citizens. </seg>
<seg id="1171">The event was titled "Vigil for light and truth". </seg>

<seg id="1180">Bassel Safadi and his wife Noura. </seg>
<seg id="1181">Photo from Noura Ghazi Safadi's Facebook page. </seg>
<seg id="1182">Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil aka Bassel Safadi has been missing for more than a year. </seg>
<seg id="1183">But he has not been forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and loved ones continue to campaign for his freedom and celebrate his contributions to the open web. </seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's edition of re:publica, the annual digital culture conference held in Berlin, featured a session dedicated to the #FreeBassel campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher at the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, the CEO of Book Sprints, a rapid book production and publishing company, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: A Collective Inquiry. </seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and available in the public domain, contains a series of essays reflecting on free culture in the face of oppression. </seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work. </seg>
<seg id="1189">The introduction reads: </seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how free knowledge movements are built and the real costs attached to them. </seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, and writers involved with free knowledge movements have worked together to see further than the fog of our news feeds and produce some sense from our different experiences. </seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is born in an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, loved and celebrated Internet volunteer detained in Syria since 15 March 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1193">His name has been deleted from the Adra Prison’s register where he was detained, on 3 October 2015. </seg>
<seg id="1194">We have not received any information about his current status or whereabouts since. </seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of this book called Collective Memory gives voice to his friends and family that have been urging for his release and want him back in his normal life and freedom, immediately. </seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing Bassel paying a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us have started to reflect on our own fates, actions, and choices. </seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today? </seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we chosen? </seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme belief? </seg>
<seg id="1200">The open source web developer and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was taken from Adra prison, a civilian facility, to an undisclosed location. </seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that “military police took Bassel from his cell in Adra with a ‘top secret’ sealed order from the Military Field Court.” </seg>
<seg id="1203">On November 12, 2015, Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people who identified themselves as insiders in the Assad government who informed her of an alleged death sentence against her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his location and condition remain unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1205">A Creative Commons leader in Syria and active in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a pivotal role in extending online access and knowledge to the public in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer and technologist who is currently the interim director of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book: </seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassel’s cultural prototypes were more prescient than the work he started around 2005, with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists, to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra. </seg>
<seg id="1208">One of the world’s most important archaeological sites, Palmyra stood at the crossroads of several civilizations, with Graeco-Roman architectural styles melding with local traditions and Persian influences. </seg>
<seg id="1209">Little could Bassel know that ten years after he began, Daesh fundamentalists would be actively deleting this architecture embodying Syrian, and the world’s, cultural heritage. </seg>
<seg id="1210">But his foray into digital archaeology and preservation created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public, researchers, and artists for years to come. </seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet been able to complete this project. </seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book, writing about her husband's passion to share knowledge with others, even while in prison: </seg>
<seg id="1213">I’ve lived all my life dreaming of Freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace it. </seg>
<seg id="1214">I feel overwhelmed when I mention his name. </seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me to master English, even while he’s been in prison. </seg>
<seg id="1216">I’ve learned to read, write, and speak English well. </seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked, and has also taught many prisoners to read, write, and speak English. </seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology for me, he taught me to use both computers and smartphones. </seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners to use computers theoretically, without having one in their hands. </seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting, a prose book written to her husband between 2012 and 2015, while he was in prison. </seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura spent a year working together on the book. </seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him, and he would translate them from Arabic into English. </seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available in the public domain. </seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover by Youssef Abdalki. </seg>
<seg id="1226">Book dedicated to the public domain. </seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt entitled "It happens", from Noura's book: </seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens on every visit </seg>
<seg id="1229">that I sink into the world of your magical eyes </seg>
<seg id="1230">that I lose consciousness in the moment we embrace, </seg>
<seg id="1231">that I don't care about any of the dangers, </seg>
<seg id="1232">any of the fences, chains and guards </seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the hustle of the jail </seg>
<seg id="1234">and I penetrate into every detail of your voice and words </seg>
<seg id="1235">that I carry with me with passion, </seg>
<seg id="1236">when your eyes say goodbye </seg>
<seg id="1237">and I leave another piece of my soul with you... </seg>
<seg id="1238">I return quickly to my solitude, </seg>
<seg id="1239">to retrieve all the moments, </seg>
<seg id="1240">and cry your absence and smile. </seg>
<seg id="1241">I convince myself that you will return soon... </seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of Bassel's imprisonment, Ghazi wrote: </seg>
<seg id="1243">A year passes, my soul </seg>
<seg id="1244">While </seg>
<seg id="1245">I'm in your cage, </seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still In the cage of the monsters </seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassel's story is not unique in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in 2011, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights. </seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who have been arrested or forcibly disappeared by the regime have faced torture and even executions. </seg>
<seg id="1250">As of 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians had died in custody since 2011, according to the international human rights group Amnesty International. </seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many more people remain unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has called for Bassel's release since 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our call today in the hope that it will be our last. </seg>
<seg id="1254">A Mozambican Politician Who Was Imprisoned for Corruption Returns to His Post After Release &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambicans reacted indignantly to a corruption case involving a senior government figure who, after finishing half a prison term, returned to work for the state in the same institution where the case happened. </seg>
<seg id="1256">The case concerns Diodino Cambaza, who was detained in 2008 and found guilty in 2010 along with four others of misusing 54 million meticais (880,000 dollars) of public funds in the Mozambique's Airports company. </seg>
<seg id="1257">Cambaza presided over the company's administrative council between 2005 and 2008. </seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, but was freed in 2016 for good behaviour. He immediately sought his reinstatement in the company, which was made official on 19 April. </seg>
<seg id="1259">According to an announcement by Mozambique's Public Prosecutors Office, which judged the request, there is no impediment to Cambaza returning to his old post because the company did not hold a disciplinary process after his prison term. </seg>
<seg id="1260">However, various citizens did not take kindly to the news. </seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre of Public Integrity (CIP), a local institution which advocates public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the company’s decision to reemploy him: </seg>
<seg id="1262">represents a reversal for the efforts in the fight against corruption, lack of transparency and even in the efforts of justice, the CIP says. </seg>
<seg id="1263">What we note is that the company should have taken disciplinary procedures against the offender. </seg>
<seg id="1264">But it seems that the company stayed silent, and did not implement the appropriate disciplinary procedure for the application of due functions. </seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice on Mozambican social media, also rejected this attitude and considered the case "sickening": </seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent person, he would be a consultant, after being sentenced and completing half the term. </seg>
<seg id="1267">He would give paid lectures and motivational speeches, he would provide consultancy and reform with a reserved image. </seg>
<seg id="1268">But because he is incompetent, he accepted being reemployed by the company that he helped to damage. </seg>
<seg id="1269">So, it is clear: what Cambaza really likes is being paid for his silence. </seg>
<seg id="1270">Sickening! </seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Mozambican political science in Brazil, argued that Cambaza had no morals at all: </seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza rewarded by a state which he defrauded: I do not believe that somebody should be rewarded like this, somebody who has at some point seriously offended the state. </seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza does not have the morals to return to serve the state, *he already had a unique opportunity to serve it, but he, for his part, only served himself from the state. </seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible money box, and the state became tired of this man, being in turn summoned, judged and finally sentenced to a heavy prison term. </seg>
<seg id="1275">Sincerely speaking I do not know why this man was rewarded like this. </seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte preferred to remember the first president of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to highlight that a thief’s place is in prison: </seg>
<seg id="1277">The place of a thief is in prison Samora Machel will be eternally remembered by Mozambicans not only for having been the first president of independent Mozambique, but also for his powerful, incisive and, one could say, prophetic speeches. </seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous speeches was when he asserted peremptorily that “an ambitious person is capable of everything, of selling the homeland only because of their ambition, of their personal interest”. </seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said that “I do not know if somebody ambitious changes, but my own experience shows not, they change tactics, but do not eliminate the ambition. </seg>
<seg id="1280">Somebody ambitious is criminal at the same time”. </seg>
<seg id="1281">On Twitter, the reactions also critical of the decision: </seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, served 10 and came out. </seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company at which he misused funds renewed the contract </seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo, of the newspaper @Verdade, remarked that crime appears to pay in Mozambique: </seg>
<seg id="1285">Actually, in Mozambique being a thief and a vassal of Frelimo pays. Diodino Cambaza, sentenced to the heaviest prison term, returned to Mozambique's Airports </seg>

<seg id="1287">Burmese word “Kalar pae” means chick pea or split pea. </seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported </seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Myanmar Facebook users, their posts are being taken down by the popular social media company for containing the word 'kalar'. </seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the etymology of the word is still debated, it is traditionally used to refer to people of east Indian origin or as an adjective meaning "Indian" in general. </seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is censoring the word "kalar" or ကုလား (in Burmese script) as part of its initiative to tackle the problem of widespread hate speech on the Burmese language social network. </seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely derogatory connotation. </seg>
<seg id="1293">'Kalar' is used by ultra-nationalists and religious fundamentalists to attack Muslims in Myanmar especially the Rohingya minority in the northwest part of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1294">But in this effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a good deal of viable content from its platform. </seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar' may be commonly associated with racism today, but the word on its own does not necessarily constitute hate speech. </seg>
<seg id="1296">Context matters &#8212; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the term, or expressed concern about its usage, were censored as well. </seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several Burmese words with completely different meanings that contain the same string of characters as 'kalar'. </seg>
<seg id="1298">For instance, chair in Burmese is also written 'kalar htaing', which contains the same characters, as well as other words such as 'kalar pae' (split pea), 'kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain). </seg>
<seg id="1299">Aung Kaung Myat, writer, explained on Facebook the different meanings of words that sound like 'kalar': </seg>
<seg id="1300">A post made by one of my friends was deleted today because there was the word, kalar, in it. </seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he was wittily asking his friends if they know where he can cure his lower back pain by using a pun. </seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase, ku la — ‘cure’ (ku) + question word (la) in Burmese language — bears striking resemblance verbatim with the racist term but they are wholly different in context. </seg>
<seg id="1303">There have been various reactions to this initiative of Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet thinks that it will reduce hate speech posts of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before it removes any post suspected of promoting racism: </seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook team is not manually deleting the word "Kalar". </seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word. </seg>
<seg id="1307">That's why it won't understand any status you write. </seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do is that they should carefully analyse post and validate using the words beside it. </seg>
<seg id="1309">For instance, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (split peas). </seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who are spreading hate-speech will have a pretty good lesson. </seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to curtail their nationalism. </seg>
<seg id="1312">While the move may send a strong signal to those spouting hate speech, the efficacy of this strategy might not last long. </seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social media platforms in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have proven that keyword censorship often becomes a game of cat-and-mouse, wherein social media users will simply begin using a new word or alternate spelling of the censored word in order to keep expressing their views. </seg>
<seg id="1314">Writer Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to remove his posts when he simply notified his friends that the word 'kalar' is already banned on the social network: </seg>
<seg id="1315">...when I discovered this new policy of Facebook, I made a post telling my Facebook friends the word is banned. </seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed by Facebook and I was banned from liking, posting, and sharing content on Facebook for 24 hours because the post “doesn’t follow the Facebook Community Standards”. </seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed numerous posts by people who do not have any negative intentions or who were simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech used by radical nationalists. </seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post not related to hate speech was taken down: </seg>
<seg id="1319">Non-hate speech post removed by Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author was sharing his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad. </seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before launching this initiative like consulting the Burmese Internet community: </seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook might have good intention to minimise racism in Burma through their platform but that's not how it works. </seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will just bring more hatred among different communities. </seg>
<seg id="1324">Plus, they seemed to initiate that without proper local context nor tech support hence banning words like "chair" and "pea curry". </seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they don't attempt to rectify wrongly deleted posts. </seg>
<seg id="1326">If only they could respect a bit more to 15 million user base that's generating a great revenue for them, it'd be great. </seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automated censorship has made users to mock its approach. </seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook by deliberately writing the word 'kalar' in non-hate speech context to see if their posts would be taken down. </seg>
<seg id="1329">Here are some screenshots of Facebook posts that have been removed despite containing nothing resembling hate speech: </seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission. </seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text says “I want to sit on a chair and eat split peas curry and watch an Indian movie. </seg>
<seg id="1332">Just testing if Facebook will remove the post that contains kalar.” </seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, Myanmar has seen the rise of extreme nationalist ideology and religious fundamentalists who have been using social media to amplify their voices and influence. </seg>
<seg id="1337">Hate speech is blamed, among others, for stirring communal violence in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine state where clashes between Muslims and Buddhists displaced thousands of residents. </seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticitized for its failure to tackle the rampant hate speech occurring on its Burmese pages. </seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply deciding to censor the word 'kalar', it should have reviewed and learned from ongoing initiatives that aim to combat online hate speech in Myanmar that focus on context, rather than code. </seg>
<seg id="1340">Child Marriage Is No More in Trinidad &#038; Tobago &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="1341">Wedding ring in sand. </seg>
<seg id="1342">Photo by Derek Gavey, CC BY 2.0. </seg>
<seg id="1343">Child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago. </seg>
<seg id="1344">On June 9, 2017, the country's parliament unanimously passed legislation to outlaw the practice, changing the legal marriage age to 18. </seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this amendment of the Marriage Act, some members of the Hindu and Muslim religious communities adhered to the practice, and there was great public outcry in May 2016 when Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), a group that brings together representatives from the country's diverse religious groups, said that the state should not interfere because “age did not determine maturity”. </seg>
<seg id="1346">This, despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which defines minors as “every human being below the age of 18”. </seg>
<seg id="1347">UN statistics for the period 2002-2012 in Trinidad and Tobago show that the percentage of children who were married by age 15 was 1.8 percent and by 18, 8.1 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's Central Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8,400 girls and 1,300 boys under 19 were married between 1997-2007. </seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media agitation seeking to get child marriage laws off the books were swift and well supported, and no doubt aided this end result. </seg>
<seg id="1350">However, there were hiccups. </seg>
<seg id="1351">One Hindu leader, for instance, had no qualms about telling child marriage critics to "mind own damn business". </seg>
<seg id="1352">Such religious opposition made what would ordinarily have been a straightforward issue a little more fraught and at one point, there was doubt as to whether the opposition would even support the bill. </seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017, the Miscellaneous Provisions Marriage Bill was passed — even with four opposition senators (including a woman) and one independent choosing to abstain &#8212; paving the way for the bill to be debated in the the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make it into law. </seg>
<seg id="1354">Now, all that remains is for the country's president to assent to it, then have the law proclaimed. </seg>
<seg id="1355">On Instagram, Leslie-Ann Boiselle re-posted the Facebook status update of one of the country's senators: #girlsnotbrides #historywasmadetoday #endchildmarriage #letourchildrenbechildren #letourgirlsbegirls #trinidadandtobago🇹🇹 A post shared by Leslie Ann Boisselle (@trinilab) on Jun 9, 2017 at 5:25pm PDT It reads: </seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator The Honourable Clarence Rambharat: The Miscellaneous Provisions (Marriage) Bill, 2016 has been passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 35 members in support and none against. </seg>
<seg id="1357">Having been previously passed in the Senate, the Bill can now move towards becoming law. </seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were elated that the laws on child marriage had finally changed. </seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook user Lovell Francis, who holds the post of minister in the ministry of education, said: </seg>
<seg id="1360">It was overlong and full of pointless double talk but you know what child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and that is worth almost any price. </seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abeo Jackson thought it certainly took long enough to do away with the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas jubilant that the day had come at last: </seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Facebook status update by Lara Quentrall-Thomas, which says, "Excellent news! </seg>
<seg id="1363">The Marriage bill has been passed. </seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, Vote - 35 in favor - 0 against!!!!" </seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that was quite outspoken about the need for the bill to pass, noted: </seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in TnT, regardless of religion, is 18years old. </seg>
<seg id="1367">The Bill to amend the marriage acts was passed today June 9, 2017. </seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 parliamentarians in the House of Representatives and 35 were present for the vote. </seg>
<seg id="1369">All parliamentarians in attendance voted in favour of the Bill. </seg>
<seg id="1370">The laws of TnT no longer allow for child marriage. </seg>
<seg id="1371">It's been a long struggle #childmarriageischildabuse </seg>
<seg id="1372">With much thanks to all activists who led this struggle. </seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations. </seg>
<seg id="1374">Thank you to our legislators. </seg>
<seg id="1375">But there may be a fly in the ointment in the form of Sat Maharaj, the secretary general of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most high-profile Hindu organisation. </seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj had announced his intention to take legal action should the legislation have passed, and appears he is following through. </seg>
<seg id="1377">While Attorney General Faris Al Rawi, who championed the bill, has said it is Maharaj's legal right to challenge it, most social media users wished that debate about the issue could be approached differently. </seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested: </seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, If, instead of framing the discussion broadly, and in a way guaranteed simply to generate panic and resentment, as 'inviting the state into our bedrooms', we talk about the specific issue of the state 'protecting our girl children from any possibility of being abused by big, hard back, advantageous men', would you be prepared to go on with that discussion? </seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that's a non-issue? </seg>
<seg id="1381">Whether it is eventually challenged in court or not, this legislation is an important step &#8212; but there are still places in the world where child marriage enjoys various shades of legality or continues to be the norm, despite laws to the contrary. </seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page on January 18, 2012, illustrating its international blackout in opposition to SOPA and PIPA copyright legislation in the US. </seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0) </seg>
<seg id="1393">It has been more than one month since Turkey blocked Wikipedia, the popular crowdsourced encyclopedia. </seg>
<seg id="1394">With each day, it is becoming more apparent just how vital a role the platform plays in helping users find and share reliable information online. </seg>
<seg id="1395">Students, reporters and TV series fanatics alike are struggling under the block. </seg>
<seg id="1396">While tech-savvy Turkish internet users are accustomed to using circumvention tools to access blocked content &#8212; a recent New York Times article reported that Turkey has the third-highest VPN prevalence in the world &#8212; many habitual Wikipedia users do not fall into that category. </seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has blocked articles on Wikipedia since 2008, as noted in a recent report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, these blocks are in keeping with regular censorship of the internet since 2007, when the Internet Law (No. 5651) was passed. </seg>
<seg id="1398">With the wholesale censorship of Wikipedia, Turkey has become only the second known country in the world, after China, to block Wikipedia. </seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains blocked, multiple "mirror" websites &#8212; sites designed to reproduce the content of Wikipedia, which is constantly being updated &#8212; have sprung up. </seg>
<seg id="1400">One such solution came from IPFS (the Inter-Planetary File System) when the platform put all of Turkish Wikipedia on their decentralized peer-to-peer hosting network, which does not rely on the domain name system, and thus is very difficult to fully censor. </seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is thus accessible regardless of the government ban. </seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS described their effort: </seg>
<seg id="1403">Upon hearing the news , we revived an effort to put snapshots of Wikipedia on IPFS, so that people may be able to read it in a decentralized and distributed way. </seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help people to at least view all of the Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach Wikipedia.org itself. </seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also emphasized that they did this independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and that what they've published are screenshots, not live or dynamic versions of the site. </seg>
<seg id="1406">Wikimedia has been involved in other efforts to get round the block, however. </seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has created both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Wikipedia mirror website, and WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirror websites if their country ever bans Wikipedia. </seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni told Global Voices contributor and Asia Community Catalyzer at Mozilla Subhashish Panigrahi about mirroring for Wikipedia on Panigrahi's 'Open Speaks' podcast. </seg>
<seg id="1409">Below is a short excerpt from their interview: </seg>
<seg id="1410">It's not a complete copy a proxy a mirror. - you access a different URL which is not the usual url and what you see is taken from Wikipedia. </seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server redirects your request to the real wikipedia so you can see it even if you are in Turkey where Wikipedia is blocked, because that work is done by a server which is not in Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="1412">Mirroring is one of the easiest ways to make Wikipedia content available. </seg>

<seg id="1415">Image by Sagar Giri. </seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission. </seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos that he saw around him – blurry, with subjects poorly positioned and washed-out colors. </seg>
<seg id="1418">So, he was motivated to carry a camera of his own and try to fix the situation. </seg>
<seg id="1419">That was when he was a child. </seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar is striving to put Nepal’s wildlife on the international stage. </seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, which sits next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that call attention to Nepal's animal world. </seg>
<seg id="1422">He explained on Facebook how this prime location helps him with his work: </seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on edge of the World Heritage Site Chitwan National Park, what can be better for a wildlife Photographer enthusiast!! </seg>
<seg id="1424">So, today i was resting at my place and suddenly Navaraj (Manager at Chitwan Gaida Lodge) calls me, he got my dad's call that there is the leopard at the bank of Rapti river. </seg>
<seg id="1425">The River dam just a few minutes away at the touristic place of Sauraha. </seg>
<seg id="1426">I immediately ran with my camera &amp; reached within minutes. </seg>
<seg id="1427">My Dad had been watching him, showed me the place across the River a long Distance where Leopard was and immediately my shutter burst began!! </seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aspires to work with the government to get Nepal's nature recognized worldwide and wants to create awareness that wild animals are not fearsome as they look. </seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know &#8212; he's had encounters with tigers: </seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger doesn't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep!! </seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening too low on the light. </seg>
<seg id="1432">Home time for all the animals &amp; birds. </seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also returning home coz of darkness, then suddenly appears the King from the Bushes, immediately sits when we both see each other &amp; Stares at me through the sal trees!! </seg>
<seg id="1434">Seeing the need to protect wild animals, Sagar puts the logo “i click for conservation” in his pictures. </seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for promoting the nature and wildlife of Nepal, however, isn’t always easy. </seg>
<seg id="1436">He has waited for 22 days to shoot photos of otters in Bardia National Park living mostly in a tent, and up to 12 days to capture images of tigers, and six to seven days to get a perfect shot of birds living in nearby lodges. </seg>
<seg id="1437">Take a look at some of his photos below. </seg>

<seg id="1466">Women in the small Indian village of Gumla Jam Gayi in Jharkhand. </seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization based in India. </seg>
<seg id="1470">An edited version is published below as part of a content-sharing agreement. </seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, a woman will go to great lengths to avoid saying her husband’s name and even that of elder men in the family. </seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, she will use a pronoun or ‘father of my child’. </seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra to Uttar Pradesh, women affirm that social pressure to respect one’s husband, and a fear of the consequences of not following the norm, keep this practice alive. </seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, a kangaroo court sentenced Malati Mahatoto from the Indian State of Odisha to be ostracized from her family and the entire village after she addressed an in-law by his name. </seg>
<seg id="1475">While many men also reciprocate the tradition by not calling their wives by their names, they face far lesser censure, if any, when they don’t follow the practice. </seg>
<seg id="1476">In a small village called Walhe, in Pune district, Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, have become members of a unique club that are fast becoming the talk of the town. </seg>
<seg id="1477">A space that is their very own to discuss and debate the nuances of patriarchy. </seg>
<seg id="1478">The club is one of 56 being run across 13 states in India and is part of #KhelBadal, a campaign to dismantle patriarchy being run by Video Volunteers. </seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawar, who for the past seven years has used her video camera to expose practices ranging from child marriages to ostracisation of people living with HIV/AIDS face, runs these clubs. </seg>
<seg id="1480">She shares how these clubs have created a safe space for these women and turned them into agents of change as well. </seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video Rohini decided to screen in her discussion club was on the practice of women not addressing their husbands by their first name. </seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this because she wanted to throw open the conversation on patriarchy with an issue that the women could easily engage with. </seg>
<seg id="1483">Not being able to call their husbands’ names out is a practice they have all dutifully upheld, and not once questioned. </seg>
<seg id="1484">According to Rohini: </seg>
<seg id="1485">This custom indicates that a woman respects her husband and wants him to live a long life. </seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn’t follow it will be seen as cunning, a woman with no morals. </seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we hadn’t given it thought until this discussion club. </seg>
<seg id="1488">To begin with, Rohini wanted to test out the waters at her own home where she had never called her husband by his name. </seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the discussion club video to her husband and mother-in-law. </seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts: </seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and husband were quiet for a long time after the video ended. </seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned around and told me to call him by his name from then on. </seg>
<seg id="1493">Armed with this confidence, Rohini started her first discussion club. </seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women hadn’t heard the word ‘patriarchy’ ever before; some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would remain protected. </seg>
<seg id="1495">The session started with Rohini screening a video on the issue from Uttar Pradesh. </seg>
<seg id="1496">After watching the video the women tried an exercise to get the discussion going. </seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say her husband’s name in a variety of emotions – happy, angry, sad, loving and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1498">She asked them all, “If we can’t say our husbands’ names, and they can call us whatever they like, does that mean they don’t respect us? </seg>
<seg id="1499">Shouldn’t it be equal?” </seg>
<seg id="1500">“Some of these women have been married for 30 years and that was the first day they uttered their husbands’ names,” says Rohini Pawar, from Walhe Village, Maharashtra about breaking an age-old custom where married women are never supposed to say their husband’s names. </seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says: </seg>
<seg id="1502">During the activity, one woman was so shy she just giggled for the duration of the exercise; another decided to vent all her cumulative frustration against him and his family by cursing him. </seg>
<seg id="1503">The look on their faces was ecstatic. </seg>
<seg id="1504">I don’t think I’ll ever forget it. </seg>
<seg id="1505">Still high on an adrenaline rush of having smashed an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to say their husband’s names when they got home. </seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word. </seg>
<seg id="1507">Over the next few days, Rohini got a variety of updates. </seg>
<seg id="1508">One woman’s husband called Rohini to ask what ideas she was putting in the women’s heads: His wife wouldn’t stop calling out his name. </seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinnertime in front of her entire family. </seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law glared at her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, “Rohini told me to do it.” </seg>
<seg id="1512">One participant’s husband was less understanding and the situation ended in violence. </seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini shares how women have tried to stop other practices like wearing vermilion on their forehead: </seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that we’re married? </seg>
<seg id="1515">I told my husband that if he’d wear vermillion, I’d do it too. </seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed, and I’ve stopped wearing it. </seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women haven’t stopped completely, but they feel that they’re in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days. </seg>
<seg id="1518">For many of the women, this discussion club is a safe space where they can share their opinions and aspirations. </seg>
<seg id="1519">“We make an excursion out of each discussion club. </seg>
<seg id="1520">We usually pack lunch and water and go to the field. </seg>
<seg id="1521">I don’t want the women to worry about who might hear what,” she says. </seg>
<seg id="1522">In the past few months, they have celebrated birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they have danced and sung and talked about things they have never given a second thought to. </seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says: </seg>
<seg id="1524">I have worked on these issues for so many years and even I haven’t talked about some of these things, like how our identities are tied to our husbands’, this honestly. </seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say some things out loud, no matter how small they seem. </seg>
<seg id="1526">At one discussion club, we were talking about the concept of honour and how it is related to clothes. </seg>
<seg id="1527">Many women in the group haven’t worn anything but saris since they got married. </seg>
<seg id="1528">Most are fine with it but some wanted to wear a salwar-kurta; they didn’t dare. </seg>
<seg id="1529">After much debating and discussion on the merits of choosing your own clothes, the morality related to saris and so on, Rohini smuggled her own set of kurtas (upper garments) to a discussion club so that the women could wear them. </seg>
<seg id="1530">The women have now decided to plan a trip to Goa so that they can wear jeans, and Rohini is certain that she can pull it off. </seg>
<seg id="1531">Asked whether things have changed in the five months since the first discussion club, Rohini explains how a wheel is beginning to turn: </seg>
<seg id="1532">Our steps have been small. </seg>
<seg id="1533">Many women tried it a few times but then they stopped saying their husband’s name. </seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it but only when they are alone and no other family member is around. </seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say their husbands’ names; now only one or two women wear vermilion on their forehead all the time. </seg>

<seg id="1549">This year on June 29 the hashtag ビートルズ記念日 (Beatles Memorial Day) trended on Japanese Twitter, as many fans shared their memories and appreciation of the Beatles. </seg>
<seg id="1550">The 1966 visit by the Beatles to Japan is regarded as a turning point in Japanese postwar culture. </seg>
<seg id="1551">Hoshika Rumiko, the first Japanese journalist to carry out an exclusive interview with the Beatles in London in 1964, remarked in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit: </seg>
<seg id="1552">The Beatles were only in the country for a little under five days, but that short visit was enough to change public opinion totally. </seg>
<seg id="1553">People soon realized that they had no choice but to embrace the Beatles. </seg>
<seg id="1554">Many of the giants of Japanese industry today came of age when the Beatles first came to Japan in 1966. </seg>
<seg id="1555">As reported by Nikkei Asian Review, according to Ryuichi Isaka, president of retail giant Seven &amp; i Holdings, the Beatles' music is "more of a universal language than English." </seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! ♬ It's Beatles Memorial Day in Japan. 🎶🎸 It's been 51 years since they came to Tokyo. </seg>

<seg id="1583">Police in Zambézia warn the population that bald men in Mozambique could be the target of attacks. </seg>
<seg id="1584">Photo: Anders Bolin/Flickr, CC-BY-NC 2.0 </seg>
<seg id="1585">A new phenomenon of kidnapping bald people for organ trafficking, reportedly for superstitious reasons, is worrying the police in Mozambique’s Zambézia province, whose government launched a series of operations to curb the practice. </seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of June, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the Malawian border. </seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found decapitated and with parts of his organs removed. </seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs were to be used by witch doctors in Tanzania and Malawi. </seg>
<seg id="1589">The motive behind the killings is local superstitions which hold that the head of a bald man contains gold or can bring riches, a Zambézia’s police spokesperson told the BBC. </seg>
<seg id="1590">This is the first time bald men have been the subject of recorded attacks in Mozambique. </seg>
<seg id="1591">But there have been other instances in the country where killings motivated by dark magic have been reported, particularly affecting albino people. </seg>
<seg id="1592">The situation became so dire that the United Nations was compelled to conduct a mission in 2016 to investigate the practice in the Southeast African nation. </seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism has been reported in other countries in Southern Africa, in particular neighbouring Tanzania, where the government has been developing campaigns to combat superstition and prejudice and arresting suspects. </seg>
<seg id="1594">In Mozambique, some people took to social media to discuss this latest attacks against bald men in the country. </seg>
<seg id="1595">Ukombe Weya, a resident of the city of Maputo, gave a warning to those intending to travel there. </seg>
<seg id="1596">Warning for bald men travelling to Mozambique Bald men in Mozambique are being targeted by ritual attacks, the Mozambican police warned, after the recent killing of three bald men for body parts. </seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the central district of Milange, where the murders happened. </seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, a student living in the city of Inhambane, in southern Mozambique, said that the local police were already dealing with the case: </seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes witch doctors are involved in the death of bald men. </seg>
<seg id="1600">The tracking and murder of bald individuals for the theft and sale of their organs, in Morrumbala district, Zambézia province, for presumed superstitious rituals, has cultural motivations and is ordered by traditional healers, the Police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM) believes, which also indicates the existence of a belief that the victims have, in the head, some power which generates wealth. </seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with problems with baldness were killed in that part of the country. </seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook a report by the blogger Armen Snaippa, who suggested that the issue is part of the larger social challenges affecting Mozambique: </seg>
<seg id="1603">I WOULD LIKE A MOZAMBIQUE WITH A SENSE OF SHAME A country where people were ashamed to go outside dressed as if it was a porn movie shoot, where the teachers were ashamed to ask for sex in exchange for grades and the students were ashamed to offer sex for grades, jobs, and other benefits, a nation where the people looked for honest jobs and did not have to hurt or even take the lives of others to earn their bread, a country where neither albinos nor bald people were hunted for dark practices or “black magic” aimed at easy enrichment. </seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the events, some did not miss the chance for a bit of macabre humor. </seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Angola and Mozambique, and an avid Twitter user, took to the platform to point out that the Morrumbala district chief Pedro Sapange and Zambezia police spokesman Inácio Dina were both bald. </seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, believed to have been taken recently. </seg>
<seg id="1627">This story originally appeared on Hong Kong Free Press on July 8, 2017. </seg>
<seg id="1628">The version below is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement. </seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted the attention of the international community after his lawyer revealed in late June that he had been hospitalized with terminal liver cancer. </seg>
<seg id="1630">Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009 for “subversion” after drafting Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China. </seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1632">China’s Foreign Ministry has called Liu’s case “an internal affair” and a spokesperson said he did not see “any need to discuss it with any other country.” </seg>
<seg id="1633">But China continues to face calls from the international community to release the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or allow him to receive treatment abroad. </seg>
<seg id="1634">Whilst some countries have criticised Beijing’s treatment of the couple, others have evaded the topic. </seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has gathered some of the international reactions. </seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations </seg>
<seg id="1637">The UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Liu’s case. </seg>
<seg id="1638">But a spokesperson declined to comment as to whether the UN was pushing for Liu to be treated abroad. </seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway </seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions over Liu’s release. </seg>
<seg id="1641">China froze diplomatic ties with Norway after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government said it had nothing to do with the decision. </seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year, and Norway signed a deal to resume salmon exports to China in June, as exports had remained largely blocked since 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1643">After news broke that Liu was seriously ill, the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed hope for his unconditional release and invited him to visit Oslo to receive his prize. </seg>
<seg id="1644">He was unable to collect his award as he was imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1645">At the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair. </seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union </seg>
<seg id="1647">On July 6, the European Parliament passed a resolution asking China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical treatment wherever he wishes. </seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also urged China to release Liu in a statement on June 30: </seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to remove all limitations on the movements of Mr Liu’s wife and family members. </seg>
<seg id="1650">They must be able to meet and receive visits from whomever they desire, and be able to freely communicate with the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="1651">United States </seg>
<seg id="1652">US Ambassador Terry Branstad has said that Americans “would like to see him have the opportunity for treatment elsewhere, if that could be any of help.” </seg>
<seg id="1653">A US embassy in China spokeswoman, Mary Beth Polley, told AFP on June 27 that the embassy was calling on the Chinese authorities to not only release Liu but also to release Liu Xia from house arrest. </seg>
<seg id="1654">The embassy’s remark prompted an angry response from China, with its foreign ministry saying that “no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs.” </seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley said China should provide the couple with: </seg>
<seg id="1656">protection and freedom such as freedom of movement and access to medical care of his choosing, to which they are entitled under the Chinese constitution and legal system and international commitments. </seg>
<seg id="1657">US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley, and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife. </seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany </seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said on July 3 that Berlin hopes Liu will get “all the medical support he needs” and that a “humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority”. </seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared at a G20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8. </seg>
<seg id="1662">Diplomatic sources in Beijing previously told Reuters that China has been nervous that concerns over Liu could overshadow the visit. </seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada </seg>
<seg id="1664">Canadian Ambassador John McCallum urged China on June 28 to ensure that Liu receives suitable medical care and is reunited with his family. </seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu’s lawyer previously told AFP that Liu’s wife Liu Xia is able to visit him every day, but police are always posted inside the hospital room, and Liu is not able to contact anyone in the outside world, including his lawyers. </seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum said in his statement: </seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release those imprisoned for exercising those rights. </seg>
<seg id="1668">France </seg>
<seg id="1669">France’s foreign ministry called on China to free Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on June 29: </seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatment he needs where he wishes and that his wife and family are able to have access to him. </seg>
<seg id="1671">Though France Info previously reported that the French government would welcome Liu, the foreign ministry said it had no further comment on whether it would host him. </seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan </seg>
<seg id="1673">Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council urged China on June 27 to free Liu and show greater tolerance toward those who use peaceful means to call for political reform and democratic development. </seg>
<seg id="1674">Taiwanese lawmaker Yu Mei-nu, of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also urged China to allow the ailing intellectual to go to Taiwan for treatment. </seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama </seg>
<seg id="1676">Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama expressed his concern for Liu in a statement on June 28, saying that many have asked him to pray for Liu’s well-being. </seg>
<seg id="1677">He said of Liu: </seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took, and for which he has been severely punished, would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world. </seg>
<seg id="1679">I was personally moved as well as encouraged when hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and concerned citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed Charter 08 calling for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China. </seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: Is it a city or country? &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Public Domain </seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country? </seg>
<seg id="1684">This question seems silly since Singapore is globally recognized as an independent state. </seg>
<seg id="1685">But for Singapore Law Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be treated as a city. </seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere. </seg>
<seg id="1687">In his lecture during a meeting of the New York State Bar Association International Section, Shanmugam observed that many people are criticizing the dominance of a single party in Singapore politics because they are comparing Singapore with other countries. </seg>
<seg id="1688">He insisted that Singapore should be judged as a city. </seg>
<seg id="1689">"…nobody questions whether there is a democracy in New York.... </seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different. </seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city. </seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country." </seg>
<seg id="1694">Cavalierio accused the Law Minister of “twisting logic” to justify authoritarian rule in Singapore: </seg>
<seg id="1695">And now, for all our efforts and sacrifices put into creating a precious piece of country, we are told that we are not a country after all. </seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded vulgar; sounded like a shirking of responsibility, like a dereliction of duty. </seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, who is? </seg>
<seg id="1698">Shanmugam’s motive was less lofty: he was arguing that Singapore’s political system shouldn’t be measured against the yardsticks of ‘a normal country’, where Singapore would invariably appear undemocratic. </seg>
<seg id="1699">Instead, he argued, Singapore should be compared to ‘cities’ like Chicago, San Fransisco, and New York City – cities that have enduring one-party rule. </seg>
<seg id="1700">Cities that are democratic. </seg>
<seg id="1701">Sometimes when we reach into the crux of the matter, we find that it is the old chestnut again. The old self-serving chestnut of authoritarian rulers pretending to be a democracy, twisting logic to suit one’s power. </seg>
<seg id="1702">So in the end, the answers that Shanmugam provided to his American guests last week, about our press, our judiciary, our political system, were non-answers really. </seg>
<seg id="1703">Pertinent questions explained away in a camouflage of rational non-responses. </seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng wants Shanmugam to elaborate his point since she couldn’t understand that line of thinking </seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find that a little difficult to swallow. </seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, then which country is our city part of…. </seg>
<seg id="1707">Well, I don’t get it. </seg>
<seg id="1708">I will really appreciate it if our dear K Shanmugam will kindly enlighten us here since he has been paid so much to play a part in the governing of Singapore city. </seg>
<seg id="1709">Commenting on this blogpost, Anon clarified that critics should first read the full transcript of Shanmugam’s lecture to appreciate the context of his assertion that Singapore is a city, not a country </seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript. </seg>
<seg id="1711">When he spoke about Singapore being a ‘city’ rather than ‘country’ he was explaining why elections in Singapore were so lopsided despite us holding free and fair elections. </seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA, and how many cities in the US had a single party dominating elections for decades. </seg>
<seg id="1713">While he did say that Singapore “isn’t a country”, he certainly didn’t mean it that way! </seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan is disappointed that Shanmugam, a leader from the new generation, would deliver a controversial argument like this: </seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very disturbed by what the Singapore Law Minister said... </seg>
<seg id="1716">At least with Lee Kuan Yew and members of the older guard, I knew what I could expect from them- whether or not I actually agree with them, is another issue. </seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugan, part of the newer generation of Singaporean political leaders, I'm not even sure if he actually believes, connects and knows what he's arguing for. </seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review dissects the loopholes of Shanmugam’s arguments </seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr Shanmugam make a “honest mistake” or a freudian slip? </seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is NOT a country, then are we still considered a sovereign and independent state? </seg>
<seg id="1721">So which country owns the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore? </seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique in the sense that it is both a country and a city at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1723">As an important minister in the Singapore cabinet, Mr Shanmugam’s words carry a lot of weight. </seg>
<seg id="1724">Why are Singapore males serving National Service when they are only defending a city and not their country? </seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our Prime Minister report to? </seg>
<seg id="1726">What value does our pink IC have? </seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or residents of a city? </seg>
<seg id="1728">The Journey of a Decade believes that yes, Singapore is and has always been a city: </seg>
<seg id="1729">Not say I say what.. </seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered quite abit of Singaporeans.... </seg>
<seg id="1731">Lets get this straight... no one said anything about Singapore being a country. </seg>
<seg id="1732">We have always been a city. </seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been an island city state. </seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand how we often we hear things like defending the country among others....it is not exactly correct. </seg>
<seg id="1735">It should be defending the city. </seg>

<seg id="1745">"Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature," is the standard reply to my clarification. A lot of Canadians might seeth inwardly at being mistaken for an American, but I don't mind. </seg>
<seg id="1746">To the untrained eye, there's very little to distinguish Canadians from Americans. </seg>

<seg id="1768">Number one: to be called "nice" is to essentially be called a square, much like the sweet, gentle but tragically ineffectual Ned Flanders character from "The Simpsons" (who has his own Canadian doppleganger). </seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada could in fact be a nation of Ned Flanderses, it would be an improvement, but the real problem is that nice doesn't have any personality. </seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no hard edges, and nothing pushes back. </seg>
<seg id="1771">To be inoffensive is to be unremarkable and uninteresting, unworthy of attention. </seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if your desire is to blend into the background, and remain aloof from what's going on around you. </seg>
<seg id="1773">I'd argue that the desire to remain unengaged and alone is in fact a primary characteristic of being Canadian. </seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to mind our own business. </seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders regard as being "nice" might actually be cold politeness. </seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't engage much in over-the-fence conversations with neighbours. </seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness I've come to associate with my American friends. </seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau showed up to make being Canadian more than just nice: our prime minister has made our country positively sexy. </seg>
<seg id="1779">Pop Band's Music Video Parodies Junta Rule in Thailand &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="1780">A famous pop band in Thailand has released a music video parodying the junta that grabbed power in 2014 and continues to govern the country despite its pledge to restore civilian rule. </seg>
<seg id="1781">The Tattoo Colour band’s new song ‘Dictator Girl’ (Phadet Girl) is about a young man narrating the rules set for him by his girl. </seg>
<seg id="1782">While not explicitly about politics, the music video made indirect reference to the continuing military rule. </seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by fans and other Internet users for its bravery in depicting the country’s situation. </seg>
<seg id="1784">The song’s video immediately went viral. </seg>
<seg id="1785">As of this writing, the video uploaded on Facebook has already garnered 1,254 shares and 8,800 likes. </seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even a Charlie Chaplin video clip, ‘The Dictator’ was blocked in Thailand after an activist group encouraged the public to watch it. </seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and fun introduction to Thai politics, especially the country’s situation under Junta rule. </seg>
<seg id="1788">Consider these images in the video that alluded to some of the political issues that have dogged Thailand over the past three years. </seg>
<seg id="1789">The ‘44 rules by girl’ can be referring to the draconian Section 44 of the Interim Constitution which gave the army chief absolute powers to decide on important national issues. </seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: ‘Adjust your Attitude’, is about the infamous ‘attitude-adjustment’ sessions given by the army to journalists, students, scholars, activists, politicians, and others perceived to be critical of the junta. </seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the implementation of the Computer Crimes Act whose vague and overbroad provisions are often used by authorities to detain activists and other critics of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1792">An army unit was set up to monitor online content and prosecute individuals accused of defaming the monarchy. </seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand enforces a strict Lese Majeste (anti-Royal Insult) law. </seg>
<seg id="1794">On May 20, 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, the army staged a coup. </seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the issues hounding the junta is its decision to buy expensive submarines despite security analysts warning the purchase was unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers’ money. </seg>
<seg id="1797">Even the case of individuals kidnapped and thrown inside a black van before being sent to detention camps was depicted in the video. </seg>
<seg id="1798">Media continues to face serious restrictions; some journalists have been jailed for allegedly causing "confusion" in society, and Internet users face long prison terms if they insult the monarchy. </seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the promotional teaser of the song featured members of the band doing the 'Hunger Games' salute which was used by anti-coup activists during protest actions in 2014. </seg>

<seg id="1801">Photo by Dmitry Stateynov for OC Media. </seg>
<seg id="1802">Used with permission </seg>
<seg id="1803">The following is a version of a partner post written by Dmitri Stateynov that first appeared on the website OC Media. </seg>
<seg id="1804">The post-war recovery has been slow to arrive in eastern Abkhazia, particularly in the district of Tkuarchal. </seg>
<seg id="1805">More than 20 years have passed since the Georgian–Abkhaz war officially ended, but its scars still bear a heavy imprint in this part of the republic. </seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of upper Tkuarchal District cut striking images. </seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana, and Kharchilava are located in Abkhazia’s coal basin. </seg>
<seg id="1808">During the Soviet period, different ethnic groups lived and worked together in the area; Russians, Greeks, Abkhaz, Georgians, and Armenians. </seg>
<seg id="1809">Most of them abandoned their homes during the war. </seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, mostly Russians and Abkhaz live here. </seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are known in Abkhazia as ‘ghost towns’. </seg>
<seg id="1812">If their pre-war populations topped 10,000, today, only a few hundred people live in them. </seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is symptomatic in Tkuarchal. </seg>
<seg id="1814">As of 2011, the district's entire population was 16,000, having barely risen for over a decade. </seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, approximately 43,000 people lived in the district. </seg>

<seg id="1818">‘All of this is a consequence of the war’ </seg>
<seg id="1819">The emptied five-storey Soviet-era apartment blocks dating back to the early 1960s &#8212; Khrushchyovkas &#8212; stand as symbols of the region's decline and desolation. </seg>
<seg id="1820">The buildings are decaying and it is rare that more than two families inhabit them. </seg>
<seg id="1821">Photo by Dmitry Stateynov for OC Media. </seg>
<seg id="1822">Used with permission. </seg>
<seg id="1823">At the entrance to the village of Dzhantukha, I meet a local resident, an elderly man. </seg>
<seg id="1824">He starts a conversation that he does not want to finish. </seg>
<seg id="1825">"All of this is the consequence of the war." </seg>
<seg id="1826">"Can I talk with you?" </seg>
<seg id="1827">"Why talk? </seg>
<seg id="1828">Everything is clear anyway." </seg>
<seg id="1829">Before the war, life in the village was vibrant, with community centres, schools, and kindergartens all serving the community. </seg>
<seg id="1830">Now, cobbled streets host buildings of faded magnificence. </seg>
<seg id="1831">The people that once lived in this place, and made their contribution to the Soviet Union's centrally planned economy, have now left. </seg>
<seg id="1832">In one ghost town, Dzhantukha, there are about fifty inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="1833">Some 38 live in Akarmara, with similar numbers in the other villages. </seg>
<seg id="1834">Those khrushchyovkas that still contain one or two families are marked out by the laundry drying on their balconies. </seg>
<seg id="1835">Two young girls, both aged seven, peek out from the window of a ruined house. </seg>
<seg id="1836">Upon noticing the camera in my hands, they immediately turn away. </seg>
<seg id="1837">‘Our mother forbade us to be photographed’, one of them says. </seg>
<seg id="1838">‘Why?’ ‘She forbade it and that is all’. </seg>
<seg id="1839">The girl whispers something to her friend and they abruptly exit the ruined building and disappear. </seg>
<seg id="1840">Most people in the area work for a small Turkish coal mining firm, Tkuarchalugol. </seg>
<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in subsistence farming; cattle-breeding, bee-keeping, vegetable-growing. </seg>
<seg id="1842">It is hard to make ends meet. </seg>
<seg id="1843">In winter, the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages. </seg>

<seg id="1846">"I don’t know what will happen, but we will plant zucchini" </seg>
<seg id="1847">About ten years ago, an elderly woman named Galina, or as her neighbours call her, Aunt Galya, moved to Dzhantukha from Akarmara. </seg>
<seg id="1848">Despite her eldest daughter living in France, Galina does not intend to leave Abkhazia to live with her. "My heart draws me to Abkhazia," she says. </seg>
<seg id="1849">Galina refuses offers of financial help from her daughter, insisting that she provide for her young grandchildren instead. </seg>
<seg id="1850">Galina's monthly pension is the equivalent of just nine dollars. </seg>
<seg id="1851">"If you don’t have a vegetable garden and a house, you can't survive," she admits. </seg>
<seg id="1852">Aunt Galya says that she and other residents of the village try to meet up regularly and celebrate holidays together. </seg>

<seg id="1856">When there are holidays, we visit each other. </seg>
<seg id="1857">But we can’t always &#8212; everyone is busy with their own affairs." </seg>
<seg id="1858">As she is talking, a younger neighbour walks out onto the balcony. </seg>
<seg id="1859">"Natasha", Aunt Galya calls out to her. "They said that we can plant zucchini. </seg>
<seg id="1860">I already prepared the ground. </seg>
<seg id="1861">I don’t know what will happen, but we will plant zucchini." </seg>
<seg id="1862">‘People get used to everything’ </seg>
<seg id="1863">Galya's conversant, Natasha, has lived together with her husband and five children in her house for some time. </seg>
<seg id="1864">Natasha was 11-years-old when the war began. </seg>
<seg id="1865">Every day she recalls village life before the war. </seg>
<seg id="1866">Despite having relatives living in central Russia, Ossetia, and Georgia &#8212; the country Abkhazia broke away from &#8212; they have not had the opportunity to leave. </seg>

<seg id="1869">"We recently bought land in (Abkhazia's administrative capital) Sukhumi. </seg>
<seg id="1870">We want to build a house there, but this won’t happen any time soon," she says ruefully. </seg>
<seg id="1871">Natasha receives a child allowance of roughly $9 for each child. </seg>
<seg id="1872">Her husband works at the coal pit. </seg>
<seg id="1873">The young family has its own farm. </seg>
<seg id="1874">Near the house, where the kindergarten Natasha attended as a child once stood, they keep pigs, cows, cocks and hens. </seg>
<seg id="1875">She says that when people started leaving the village after the war, it was scary at first. </seg>

<seg id="1882">In fact, it’s all due to looting. </seg>

<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez, also known as "Mama Africa," runs a small hotel in Tapachula, a small city in Mexico, in the southern state of Chiapas, just across the border from Guatemala. </seg>
<seg id="1896">Credit: Amy Bracken </seg>
<seg id="1897">This story by Amy Bracken originally appeared on PRI.org on April 19, 2017. It is republished here as part of a partnership between PRI and Global Voices. </seg>
<seg id="1898">For migrants, whether moving through Europe or Latin America, certain spots become known along the way for welcoming people. </seg>
<seg id="1899">I visit one such place in the Mexican city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. </seg>
<seg id="1900">It’s a bare-bones hotel near downtown. </seg>
<seg id="1901">The manager is a petite, 59-year-old Mexican woman with coral pink glasses and gold-colored teddy bear earrings. </seg>
<seg id="1902">Her name is Concepción González Ramírez, and she was born and raised here in Tapachula, but many now know her as Mama Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1903">She’s called that because the hotel — actually she herself — has become a destination for Africans, as well as Haitians, passing through. </seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel isn’t that charming. </seg>
<seg id="1905">For $2.50 a night, guests stay in basic rooms with peeling, bare walls and metal-frame beds. </seg>
<seg id="1906">In the lobby, there’s a parrot in a cage. </seg>
<seg id="1907">There’s no sign for the hotel, but African and Haitian migrants by the hundreds have found their way here. </seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ramírez says, people arrive in packed minibuses at the top of the road, “and start yelling out, ‘Mama Africa! </seg>
<seg id="1909">Where’s Mama Africa?!’" </seg>
<seg id="1910">There’s a lull now, but earlier this year Ramirez had 200 guests at a time. </seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, so some people slept on cardboard outside. </seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn’t want to turn anyone away. </seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps out by taking sick guests to the hospital, buying medicine they can’t afford, and rubbing balm on travel-weary feet. </seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, from Angola, arrived recently. </seg>
<seg id="1915">I ask him if Mama Africa is a fitting nickname for Ramírez. </seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with their girl, Merrui, sporting a with the yogurt mustache) stand with Concepción González Ramírez, also known as Mama Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1917">The Sebastiaos came from Angola via Brazil, and they hope to reach Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1918">Credit: Amy Bracken </seg>
<seg id="1919">“Yes, yes,” he says, with a laugh. “I feel she is really like that, because African women are very nice women. </seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving. </seg>
<seg id="1921">She has a mother’s gregariousness. ... </seg>
<seg id="1922">We’re really comfortable here.” </seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is traveling with his sister and her three children, hoping to get to Boston to reunite with her husband. </seg>
<seg id="1924">They’d been living in Brazil already, but for some Africans a popular route to the US is to first fly to South America and then head north. </seg>
<seg id="1925">They heard about Mama Africa from fellow travelers. “Mama Africa is a name that’s known all along the route,” says Felix Michelet, a guest here from Haiti. </seg>
<seg id="1926">He says Haitians and Africans often travel together, and Africans farther ahead on the route had sent back word about Ramírez via Whatsapp. </seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many Haitians, Michelet lived in Brazil, working construction ahead of the Olympics and the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="1928">After Brazil’s economy weakened, he began making his way to the US. </seg>
<seg id="1929">He’s been at Mama Africa’s for months, selling SIM cards to make enough money for the bus to Tijuana. </seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask if he’ll stay in touch with Ramirez. </seg>
<seg id="1931">“Mama Africa is our mom, we’re never going to let her go,” he says with a laugh. “We’ll always be in touch.” </seg>
<seg id="1932">Ramírez says former guests often text her, saying hello or reporting progress on their trip. </seg>
<seg id="1933">She says her work is motivated by her Christian faith. </seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn’t know much about Africa, but she has learned from guests how to make Ghanaian-style chicken. </seg>
<seg id="1935">Ramírez might be famous around here, but she’s not the only beacon for migrants in Tapachula. </seg>
<seg id="1936">Across town, a dirt road dead-ends at Jesús Valenzuela’s house. </seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family made space in their small home for guests. </seg>
<seg id="1938">He’s a local cop, and he saw African migrants were being overcharged for bus tickets. </seg>
<seg id="1939">He started helping them get a fair deal, and offered up his home for a buck a night. </seg>
<seg id="1940">Now, up to 25 people, mostly Haitian, are staying here. </seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on quilts on the floor, but there’s electricity, laundry, and an outdoor cooking area. </seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela says he knows what his guests go through. </seg>
<seg id="1943">“I was in the United States,” he says. “I’ve experienced what they’re experiencing. </seg>
<seg id="1944">I went through the desert, and we suffered. </seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help, and places where they don’t, so that’s why I want to support and help them.” </seg>
<seg id="1946">After three years in the US, Valenzuela was deported following a workplace raid. </seg>
<seg id="1947">Most migrants coming through Tapachula are Central American, and some locals open their doors to them too. </seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me he fled extortionists in Honduras with his wife and three children — and no plan. </seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked around about housing, and a stranger — a single mom — took them in. </seg>
<seg id="1950">Months have gone by and the family is still in her house, trying to figure out their next move. </seg>
<seg id="1951">Back at Mama Africa’s, the rooms are full again. </seg>
<seg id="1952">In the halls, travelers quietly study their cell phones. </seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus came by today and unloaded 20 new guests, mostly from Somalia. </seg>
<seg id="1954">Ramírez seems happy with the fuller house, but she’s also nostalgic for those who’ve gone. </seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she scrolls through her digital photo album.. </seg>
<seg id="1956">There’s a picture of her daughter with her hair cornrowed by a guest, some shots of grandchildren, and many more of travelers, young and old. </seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly through her brief introductions. </seg>
<seg id="1958">“Ya se fueron,” she says, repeatedly. “They’ve left.” </seg>
<seg id="1959">China's Xinjiang Residents Are Being Forced to Install Surveillance Apps on Mobile Phones &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="1960">A personal communication device check point in Xinjiang via Twitter user 即时中国大陆映像 </seg>
<seg id="1961">Residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region of western China, are being forced to install spyware on their mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi City received a mobile phone notification from the district government instructing them to install a surveillance application called Jingwang (or "Web Cleansing"). </seg>
<seg id="1963">The message said the app was intended to "prevent from accessing terrorist information." </seg>
<seg id="1964">But authorities may be using the app for more than just counter-terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women from Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture were arrested for messages sent to a private WeChat group chat soon after they installed the app. </seg>
<seg id="1966">The notification from police said the application would locate and track the sources and distribution paths of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activity and "harmful information," including videos, images, ebooks and documents. </seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the application as follows: </seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with an adult and child categorization system introduced by Jiangsu Telecom. </seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is to block pornographic websites, online scams, trojan horses, and phishing sites; to alert users of how much time they spend online; and to enable remote control of one's home network. </seg>
<seg id="1970">The tool is intended to help kids develop a healthy lifestyle by building a safe web filter for the minors. </seg>
<seg id="1971">Of course, any tool with these capabilities could be used in multiple ways. </seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the app's "remote control" feature could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal from a person's home network. </seg>
<seg id="1973">The move is consistent with other measures of control over digital activities in the region. </seg>
<seg id="1974">While stories of digital censorship in China often focus on the experiences of users in major cities in the east and south, the reality is often more bleak for those living in remote, embattled ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet. </seg>
<seg id="1975">Seeking to contain unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often impose extreme censorship and surveillance measures and routine Internet shutdowns. </seg>
<seg id="1976">A Twitter-based media outlet, “Images from mainland China” (即时中国大陆映像), which covers censored news in China, posted photos taken from a checkpoint where police officers randomly checked residents to see if they have installed the surveillance app: </seg>
<seg id="1977">Authorities from Xinjiang are checking to make sure that people are using the official Jingwang application. </seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded people install the app within 10 days. </seg>
<seg id="1979">If they are caught at a checkpoint and their devices do not have the software, they could be detained for 10 days. </seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback on the development of technology. </seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced people to use devices designed for the elderly. </seg>
<seg id="1982">It is a form of confinement by through surveillance technology. </seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back to Mao's China. </seg>
<seg id="1984">“Images from mainland China” (即时中国大陆映像) also posted a product description of Jingwang which explained that the tool can negate the password requirement of a Windows operating system and access the computer hard disk with no restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="1985">Once installed with Jingwang, computers and mobiles in Xinjiang, would become electronic handcuffs. </seg>
<seg id="1986">The Jingwang requirement may be a response to the city party committee’s instruction to crack down on the distribution of illegal content. </seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches and government and party affiliated institutions, including universities and research organizations, are obligated to follow instructions from the Cybersecurity Office on managing their computer and communication networks. </seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report from Freedom House, a US-based human rights group, also touched on the new surveillance practices: </seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, authorities in a district of the regional capital Urumqi issued a notice on June 27 instructing all residents and business owners to submit their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebook computers, and media storage cards" to the local police post for "registration and scanning" by August 1. </seg>
<seg id="1990">The goal is ostensibly to identify and purge any "terrorist videos," but the action violates the privacy rights of Urumqi's three million residents and exposes them to punishment for a host of other possible offenses, including those related to peaceful religious or political expression. </seg>

<seg id="2006">And for the first time it was quiet, idle, when it shouldn’t have been—even though I never expected much from a city packed with regime security branches and their accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="2007">The third night. Things became quiet after the main electricity supply unit of the neighborhood was disabled. </seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke the silence shouting “Allahu Akbar” several times from the rooftop of my house. </seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice echo through the silence. </seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, friends felt safe enough to join me. </seg>
<seg id="2011">I wasn’t alone. </seg>
<seg id="2012">There were many friends, real friends who joined me; together we formed a beautiful image that lived up to my expectations. </seg>
<seg id="2013">At that moment you realize that you’re letting the genie out, but you just don’t care. </seg>
<seg id="2014">A call from my father: “Get ready—we meet at the Military Security Branch”. </seg>
<seg id="2015">The call ended. </seg>
<seg id="2016">I discovered then that no matter how much honey you swallow, nothing can bring your voice back after such full-throated shouting, before you reach a security branch. </seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there. </seg>
<seg id="2018">Colonel Ghassan was sitting with several of his men, my father and now me. </seg>
<seg id="2019">Colonel Ghassan starts talking: “Let me hear you shouting 'Allahu Akbar', or are you only brave enough to do it when you’re away from us?” </seg>
<seg id="2020">His eyes were fixed on me, dripping hatred. </seg>
<seg id="2021">“And you have the guts to look me in the eye instead of looking at the floor!”. </seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then wasn’t out of courage. </seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18, visiting the same branch office for the fourth time. </seg>
<seg id="2024">It was probably foolishness, vanity or revolution. </seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so confident answering: “I didn’t expect you’d forget my voice since yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="2026">And I don’t think I ever stopped looking you in the eye, so why today?” </seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest conversation that could ever bring as much suffering as it did to me afterwards—despite that, I don’t regret it. </seg>
<seg id="2028">“Throw him into solitary, and take his father back to solitary too”. </seg>
<seg id="2029">“Take his father back to solitary”. </seg>
<seg id="2030">That stinking sentence, the stench of which lingers in my nose to this day. </seg>
<seg id="2031">It became a ‘syndrome’ that tortured me mentally for months. </seg>
<seg id="2032">I cross the yard. </seg>
<seg id="2033">First office is where I leave my belongings. </seg>
<seg id="2034">I return to the yard and go into the second office, which precedes the corridor to the solitary cells. </seg>
<seg id="2035">I memorize it fully before going in. </seg>
<seg id="2036">It seems like my cell is going to be larger this time, unlike the ones I’m usually given. </seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with only one other inmate, and I can sit immediately without having to wait my turn as I customarily have to do. </seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes which felt like a lifetime, the officer left the cell, and I used the known communication method of tapping the wall with my fist. </seg>
<seg id="2039">I could tell he was a “first-timer”. </seg>
<seg id="2040">After long hesitation he answered me. </seg>
<seg id="2041">Neither of the solitary cells near me seem to have a distinguished, middle-aged man who looks like me and is called The Doctor. </seg>
<seg id="2042">My face has no features in this total darkness, and there are no doctors here; we are all numbers. </seg>
<seg id="2043">“Perhaps he sounds like me??” </seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers deny his existence. </seg>
<seg id="2045">Maybe they took him to the big cells. </seg>
<seg id="2046">Maybe they took him to interrogation immediately. </seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator assured me they would release him if I stayed. </seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars. </seg>
<seg id="2049">I wish I could find a scarecrow to scare away all those crows feasting on the orchard of my head. </seg>
<seg id="2050">I hear the shouts of Allahu Akbar in the distance. </seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be 10 pm, the time at which the shouts occur each day. </seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens. </seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black was the color of doom until I saw the yellow light of the corridor which brought us the horrible Raad. </seg>
<seg id="2054">“Out for interrogation”. </seg>
<seg id="2055">Now I figured out the secret: to protect the security of the State from us and prevent us from unleashing the traitor and the terrorist living inside us, they speak in an Alawite dialect, their sectarian blackmail card and the narrow angle from which they view life. </seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a home, this is not a country, it’s a curse they call co-existence in order to make the criminal of their clan a hero. </seg>
<seg id="2057">I enter the interrogation room to find Abu Imad with his slim short body, at least to me. </seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts his “friendly” conversation despite the facial expressions he can’t hide: “Son, you’re still young, you can make many things out of your life, things that are more important than hanging out with vagabonds going out in protests that will die out soon”. </seg>
<seg id="2059">I kept my silence. </seg>
<seg id="2060">I have memorized this by heart. </seg>
<seg id="2061">I don’t really remember when receiving a friendly talk followed by insults and beating became a normal way of communication to me. </seg>
<seg id="2062">I didn’t care much about when and how. </seg>
<seg id="2063">Something inside told me to get used to receiving punishment in spite of not having done anything wrong to justify it. </seg>
<seg id="2064">To get used to receiving punishment in all forms. </seg>
<seg id="2065">He has orders to remove as much of my flesh as he can. </seg>
<seg id="2066">He likes to call them “confessions”. </seg>
<seg id="2067">He starts with a plastic tube, probably used for sewage work. </seg>
<seg id="2068">Your tormentor enjoys your screams. </seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him his joy, you’re no match, and your screams cannot be contained. </seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams did not please him enough, so he exchanged the tube for a cable. </seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first detention I wondered if the investigator used to work in junk collection or if this was equipment that came with the job. </seg>
<seg id="2072">A thick power cable made out of four cables braided together to give us this great invention, in their eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2073">It was just an hour, during which three of them took turns, while I stayed on the same shift. </seg>
<seg id="2074">My body grew numb and I lost my voice so I couldn’t scream anymore. </seg>
<seg id="2075">He felt the coldness and didn’t like it, so he poked me with an electrical prod. </seg>
<seg id="2076">An electric current ran through my body. An electric current that would be enough to re-power my neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body lying on the floor was a perfect conductor. </seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness is gone and the pain is back. </seg>
<seg id="2079">Two horrible hours after which he decided to call it a night. </seg>
<seg id="2080">I guess it was around midnight. </seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to go back to sleep, or let’s say it was my only choice. </seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed; to me they felt like minutes. </seg>
<seg id="2083">The call for morning prayers. </seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the doom light shines in. “Outside, you bugger”. </seg>
<seg id="2085">I answer in my exhausted teenager’s voice: “Sir, my father must be worried sick”. </seg>
<seg id="2086">“Shut up and move, you’re getting transferred.” </seg>
<seg id="2087">This was a first. </seg>
<seg id="2088">On the previous occasions it was a release from prison. </seg>
<seg id="2089">Where are they taking me?! </seg>
<seg id="2090">Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib Talks About LGBTQ+ Rights, Freedom of Expression, and Resistance &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio. </seg>
<seg id="2092">Photo taken by the author. </seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors, lazily vacillating from his canvas, to his computer, and occasionally to his couch. </seg>
<seg id="2094">Always, however, one can either find a cigarette dangling between his fingers or resting between his nicotine-stained lips. </seg>
<seg id="2095">He resides on the top floor of his family’s home which they have owned since 1967—the year Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and the year in which Hdaib’s family was forced to flee their village in Palestine where they lived as “felahyeen”, or farmers. </seg>
<seg id="2096">For the last six years, Hdaib has been a vocal activist, challenging Jordan’s conservative majority and its long-held assumptions on gender, sexuality, and freedom of expression through artwork and rap music. </seg>
<seg id="2097">He has also challenged Arab society to its core with music that so often focuses on Orientalism, Palestinian refugee-hood, and racism—all issues that affect not just his home city of Amman but cities that span from Syria's Damascus all the way to Yemen's Sanaa. </seg>
<seg id="2098">As a 25-year old, Hdaib views himself as someone who isn't constricted by borders, claiming that he empathizes with the suffering of those facing devastating foreign interventions in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya. </seg>
<seg id="2099">Although he won’t say it, he has a particular aversion to U.S. foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his artwork in his Amman based studio. </seg>
<seg id="2101">Photo taken by the author. </seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib denies that his ability to resonate with those hanging on in war zones has anything to do with his identity as a “second generation Palestinian refugee,”—a term he employs to describe his own identity despite being born in Jordan and despite never having visited Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="2103">“I don’t feel this way because of my circumstances,” he insists. </seg>
<seg id="2104">“I feel like that because I’m human,” Hdaib says as he pours watered down Nescafe into two cups during the holy month of Ramadan during which Muslims are supposed to abstain from consuming food from sunrise to sunset. </seg>
<seg id="2105">Jordanian law also mandates that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal. </seg>
<seg id="2106">It is obvious that Hdaib has an affinity for defying age-old traditions, but drinking coffee on a scorching June day isn't so much about defying Islam. </seg>
<seg id="2107">On a more fundamental level, sipping on the lukewarm watered coffee and repeatedly inhaling the fumes from a Kent cigarette is more about breaking free. </seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes it feels like Jordan is an open air prison especially when you think of visiting the nearest countries to it. </seg>
<seg id="2109">So you just avoid doing very basic rights like drinking water in public when it’s Ramadan not to be jailed. </seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, Jordan’s Interior Ministry cancelled Lebanese band Mashrou' Leila’s upcoming performance, marking it as the second occasion such a decision was made by the government. </seg>
<seg id="2111">Parliamentarians aligned with the Islamic Action Front, the Jordanian offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, argued that the band’s lead singer’s sexual orientation - the lead singer, Hamed Sinno, is openly gay - was contrary to the cultural and traditional norms of the country and was the primary reason for the cancellation. </seg>
<seg id="2112">Member of Parliament Dima Tahboub, and former spokeswoman for the Islamist coalition, told CNN that the singer’s sexuality was “exactly” the reason the event was cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="2113">Many have also alleged that the band’s commitment to the Arab Spring, human rights, and to freedom of expression for Arabs stands as dangerous advocacy which threatens the long enshrined legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region. </seg>
<seg id="2114">In a statement released to the public, Mashrou Leila deemed the Jordanian people “progressive supporters of human rights” who remain committed to “intellectual and cultural pluralism.” </seg>
<seg id="2115">The band’s statement may not simply be rhetorical fluff, but may actually reflect a growing on-the-ground reality in Jordan, as Hdaib’s work clearly shows. </seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib challenged gender norms by depicting what in his view was the plight of Arab Women if they had engaged in sexual activity before marriage. </seg>
<seg id="2117">The image portrays an unnamed skeleton woman who appears to be trampled and whose limbs are extended into every corner of the canvas. </seg>
<seg id="2118">Around her is a sea of red, which presumably reflects the blood of the countless women who have lost their life to violence inflicted by those they are supposed to trust. </seg>
<seg id="2119">The practice of 'honor killings' - or at least, the recorded ones - in Jordan increased in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, not only did honor killings reach a zenith in 2016, but Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure needed to properly take care of its women who are survivors of attempted murder or domestic assault. </seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 Crime Prevention law, at-risk women can be “indefinitely detained” and their release often requires years of bureaucratic procedures and assurances from the family that the woman will not be placed in danger. </seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib’s music has also attracted a large following and has gained a reputation for having no hesitation to address topics long considered taboo in his country. </seg>
<seg id="2123">Filled with explicit references to sexuality, freedom, and expression, Hdaib denies that his work is political, but contends that he can’t separate his music from politics. </seg>
<seg id="2124">“I’m Middle Eastern, man. </seg>
<seg id="2125">I was fed politics,” he claims. </seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song titled “Edward Sa’ed,” Hdaib deals with the issue of Palestinian identity head on. </seg>
<seg id="2127">In “Lawla al 3aib,” and in “Ghareeb,” the focus is on poverty. </seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are at their core political goes on. </seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled “Santandano.” </seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one line is repeated with a disproportionate frequency: </seg>
<seg id="2131">“You are free, and everybody is free as well.” </seg>
<seg id="2132">The song proceeds to describe the world as a market from which, in Hdaib’s words, “you can take what you want”—religion or atheism, straightness or gayness. </seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordanian society discusses gay rights, and that well until 2014, comments about equality for LGBTQ+ were highly censored. </seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib gave an interview to Roya, a popular Jordanian network television show, and later found his comments taken out of context, twisted, and in his view, censored. </seg>
<seg id="2135">“They uploaded it with no cutting on Youtube but stream it on air edited,” he claims. </seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly advocates for the Arab LGBTQ+ community and contends that intolerance toward homosexuality is not Islamic. </seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nawas, the eighth century poet who is today remembered for his homoeroticism. </seg>
<seg id="2138">For Hdaib, if Abu Nawas, at one point commissioned by the Caliphs, can openly write about homosexuality in the eight and ninth centuries, why can’t any Jordanian? </seg>
<seg id="2139">The issue, according to Hdaib, isn’t Mashrou Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="2140">Legally sanctioned attacks on free expression and the obstruction of progressive voices in the Hashemite Kingdom have been a re-occurring pattern. </seg>
<seg id="2141">As recently as January 2017, Jordan’s General Intelligence Directorate arrested several former government officials and members of the teacher’s union for social media posts critical of the deep-rooted corruption issues in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2142">For him then, the concert’s cancellation is simply the tip of the iceberg—the deeper issue remains structural changes in the way the next generation of Jordanians think. </seg>
<seg id="2143">For Hdaib, progress is a give and take—Jordan refused to host Mashrou Leila for the second time in a row, but the path towards progress, according to Hdaib, is paved with slow, deliberate, and internal changes—changes, he argues, that are taking place on a daily basis in the heart of Jordanian society. </seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab World free of foreign intervention. </seg>
<seg id="2145">From Baghdad to Jerusalem to Damascus, Hdaib dreams of not only bringing his work, but in his own words, “experiencing the land.” </seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps then, through music, art, and literature—and not bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial impositions of democracy, the region, at least Hdaib hopes, will progress toward real and substantive openness. </seg>
<seg id="2147">In the meantime, Hdaib will keep rapping and by extension, resisting. </seg>

<seg id="2150">Screencap from Discover Nippon Official YouTube Channel. </seg>
<seg id="2151">The Aomori Nebuta Festival is one of Japan's biggest and most popular annual festivals. </seg>
<seg id="2152">As the name suggests, it is held in Aomori, the capital city of the Aomori Prefecture on the northern tip of Honshu &#8212; though it also takes place in the old castle town of Hirosaki, where it's called the Nebuta Festival &#8212; and over three days in August, features dozens of thirty-foot-tall illuminated floats resembling famous historical and mythological Japanese characters. </seg>
<seg id="2153">We're at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori. </seg>
<seg id="2154">We snagged some great seats so we have a great view. </seg>
<seg id="2155">It was super intense! #AomoriNebutaFestival #summerfestivals #thebest! </seg>
<seg id="2156">The early-August event in Aomori City attracts visitors from all over Japan, and from all over the world. </seg>
<seg id="2157">I'm checking out Meguro Gajoen for the first time in a while: two floats are on display. #MeguroGajoen #NebutaFestival </seg>
<seg id="2158">Still, for many people who do make the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the real thing &#8212; and a striking way to spend the summer: </seg>
<seg id="2159">"Don't hold back! </seg>
<seg id="2160">Don't hold back!" #SummerFestival in the north country. </seg>
<seg id="2161">I went and saw the #NebutaFestival. </seg>
<seg id="2162">The site of a sixty-foot-tall Nebuta float was amazing. </seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer! </seg>

<seg id="2166">Physical appearance or grooming have seldom been so relevant. </seg>
<seg id="2167">In this case, they’re helping keep Peruvian youth away from crime and promoting a legitimate profession like barbering. </seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao – the main port in Peru, located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean not far from the Historic Center of Lima, the Peruvian capital – is a region with high crime rates, where street robbery and the sale of illegal drugs have a higher incidence. </seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey released in April 2017 revealed that 51.5% of the area's inhabitants do not feel safe. </seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru − like other Central and South American countries − has experienced an increase in the demand for aesthetic services for men. </seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend of mirroring the physical appearance of sports stars with outlandish hairstyles like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar himself (Brasil) has led ordinary citizens to more frequently seek the expert hands of a barber capable of emulating these elaborate hairdos. </seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for looks that push the envelope in terms of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, “The Battle of Barbers,” which has taken place since 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2173">At this event, experts compete to show who can achieve the most eccentric style, which you can see in the following video (more videos of recent editions of this competition can be found on the public Facebook profile Battle of Barbers): </seg>
<seg id="2174">That’s where educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy school, located in El Callao, found the opportunity to persuade young people to trade weapons for hair styling tools; to receive training instead of bad advice; to work, thanks to the doors that will be opened to them once they learn the art of barbering. </seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this occupation and the opportunities it could bring, dozens of young people have seen they can start working in a profession that is currently very much in vogue. </seg>
<seg id="2176">The school announced technical training workshops before the start of the school year in March, and also reported on some of its achievements: </seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we became the only technical school in the community, as well as the district, a fact we are very proud of, out of the love we have for your children, we’ve built an educational community. </seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombians Send Love Letters to Guerrilla Fighters to Welcome Them Back Into Society &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve. </seg>
<seg id="2180">Used with permission. </seg>
<seg id="2181">The following is an edited version of the piece "Love Letters to Guerrilla Fighters" that was originally published on Tea After Twelve. </seg>
<seg id="2182">It is republished here as part of a partnership with Global Voices. </seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only send love letters to people we know? </seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn’t it much more important to show affection for those who feel rejected? </seg>
<seg id="2185">This idea haunted Colombian youth activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, and served as their inspiration in founding Cartas por la Reconciliación (Letters for Reconciliation), a campaign that encourages young people to send letters to guerrilla fighters. </seg>
<seg id="2186">A historic event had recently taken place in their country, and they wanted to do their part: After years of negotiations, the Colombian government had reached a peace agreement with the FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), thus ending Latin America’s longest-running armed conflict. </seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace accord was considered such an important step that President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. </seg>
<seg id="2188">But there is still a long way to go before true reconciliation and peace have been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters &#8212; people who have lived in illegal camps for years, who have been exposed to the rhetoric of war and have kept their weapons by their sides 24/7 &#8212; will now somehow have to integrate into civilian life. </seg>
<seg id="2190">And Colombian society, accustomed to an abiding fear and, in some cases, a deep hatred for the guerrilla fighters, will have to accept them back and support them in setting up new lives. </seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that Colombia’s youth had to come together and help the reintegration process along. </seg>
<seg id="2192">And they have: So far, thousands of young people have written letters – love letters to ex-guerrilla combatants, welcoming them back into society. </seg>
<seg id="2193">Their aim is to write 6,900 messages, one for each former guerrillero, and hand them over personally. </seg>
<seg id="2194">How Valentine’s Day became the campaign’s inspiration </seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea to found Cartas de Reconciliación was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Bogotá in February 2017, when Leonardo and Cristian had an opportunity to briefly talk with 2014 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Kailash Satyarthi. </seg>
<seg id="2196">The laureate mentioned that we write tons of love letters to those we love on Valentine's Day, while forgetting the people most in need. </seg>
<seg id="2197">His plan this year, he added, was to share love with those who needed encouragement most. </seg>
<seg id="2198">Leonardo and Cristian adapted the idea to the Colombian context, and came up with the plan to send letters of hope and support to the ex-combatants of the FARC now struggling to find their place and establish a new way of life. “The letters will show that Colombian society is ready to change the discourse from a narrative of war to a collective story of peace,” they say. </seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, the campaign has collected more than 2,000 messages, and the first 765 have been delivered. </seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is active in all of Colombia’s biggest cities including Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá. </seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought there was anyone willing to forgive me' </seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on March 19 at one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca area. </seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University of Cali, two members of the Cali mayor’s office and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally hand over the letters. </seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC lined up the way they once did to receive orders from their leaders, but this time it was to receive letters of support from people all over the country. </seg>
<seg id="2205">It was a highly emotional, moving moment for all involved. </seg>
<seg id="2206">"It is incredible how many feelings you can go through in just a few hours, from fear to happiness and everything in between,” political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila stated afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra from the office of the governor of Valle del Cauca recounted the unforgettable experience: </seg>
<seg id="2208">After we delivered the letters, an ex-combatant showed me around in the guerrilla camp. </seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked at one of the 'cambuches' (basically a shack the guerrilla members are living in), I saw a guerrilla member writing something. </seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter because there was an MGL grenade launcher resting on the bed by his side like a lethal sleeping beauty. </seg>
<seg id="2211">I spoke to him anyway, and asked ‘Hello, what are you doing?’ </seg>
<seg id="2212">He replied, 'I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me; it is very beautiful and hopeful. </seg>
<seg id="2213">Nobody has ever written something so beautiful to me in my life, so that is why I am responding.’ Tears began running down my face. </seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him tightly and sat down next to the grenade launcher. </seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps it was tired of war too, of being his faithful companion for years, and wanted to help him write the letter. </seg>
<seg id="2216">He told me more about his life, that he had never expected more from life than war, and that joining the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starving. </seg>
<seg id="2217">'I never thought there was anyone willing to forgive me for my mistakes, but now I know that there is a society waiting for us with open arms. </seg>
<seg id="2218">So far, I have only known how to care for and hold weapons. </seg>
<seg id="2219">But for peace, I can learn to do many things and work with dignity. </seg>
<seg id="2220">Hearing voices previously unheard </seg>
<seg id="2221">To open the event, students and some FARC leaders sat down for a discussion round. </seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up during the war when the FARC was already a clandestine organisation. </seg>
<seg id="2223">So the FARC leaders explained their organisation’s history, their ideals and their point of view regarding the process of peace: “After years and years in which we have seen how the social injustice caused by the state has affected the entire Colombian people, we believe that this opportunity to move towards a political party will allow us to transform the country into a more equitable society. </seg>
<seg id="2224">It is worth overcoming all the obstacles for an objective of this magnitude,” one of them said. </seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed: </seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing the reality of those voices who have never had a voice or a vote, and realizing that those that I often considered monsters, and even came to hate, were also actually human beings with beautiful feelings that were distorted by the environment in which they had to live and by the conditions that created them. </seg>
<seg id="2227">That was deeply painful. </seg>
<seg id="2228">The reality of the country hurts, but it is comforting to realize that all human beings, including those who have killed so many and caused so much damage, have something to teach us, plus a smile and a hug to give away. </seg>
<seg id="2229">Many ex-combatants have replied to the letters. </seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, commander of the encampment in Caldono-Cauca, for instance, wrote the following lines to Cali’s Archbishop Darío de Jesús Monsalve: </seg>
<seg id="2231">Colombians had been led to believe that peace would arrive with disarmament. </seg>
<seg id="2232">This is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="2233">While we have inequality, hunger, and a lack of education, health, and job opportunities, there will always be someone who is ready to take up arms, to revolt and protest to reclaim their rights, and that is completely valid (...) </seg>
<seg id="2234">Nowadays, in the FARC we are betting on peace, on politics without weapons. </seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all the defenders of peace – regardless of race, religion or ideology – to rise above those who dream of a country at war. </seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, contribution, and sacrifice because we know first hand that nothing is easy, that there are many challenges for those of us who defend life as the cornerstone of existence. </seg>
<seg id="2237">We will experience many obstacles, but we will succeed together. </seg>

<seg id="2242">The following is a version of a partner post written by Aida Mirmaksumova that first appeared on the website OC Media. </seg>
<seg id="2243">Queer people in the Caucasus face a number of challenges; discrimination, physical and sexual abuse, and blackmail. </seg>
<seg id="2244">In recent times, activists have observed in horror evidence of the persecution of gay men in Chechnya. </seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat to the LGBTQ community in the country did not emerge overnight. </seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media spoke to a transgender woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences and talked with us about what is happening in the republic. </seg>
<seg id="2247">Queer rights in Chechnya were thrust into the global spotlight several months ago, after reports emerged of the abduction, torture, and murder of queer men in the republic. </seg>
<seg id="2248">The story was broken by Novaya Gazeta journalist Elena Milashina, who revealed how the Chechen authorities were rounding up suspected queer men, and sending them to the secret prisons of Argun. </seg>
<seg id="2249">‘You gave birth to a freak’ </seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina (not her real name) a transgender woman, was born and raised in Grozny. </seg>
<seg id="2251">She has felt that she was a woman since childhood. </seg>
<seg id="2252">Once she reached adulthood, she realised that it wasn’t safe for her in Chechnya and moved to Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens learned of their compatriot's sex change, a hunt began for Sabrina. </seg>
<seg id="2254">In the end, in fear for her life, Sabrina moved to the US. </seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer at a human rights organisation. </seg>
<seg id="2256">Once I was told that that someone needed my help. </seg>
<seg id="2257">It was an acquaintance from Daghestan, a transgender woman. </seg>
<seg id="2258">She had problems; she was in danger. I immediately took her in, because she didn’t have any money. </seg>
<seg id="2259">While I was trying to help her, someone I considered a friend made copies of my documents and posted them all over the internet along with my phone number and photo, sending them to his Chechen affiliates with a following note: ‘So there are no men left in Chechnya that can remove this shame?’ </seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, photos of my documents were widely spread across WhatsApp. </seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015 I was attacked. </seg>
<seg id="2262">I was taking shopping bags from the backseat of my car. I heard a man’s voice: ‘This is a gift to you from your uncle’. </seg>
<seg id="2263">When I looked around I felt something in my body, but there was no pain. </seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard another sentence, but in Chechen: ‘How long are you going to disgrace the family, scum?’ </seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn’t know this person. </seg>
<seg id="2266">I remember that it was a young man, under 30. </seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness. I woke up in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women saw everything and began yelling. </seg>
<seg id="2269">The man ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2270">The women called an ambulance. </seg>
<seg id="2271">I learned at the hospital that I had two stab wounds in my right lung. </seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: Which room were you put in, the men’s room or the women’s room? </seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: I have old documents with my male name, but the doctor understood everything and put me in the women’s room. </seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful to him for this. </seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first saw his name on the door, I was crazily afraid — a Muslim name, Caucasian. </seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a decent man. </seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful for his attitude towards me. </seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats. </seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, relatives wrote to me, strangers, some unknown people. </seg>
<seg id="2281">A nightmare began. </seg>
<seg id="2282">Neighbours and some distant relatives were coming to my family. </seg>
<seg id="2283">They were demanding that I move back to Chechnya to prove that this was all a lie. </seg>
<seg id="2284">There were crazy demands. Some people said that I had to prove it by walking through the streets topless. Some people said that I had to speak on the official Grozny TV and say that I hadn’t changed my sex, that it was all slander and photoshop. </seg>
<seg id="2285">How could I speak on TV with C-cup breasts? </seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: How did your family cope with this pressure? </seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: They still cope with it. </seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people from the street approached my mum once. </seg>
<seg id="2289">They told her: ‘You gave birth to a freak who disgraced not only your family, but the entire republic. </seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you, because you are a pious woman, but you must leave’. </seg>
<seg id="2291">Mum couldn’t take any more and put a noose around her neck. </seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily, neighbours came and saved her. </seg>
<seg id="2293">During that time I had to switch flats several times a day. </seg>
<seg id="2294">I would move into one flat and in a few hours a car would park under the flat's windows with the number 95 numberplate, , and tinted windows. </seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time I understood that something was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2296">My friends, human rights activists, checked the number plates; it turned out that they were looking for me. </seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: How did you leave the country? </seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: Activists helped me. </seg>
<seg id="2299">I don't want to say their names, for safety reasons, but I want to say that I remember everyone, they really helped me. </seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but something unbelievable happened. </seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot understand how it was possible. </seg>
<seg id="2302">Right before my departure from Moscow, I purchased a new sim card in order to call my mother once I arrived. </seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without documents, without anything. </seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my previous sim card and put it in the bin. </seg>
<seg id="2305">I arrived and checked into my hotel. </seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger. </seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the sim card in my phone. </seg>
<seg id="2308">I tried to call my mother through WhatsApp and at the same moment I received a message: ‘Do you think you are safe because you left the country? </seg>
<seg id="2309">We have our people there who have already been notified which hotel you are in, and even about your room number. </seg>
<seg id="2310">To assure you that we know, your room number is 115’. </seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?! </seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number. </seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: Do you keep in touch with your relatives? </seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: Only with my mother and sisters. </seg>
<seg id="2315">However we don’t discuss the sex change — this is a taboo. </seg>
<seg id="2316">Traditional Caucasian moments are still inside me. </seg>
<seg id="2317">No matter how strongly I want to, I cannot ignore this psychological barrier. </seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that while my mum is alive, I will do my best to do everything not to upset her. </seg>
<seg id="2319">If we have a video chat, I do try to look like the person she remembers I was in the past, I mean in the male form. </seg>
<seg id="2320">However it is very hard to do. </seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: Do you know what the situation is like in Chechnya now? </seg>
<seg id="2322">Do you know what friends are doing, those who are left there? </seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I introduced a report in Washington last week. </seg>
<seg id="2324">I needed fresh information about the situation in Chechnya for the report. </seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who spent a month and a half in Argun Prison. </seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that now, during the month of Ramadan, they are not abducting and torturing people, but that everyone looks forward for the end of Ramadan, and he didn’t rule out that there will be a new wave . </seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now bet on people’s relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2328">I mean, they will probably summon their relatives ; they will deal with the person, and then will demand proof that so-called ‘honor’ has been satisfied with blood. </seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: Are there gays left in these secret prisons? </seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: According to an acquaintance of mine, there are not so many now. </seg>
<seg id="2331">Mainly those who do not have rich relatives, or whose relatives have abandoned them to face Kadyrov’s trials. </seg>
<seg id="2332">From what I understand they are being kept there in order to show them off later as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="2333">I mean, if they murder them, they will show their bodies on TV alleging that they attacked some village or military target. </seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand? </seg>
<seg id="2335">As if they were not just people who disappeared but went underground to become militants. </seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: Is this an assumption or do you have a source for this information? </seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I am quoting a person, who spent a month and half at Agrun Prison. </seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that several people who were kept in this prison disappeared after their beards had grown. </seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been no news of them. </seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them. </seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord , this person, personally saw them at the moment they took these people. </seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they have not been presented as bandits, there were no reports of this, but we suspect that such actions are possible. </seg>
<seg id="2343">Otherwise why did they not allow these people to shave? </seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if there were previously such persecutions, abductions of people with a so-called ‘nontraditional’ orientation in the republic? </seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore long hair. </seg>
<seg id="2346">I had a bob cut when I lived in Chechnya. </seg>
<seg id="2347">I think the whole of Grozny knew about me even before 2003 , when I lived in Grozny and I didn’t have any problems. </seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously! </seg>
<seg id="2349">I never had problems even in 1998–1999, when Shariah Law was in force. </seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer then than now. </seg>
<seg id="2351">I mean Russia, which wanted to bring ‘civilisation’ to us, brought us a stone age in the end. </seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: How is this possible with Sharia Law? </seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: My eyebrows were plucked, I had coloured eyelashes, tube-jeans, I wore short tops. </seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Sharia Security never touched me. </seg>
<seg id="2355">There was a spot in front of the Russian theatre in Grozny where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole bunch of people like me gathered. </seg>
<seg id="2356">This was a small square with several benches, and the entire city knew about it, why men would come, young people, to meet up. </seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted. </seg>
<seg id="2358">There is such an expression in Chechen language — Kharda ma Kharda — which means ‘do not laugh at someone else's misfortune’. </seg>
<seg id="2359">They often tell this to children if they make fun of sick people. </seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: So they would just close their eyes to you, as they thought you were sick? </seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2362">They would never insult me, never chase me or beat me. </seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: How long did this grace period last? </seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: Before Kadyrov came in. </seg>
<seg id="2365">In 2005, when he was appointed Prime Minister , he began to speak on television, talking about morality. </seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn’t speak specifically about us, but mainly about the behaviour of women. </seg>
<seg id="2367">However, you could feel in the city that people began to change. </seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who used to smile and laugh, began looking at you questioningly. </seg>
<seg id="2369">I left Chechnya in those years. </seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I went back home I would feel how the situation was worsening in the republic. </seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: What do you do now? </seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I earn money as a waitress. </seg>
<seg id="2373">I am not paid much &#8212; $700–800 a month &#8212; which is not much in the US. </seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I continue being an activist. </seg>
<seg id="2375">Now I am responsible for 15 Muslim women. </seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as kind of a psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise tea drinking meetings, rallies, I go to the hospital with them, I help them to get food cards. </seg>
<seg id="2378">I do all this absolutely free. </seg>
<seg id="2379">I found these people myself. </seg>
<seg id="2380">I was going through shelters. I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help. </seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: Do you wear a hijab? </seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: This is silly. </seg>
<seg id="2383">This is nature — religion has nothing to do with it. </seg>
<seg id="2384">It’s the same thing as Chechens foaming at the mouth to prove that they do not have any gays. </seg>
<seg id="2385">Daghestanis have them, Kabardians have them, and Russians have them too, the entire planet has them, but ‘Chechens — they don’t’. </seg>
<seg id="2386">I came from there, it is unpleasant for me to hear this. </seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here. </seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them — Muslim worshipers, who visit the mosque and fast during Ramadan — live with men. </seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many people mix transgenderism with men who like men, and they think that people change sex so that they have more intimate opportunities, but this is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="2390">This is a different thing, different psychology in fact, different attitudes to things. </seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is important that now I feel in my own shoes and I am not ashamed of my body. </seg>
<seg id="2392">It is not important if you have a partner or not. </seg>
<seg id="2393">I am sorry for the details, but it’s been more than a year since I had intimate relations with anyone. </seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm absolutely not upset about this — I just know that now I am myself. </seg>
<seg id="2395">Local Groups Warn Suicide Is on the Rise Among Iran's Impoverished Arab Ahwazi Community &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="2396">Iran's Ahwaz region is experiencing unusually high unemployment and poverty rates amongst its indigenous Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="2397">The past few months have seen a violent upswing in Arab Ahwazi suicides. </seg>
<seg id="2398">Photo of Arab workers in Iran provided by Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz. </seg>
<seg id="2399">Used with permission. </seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-immolation of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August has thrust the desperate situation of poverty and unemployment for Iran's Ahwazi Arab community into the spotlight. </seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married with a child, living in the Al-Thawra neighborhood of Ahwaz in southwestern Iran. </seg>
<seg id="2402">He had suffered from anxiety, depression and shame due to the helplessness he felt about him and his family's situation, according to Ahwazi rights groups working inside Ahwaz who wished to remain anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="2403">A graphic video shared on YouTube reportedly captured the moments after set himself on fire. </seg>
<seg id="2404">Several people managed to quickly extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was admitted to Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz city. </seg>
<seg id="2405">Local sources stated that his burns were too severe for doctors to treat. </seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterward. </seg>
<seg id="2407">His wasn't the only case of suicide among the Ahwazi Arab minority in August, and local activists are warning of a spike in the number of men taking their own lives. </seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that several others &#8212; Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi, and Shahab Bani Tamim &#8212; hung themselves within the month. </seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories shared one thing in common: They were all family men who felt helpless in their ability to provide for their families because of persecution by the Iranian government or their inability to secure employment to provide for their families. </seg>
<seg id="2410">Ahwazi Arabs suffer poverty, unemployment and discrimination </seg>
<seg id="2411">The region where the Ahwazi Arab community is most present in Iran has been troubled by a deep economic crisis that has hindered its indigenous Arab population from securing its most basic needs. </seg>
<seg id="2412">Until a century ago, Arab Ahwaz was a primarily autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over and made an effort to end ethnic autonomy across Iran in 1925. </seg>
<seg id="2413">The Ahwaz region is responsible for some of Iran's biggest oil and gas fields, and some of the most nourishing and arable lands for Iran's agricultural industry. </seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the region's economy continues to struggle, and the indigenous population see little of the rewards of this wealth. </seg>
<seg id="2415">They are often the victims of untreated illness, hunger and deprivation. </seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies Ahwazi Arabs jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries. </seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also constructed a multitude of dams diverting water from Arab areas to Persian areas such as the Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman, and Qom provinces. </seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only served to worsen the devastation from a drought currently plaguing the region, destroying the local agriculture, fishing, and palm industries. </seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Ahwazi Arab youth has now risen to 81%. </seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, Iran's general director of cooperatives, work, and social welfare, stated that 5% of Ahwazis looking for jobs have pre-high school education, 55% of those seeking work only completed secondary school, and 45% of those Ahwazi job seekers hold university degrees. </seg>
<seg id="2421">A 'systematic policy...that intends to kill the spirit of national resistance' </seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi rights activist based in London, told Global Voices that the situation of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination" has led to a "massive increase" in the number of young Ahwazi men turning to suicide. </seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said unemployment in particular has worsened recently, thanks to a combination of large numbers of ethnic Persians arriving in Ahwaz, and anti-Arab discrimination in hiring practices: </seg>
<seg id="2424">The preference of officials and institutions’ authorities in recruiting non-Arab workforces deprive the local Ahwazi Arabs of access to employment opportunities in all sectors. </seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of the systematic policy of the occupying regime that intends to kill the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, forcing them to search for subsistence outside their homeland of Ahwaz. </seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who have had to change their first and last name so as to hide their Ahwazi Arab identity to get hired as even Arabic names cannot be tolerated in the workplace let alone speaking Arabic or wearing Arabic clothes. </seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the conditions that Ahwazi Arabs are forced to bear, human rights defenders are sounding the alarm before things become explosive. </seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen if the world sits up and takes notice. </seg>
<seg id="2429">The number one cause for suicide is untreated depression. </seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is preventable. </seg>

<seg id="2433">Why I Don’t Identify With Feminism, Even When It's Intersectional &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo published on Pixabay and used here under a CC0 Creative Commons license. </seg>
<seg id="2435">This is an edited version of an essay by Ayomide Zuri, originally published on Afroféminas. </seg>
<seg id="2436">It inspired serious debate in the comments section of the original post. </seg>
<seg id="2437">Many women—especially white women who claim to be intersectional feminists—get frustrated when I say I’m not a feminist. </seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I don't participate in the movement. </seg>
<seg id="2439">They have even tried to persuade me using academic and social reasoning that supposedly underpins why I should be a feminist. </seg>
<seg id="2440">They cite, for example, the fact that women still earn less than men of the same educational level. </seg>
<seg id="2441">That women continue to be subjected to scrutiny with regard to what they do with their bodies. </seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic. </seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social barriers prevent women from attaining success in various domains, and gender discrimination is norm in several countries and religious communities. </seg>
<seg id="2444">I’m well aware of all this. </seg>
<seg id="2445">I know about it, I know it’s true and I’ve experienced it many times over. </seg>
<seg id="2446">I’m a black woman. </seg>
<seg id="2447">However, when I mention race, racism, black cis women, black trans women, black LGBTiQ women, or black disapora women and the way we’ve always been segregated and discriminated against—when I mention the way we have been physical, emotionally and verbally abused both inside and outside of the feminist movement, many white and intersectional white feminists remain silent. </seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet, they agree that women, all women, should join together to “lift their voices and sing” “Kumbuyah, my Lord” for (some) women’s rights. </seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don’t want to talk about the racialized violence of the state as something separate from gender violence, and from which black women doubly. </seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about how black women and other women of color earn less than white men and women. </seg>
<seg id="2451">Or how black and immigrant girls are more frequently suspended from school, as a result of what is clearly a problem with integration. </seg>
<seg id="2452">Or how women from black or immigrant communities are more likely to experience domestic violence than white women. </seg>
<seg id="2453">While I wish for equality for all women, all men, and all races, I—as a black woman—cannot align myself with a movement that is focused on white women and which refuses to include racial and gender inequality. </seg>
<seg id="2454">I’m fed up and I won’t fight to be included in a space oriented toward white feminists in which I and many other black women have been rejected time and time again. </seg>
<seg id="2455">Just like Sojourner Truth declared in her 1851 speech, “Ain't I a Woman?”, I refuse to be a part of a movement that dehumanizes and alienates black women. </seg>
<seg id="2456">Groups that successfully appropriate our style and traditions in order to advance their own self-centered programs. </seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to teach white feminists the importance of the crossing of race and gender, because some will continue to ignore the relevance of black women in the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to educate them. </seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was created to distinguish itself from white feminism and include women of other ethnicities, it still has the word "feminism" in its name. </seg>
<seg id="2459">I’d rather dissociate myself from feminism altogether, so as to live in peace in a Womanist space that was created with my dark skin and my status as a woman in mind, than defend a white, feminist paradigm that is so pervasive that intersectionality is venerated as a latter-day invention. </seg>
<seg id="2460">Now, more than ever, it is time for us black women to define ourselves on our own terms, and to gather in spaces created by us and for us. </seg>
<seg id="2461">As Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of “Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves” talked about defending ourselves by defining ourselves in our own terms, black women can find safety only in spaces where our cultural, mental, emotional, physical and even spiritual qualities are honored. </seg>
<seg id="2462">Some white/intersectional feminists will cry separatism and segregation after reading this, but please use this opportunity to educate yourself about hypocrisy and contradictions of the feminist movement regarding black women. </seg>
<seg id="2463">Within a Womanist movement, I can elevate black women and women from other cultures because within this paradigm I am recognized. </seg>
<seg id="2464">I’m acknowledged as part of this movement because of my dark skin and because I am a woman. </seg>
<seg id="2465">And in a space where my vitality is neither disrespected, ignored nor discarded, I, as a black woman, can thrive. </seg>

<seg id="2469">For the past seven years, Nabil Musa has been traveling — often times on a paddle board or in a raft — around the Kurdistan region of Iraq on a one-man mission to promote the importance of clean waterways for the current and future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa as he explains his relationship to the rivers in his region and the effect pollution has in his community. </seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something about the river we lost when I was a child," Musa said. </seg>
<seg id="2472">Experts throughout the country fear that decades of war, pollution, uncharted development and damming mean a water crisis in Iraq is imminent. </seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is part of the NGO Waterkeepers Iraq &#8212; an affiliate of Waterkeeper Alliance &#8212; which advocates and works “to protect the rivers, streams and waterways of Iraq and support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources.” </seg>
<seg id="2474">Toward the end of the video, Musa sums up the urgency at the heart of his work by asking, “If we don’t have this water, how can we survive?” <!-- Code Embed v2.2.1 --> <!-- End of Code Embed code --> </seg>

<seg id="2480">The following text is an abridged, edited republication of Kurtural's "The Epidemic of Violence Against Women in Paraguay," an article that forms part of the series #PorSerMujer (#ForBeingWoman), which describes and denounces the crisis of violence against women in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2481">The majority of the names were changed to protect individuals' privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing to Luis Balbuena, her former partner who was violent toward her while they were dating. </seg>
<seg id="2483">Time had passed since their relationship ended, and the police said her testimony would go on the record, but that was about it. </seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman came forward accusing Balbuena of abuse, the record of Báez's complaint didn't make any difference. </seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her complaint altogether. </seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the cycle of violence against women is difficult. </seg>
<seg id="2487">Generally speaking, when women actually do file a complaint, they do not receive support from the state. </seg>
<seg id="2488">In many instances, women are also financially dependent on the men abusing them, which helps explain why only 20 percent of women who say they endure violence actually come forward to law enforcement. </seg>
<seg id="2489">Sexist punches and the epidemic's statistics It's not easy to determine exactly how many women are being abused, says Myrian González, a researcher specialized in gender issues at the Center of Documentation and Studies, a social sciences research institute. </seg>
<seg id="2490">"There are various data and records that don't allow for even an approximation of the extent of the gender violence against women in Paraguay," she states. </seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures that are available, however, are startling. </seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 70 percent of the 9,600 domestic-violence reports that came before the District Attorney dealt with violence against women. </seg>
<seg id="2493">Of reports filed with the police, 86 percent were brought by women. </seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 domestic-violence reports filed with the Peace Court — again, 86 percent were made by women. </seg>
<seg id="2495">In those reports, 40 percent of women said they'd suffered physical abuse, and 55 percent of women said they'd been subjected to psychological abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, fail to capture fully the scale of violence against women in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the country's minister for women, Ana Baiardi, these crimes go widely under-reported. "For each woman who reports psychological abuse in Paraguay, there are nine who do not. </seg>
<seg id="2498">For each woman who reports physical abuse, there are two who do not," she said in late 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2499">The lack of a penal category specifying femicide impedes law enforcement from recording properly how many Paraguayans are murdered annually by their current or former romantic partners. </seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August, journalists recorded at least 12 different femicides in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 women murdered by partners, past and present. </seg>
<seg id="2502">She estimates sexist violence claims the life of one woman in Paraguay every ten days. </seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez could become Carlos Vera's girlfriend, he insisted that she tell him everyone she'd ever dated previously. </seg>
<seg id="2506">She wasn't too keen on the idea, but she eventually gave in, and lived to regret it. </seg>
<seg id="2507">Twenty-eight years old today, Mariana isn't dating Carlos anymore, but for two years she endured his psychological abuse — one of the most common types of violence against women, and one of the hardest to detect: </seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I could be a victim of abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2509">When I would read about it, I would think that this happens to some women because of their submissiveness — because they let themselves be fooled by violent men. </seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me. </seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report Carlos Vera's abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2512">Without giving names or surnames, she wrote on Facebook, describing his insults, the isolation he subjected her to, and his various attacks throughout their two-year relationship. </seg>
<seg id="2513">Plenty of people responded to her Facebook posts, including Carlos himself, who asked her rhetorically if he'd ever raised his hand against her, refusing to accept that his treatment of her amounted to abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2514">Others on Facebook asked Mariana why she put up with Carlos and didn't leave him sooner. </seg>
<seg id="2515">Victims of abuse must bear at least some responsibility for their abuse, these people seemed to imply. </seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, a foreigner in Paraguay, spent some eight years battling the Paraguayan authorities to prove that her ex-partner abused her. </seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te creo ("I Believe You") network, which is made up of women who have suffered different kinds of abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they share their experiences, and listen to and support one another. </seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what others will not: they take each others' testimonies seriously. </seg>
<seg id="2520">For Victoria, it all began with psychological abuse. </seg>
<seg id="2521">Her partner — a man of means — eventually convinced her that she was worthless. </seg>
<seg id="2522">Afterwards, he started beating her. </seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's complaints to the authorities went unanswered, and she received no support from her relatives, who were living abroad. </seg>
<seg id="2524">She carried on with a judicial process against her ex-partner — a labyrinthine legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which the main obstacle was money, power, and the influence of her aggressor. </seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguayan laws: Good composition, poor execution </seg>
<seg id="2526">"Paraguay has many laws that are very good, but they are not executed. </seg>
<seg id="2527">To report abuse is a journey of resistance and fighting against corruption in the judicial sphere," Victoria Santos says Victoria. </seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a program official for UN Women in Paraguay, agrees that the difficulty of applying the laws in Paraguay is immense. </seg>
<seg id="2529">This August 10, Paraguayan legislators discussed the so-called #PorEllas (#ForThem) law. </seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag, along with #NiUnaMenos (#NotOneLess), is part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International. </seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill proposes making femicide a new kind of criminal offense with stricter penalties — a concept that's already been adopted by regional neighbors like Argentina and Bolivia. </seg>
<seg id="2532">The bill was passed by the legislators, but with amendments to win over those who feared the new law would open the door to the decriminalization of abortion, currently illegal in Paraguay in all cases and punishable by up to five years in prison. </seg>
<seg id="2533">The law's original draft made the state responsible for many of the procedural costs (economic and bureaucratic) victims of violence currently have to pay, just in order to file a police report and reach safe haven. </seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri says this legislation will be ineffective if lawmakers can not fund it properly: </seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen more as an element of interpersonal relationships. </seg>
<seg id="2536">We need a change in mentality in order to denaturalize the violence. </seg>
<seg id="2537">To keep silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in the impunity of the aggressors. </seg>
<seg id="2538">We must continue reporting until we succeed in getting abuse to no longer be seen as normal. </seg>
<seg id="2539">On November 10, Paraguay's Senate approved the legislation — again with amendments, including the removal of a proposal calling for reconciliation between a couple in cases of domestic violence. </seg>
<seg id="2540">There are mixed opinions about the amendments. </seg>
<seg id="2541">The reconciliation clause was seen as an opportunity for the abuser to attack his victim, so women's rights advocates welcomed the prohibition. </seg>
<seg id="2542">Nevertheless, the elimination of the word "gender" from the text and the removal of “political violence” and “sexual harassment” from the specifics of the law is seen as a major setback. </seg>
<seg id="2543">This text is an abridged, edited republication of Kurtural's "The Epidemic of Violence Against Women in Paraguay," an article that forms part of the series #PorSerMujer (#ForBeingWoman), which describes and denounces the crisis of violence against women in Paraguay. </seg>

<seg id="2545">A Year After Newspaper Ban, Independent Media Remain Under Siege in Oman &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="2546">"The website has been suspended by decision of the information minister", a note on the homepage of the banned Azamn newspaper says. </seg>
<seg id="2547">It has now been more than a year since Omani authorities closed the independent Arabic-language newspaper Azamn over its coverage of corruption in the Sultanate. </seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the paper's editors, remains in prison, serving a one-year jail sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other Azamn editors, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri were also detained and put on trial, but later released. </seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled since 1970 by Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who came to power after overthrowing his father, Said Ben Timor. </seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, he has held the most important positions in the country besides being its sole Sultan: Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council of Planning, and President of the Central Bank. </seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan’s years of ruling have been characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, especially the Internal Security Service (ISS), to confiscate public freedoms, including freedom of the press, and to torture and intimidate human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, and imprison them. </seg>
<seg id="2553">Authorities are systematically curtailing peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and preventing citizens including activists from expressing their views freely – whether online or offline– about the public affairs of their country such as corruption in government agencies and institutions. </seg>
<seg id="2554">The targeting and closure of Azamn newspaper and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a severe blow to press freedom in the country. </seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper that reported on corruption in Oman (which is an absolute monarchy) since its establishment in 2007, until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016. </seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces arrested Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Azamn's editor-in-chief, after the paper published an article on 26 July 2016 entitled "supreme parties tie the hands of justice", which addressed corruption in the judiciary, and the interference of senior officials in judicial decisions. </seg>
<seg id="2557">The report accused government officials of pressuring judges in the country's Supreme Court to overturn a verdict in an inheritance case </seg>
<seg id="2558">The July 26, 2016 edition of Azamn newspaper which featured on its front-page a report with the headline: “supreme parties tie the hands of justice”. </seg>
<seg id="2559">Photo source: the Facebook page of Azamn </seg>
<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, the ISS summoned Zaher Al-Abri, member of the editorial committee, to appear before the Special Division, and detained him upon arrival. </seg>
<seg id="2561">On 09 August 2016, the ISS arrested deputy editor Yousef Al-Haj, who was acting as the newspaper's editor-in-chief after Al-Maamari’s arrest. </seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister for Information gave the order that "the publication and circulation of the newspaper by all means, including online, is not allowed starting on 9 August 2016." </seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the Court of First Instance in Muscat held its final hearing in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj, and Al-Abri, and issued prison sentences against them. </seg>
<seg id="2564">The court also ordered the newspaper to close permanently. </seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of “disturbing public order", "misuse of the Internet", "publishing details of a civil case", and "undermining the prestige of the state.” </seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was further found guilty of violating a publication ban and slander. </seg>
<seg id="2567">They were both sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, a fine of 3000 Omani Riyals (US $7,800) each and banned from working as journalists for one year. </seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one-year imprisonment and fined a thousand Riyals (US $2600) after being found guilty of using “an information network for the dissemination of material that might be prejudicial to public order.” </seg>
<seg id="2569">His bail was set at 5000 OR (US $13000), and he had already been released on 22 August 2016 prior to sentencing. </seg>
<seg id="2570">At a hearing held on 26 December 2016, the Court of Appeal acquitted Al-Abri while sentencing Al-Haj to one year in prison and Al-Maamari to six months in prison, to include the time they spent in detention. </seg>
<seg id="2571">On 10 April 2017, Al-Maamari was released from the Central Prison in Muscat, after serving his six-month sentence, leaving Al-Haj in prison serving his one-year sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2572">The court of appeal also revoked the decision to shut down “Azamn” newspaper which was issued by the Ministry of Information. </seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the court's decision to lift the ban on Azamn, the Omani government has continued to target the newspaper. </seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January 2017, the Minister of Information issued a directive that extended the closure of “Azamn” for three months. </seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minster of Information personally signed another directive which extended the closure of “Azamn” for an additional three months – once again challenging the Court of Appeal's decision to re-allow the newspaper to publish. </seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the targeting of its journalists is not the only case of press freedom violation that has recently taken place in Oman. </seg>
<seg id="2577">Other violations include the blocking of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and exercising pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper, to put an end to its operations. </seg>
<seg id="2578">By continuing to close Azamn and imprison its journalist Al-Haj, it seems that Omani authorities are still unwilling to put an end to the broader crackdown on press freedom. </seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) urges the authorities in Oman to: </seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Immediately and unconditionally release Yousef Al-Haj; </seg>
<seg id="2581">2. Provide a secure environment for Azamn newspaper to carry out its journalistic work; </seg>
<seg id="2582">3. Protect freedom of the press in the country; and </seg>
<seg id="2583">4. Ensure in all circumstances the ability of human rights defenders and journalists in Oman to carry out their legitimate human rights work without fear of retaliation and without any restrictions, including judicial harassment. </seg>
<seg id="2584">The Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR) is an independent, non-profit and non-governmental organisation that works to provide support and protection to human rights defenders (including independent journalists, bloggers, lawyers, etc.) in the Gulf region and its neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. </seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier in 2016 in Zambia with his permission </seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research conducted in Africa is often undercovered and ignored by the media, but it is a thriving field that highlights the continent's most pressing needs. </seg>
<seg id="2589">The reason why there is demand for locally conducted medical research is two-fold: Firstly, global health currently does not have the range of medicines and vaccines required to tackle the health issues specific to the African continent. </seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria have a greater detrimental impact on the poorest countries of Africa and a lack of investment in products targeting these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem. </seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research conducted by African scientists will serve to develop research capacities in Africa and an increased role for science and technology can only be beneficial to the continent's economic development. </seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is the director of the Central Laboratory at Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ). </seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990's just as the AIDS epidemic began to take a major toll on the national health. </seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia to pursue higher education in the United States in Louisiana, then Indiana. </seg>
<seg id="2595">He conducted his own research on the HIV virus as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania before deciding to go back home in order to make an impact on Zambian healthcare. </seg>
<seg id="2596">Global Voices discussed both the future of medical research in Zambia and the things that the media gets wrong about such research in Africa with Dr. Warrier. </seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier is speaking in a personal capacity): </seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): What is your research topic? </seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: I'm doing a lot of implementation work currently, supporting the Zambian national ART programme with Laboratory testing. </seg>
<seg id="2600">I am just starting a research programme in Molecular Diagnostics development for HIV, TB, and other pathogens of interest. </seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: What do you see/think are the trending and hot topics in science in your country and Africa in general? </seg>
<seg id="2602">How is it different from that in Western countries? </seg>

<seg id="2615">Supplies are expensive and take months to be imported from other countries. </seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: What are the public’s opinions towards science and scientists in Africa? </seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: There is interest, but an extremely limited understanding of the scientific method. </seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest critical thinking and the scientific method be taught in school to improve the situation. </seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: In your opinion, what is the potential in scientific research in Africa, where it should focus on and how we can help its development? </seg>
<seg id="2620">There is amazing potential. </seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen incredible students of all ages. </seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for dedicated science education starting at all ages. </seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, outer space exploration, healthcare (non-communicable and Infectious diseases), and traditional medicine efficacy will pay off big. </seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: Could you describe the pros and cons of the life as a scientist in Africa vs Western countries based on your experience? </seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: Mainly it is the speed of doing things and the access to expertise that are big challenges here. </seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals have to put articles behind paywalls is also limiting the amount of information and the speed with which research can be done. </seg>

This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that highlights international environmental solutions in action, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement. </seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the U.S. since the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, among them Outredgeous, which last year became the first plant that NASA astronauts grew and ate in space. </seg>
<seg id="2631">For nearly 20 years, Morton’s work was limited only by his imagination and by how many different kinds of lettuce he could get his hands on. </seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the early 2000s, he started noticing more and more lettuces were patented, meaning he would not be able to use them for breeding. </seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents weren’t just for different types of lettuce, but specific traits such as resistance to a disease, a particular shade of red or green, or curliness of the leaf. </seg>
<seg id="2634">Such patents have increased in the years since, and are encroaching on a growing range of crops, from corn to carrots — a trend that has plant breeders, environmentalists and food security experts concerned about the future of the food production. </seg>
<seg id="2635">A determined fellow dedicated to the millennia-old tradition of plant breeding, Morton still breeds lettuce — it just takes longer, because more restrictions make it harder for him to do his work. </seg>
<seg id="2636">“It’s just a rock in the river and I’m floating around it. </seg>
<seg id="2637">That’s basically what we have to do, but it breaks the breeding tradition,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2638">“I think these lettuce patents are overreaching and if they , nobody can breed a new lettuce anymore because all the traits have been claimed.” </seg>
<seg id="2639">He continues to work with what is available, breeding for traits he desires while being extra careful to avoid any material restricted by intellectual property rights. </seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing in the U.S. and around the world: “open source” breeding. </seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts on the International Space Station grew and ate Outredgeous red romaine lettuce in the station’s “Veggie” system, a test kitchen for growing plants in space. </seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo by NASA </seg>
<seg id="2643">If the term sounds like it belongs in the tech world more than in plant breeding, that’s no accident. </seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative, inspired by “the free and open source software movement that has provided alternatives to proprietary software,” was created to ensure that some plant varieties and genes will remain free from intellectual property rights and available for plant breeders in perpetuity. </seg>
<seg id="2645">As part of the initiative, commonly known as OSSI, U.S. breeders can take a pledge that commits the seeds they produce to remain available for others to use for breeding in the future. </seg>
<seg id="2646">That doesn’t mean they can’t build a business with or sell them. </seg>
<seg id="2647">What the pledge does is allow farmers who buy seeds from an open-source breeder to cross them with other material to breed their own varieties and save them for future seasons — two things many crop patents forbid. </seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have committed to OSSI since the initiative’s launch in 2014. </seg>
<seg id="2649">Compromised Future </seg>
<seg id="2650">For University of Wisconsin–Madison professor emeritus and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the ability to breed new crops are matters of both food security and environmental protection. </seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in larger issues like biodiversity, farmers’ rights, control of the food system and use of agricultural chemicals, which many independent breeders try to avoid or reduce by breeding natural resistance into crops themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the open-source movement is not about genetically modified organisms; patents can affect all crops, vegetable or grain, GMO or conventional, organic or not. </seg>
<seg id="2653">“Control over the seed is what’s at the core of all environmental sustainability that we’re working toward,” he says, pointing to the increased consolidation in the global agriculture industry, most recently with the mergers announced between ChemChina and Syngenta in August 2016, and Monsanto and Bayer in September. “If you go to the farmer’s market and you’re interested in buying good, local, sustainably produced vegetables, you also need to understand that most vegetables are coming out of a breeding process that is itself endangered. </seg>
<seg id="2654">We will not have food sovereignty until we have seed sovereignty.” </seg>
<seg id="2655">The Open Source Seed Initiative, where U.S. breeders take a pledge committing their seeds to remain available for others to use for breeding in the future, is in contrast to the practice of patenting seeds and crop traits. </seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg </seg>
<seg id="2657">OSSI supporters argue that as planting material becomes more restricted through intellectual property rights, the future of the food supply is compromised because the gene pool is continually shrinking. </seg>
<seg id="2658">OSSI executive director Claire Luby, whose Ph.D. thesis focused on genetic variation and availability within carrots, found that about one-third of all carrot material has been protected by intellectual property rights, rendering it unavailable or difficult for plant breeders to use. </seg>
<seg id="2659">Similar estimates do not yet exist for other crops, but experts such as Luby are confident that big commodity crops such as corn are even more heavily impacted than crops such as lettuce and carrots. </seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Perspective </seg>
<seg id="2661">Growers breed plants to selectively express desirable traits — from those that will improve a crop’s taste or color, to those that help crops thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or disease. </seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of crop-trait patents say the increase in patents is shrinking the catalog of plant material available to breeders at a time when the need for genetic diversity is greater than ever, thanks to the less-predictable conditions brought on by climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognized the importance of genetic diversity, saying it’s crucial for the company’s operations and Monsanto works to preserve diversity through its four gene banks and by collaborating with institutions around the world, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="2664">But she disagreed with the notion that intellectual property suppresses other breeding efforts. “Patents and inspire innovation,” she wrote. </seg>
<seg id="2665">“Basically, the patent creates a map to allow anyone else to do the same once the patent expires. </seg>
<seg id="2666">Oftentimes those ‘how to’ instructions enable others to accomplish the same result by finding another method to get there. </seg>
<seg id="2667">So rather than hindering innovation, such protection facilitates it by placing more material and know-how in the public domain.” </seg>
<seg id="2668">Morton, however, argues waiting the 20 years for a patent to expire is no way to encourage innovation, and waiting that long to breed crops that can adapt to changing conditions is a losing battle. </seg>
<seg id="2669">Even that misses the main point for Morton, though: genetic resources have always belonged to the commons, and should continue to be a public good, he says. “ have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not what move us. </seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to improve farming for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="2671">That’s a different motivator, not promoted by stifling the free use of the best and newest genetic resources.” </seg>
<seg id="2672">Furthermore, Morton takes issue with the very concept of patenting a plant trait. “You didn’t actually create it,” he says. </seg>
<seg id="2673">“The plant created it, and the plant breeder has no idea how the plant created that trait. </seg>
<seg id="2674">It is just nature at work.” </seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, a plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and OSSI board member, there’s another component to breeding that’s important. “When you breed a variety, you breed your own values right into the variety,” she says. </seg>
<seg id="2676">“If you believe in huge agribusiness farms with monocultures that are managed with massive doses of herbicides, then you breed your concept of what agriculture should be like into that variety. </seg>
<seg id="2677">I do exactly the opposite.” </seg>
<seg id="2678">While a handful of medium-sized companies (those with international markets but smaller than, say, Monsanto) hold patents, most smaller seed companies are able to survive without patenting — they either are opposed to the practice, have decided the process is too costly to be worthwhile, or both. </seg>
<seg id="2679">Independent plant breeder Frank Morton selects lettuce seed in his breeding nursery. </seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton </seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton argues that avoiding intellectual property protection also encourages more active breeding. “Seems to me that my incentive to crank out new stuff is stronger than . </seg>
<seg id="2682">I need new stuff constantly to feed my catalog with new material, knowing that my competitors will be selling my varieties within a few years,” he says. “A patent creates a 20-year insulation against competitive intrusion, which seems pretty cushy from my perspective.” Global Response </seg>
<seg id="2683">While the U.S. seems to be leading the open-source charge, the concept is rapidly spreading around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional resource organization, runs an open-source seed program, working with farmers to preserve seeds for traditional food varieties and to involve them in breeding new varieties that meet specific needs. </seg>
<seg id="2685">The organization also helps farmers access and market open-source seeds. </seg>
<seg id="2686">German organization Agrecol is in the process of launching an open source “license,” essentially a more formal, legally binding version of the OSSI pledge for breeders in the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="2687">(Regulations governing breeding differ from country to country, so the OSSI pledge cannot simply be adopted as-is in Europe or elsewhere.) </seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, declared that conventionally bred plants should be nonpatentable, marking a shift from the European Patent Office’s current stance, which permits patents for conventionally bred crops. </seg>
<seg id="2689">The statement is not law, however; it will now be up to European governments to push the patent office to implement the commission’s statement. </seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on open-source seed systems in Ethiopia, attracting farmers, community seed bank operators, and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from around East Africa to learn about the open-source seed movement and the global shift toward patenting seeds. </seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, who runs Hivos’ open-source seed systems program, says the organization is in the process of building a global alliance on open-source seed systems that it hopes to launch formally next year. </seg>
<seg id="2692">A coalition of environmental and development groups (including Hivos, international development nonprofit USC Canada and the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project. </seg>
<seg id="2693">And in a report published in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food — a collaboration of philanthropic foundations, including the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and more — said that to ensure a resilient food supply, farmers need to be able to access, exchange and improve seeds, and have a voice in shaping seed policies. </seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasized the role that diverse, local seed supplies play in sustainable food systems — a connection that Luby of OSSI hopes more people start to make soon. </seg>
<seg id="2695">“The food movement has focused on where is it grown and how is it grown, and the seed systems haven’t been as much a part of those conversations,” she says. “We’re trying to connect with people to say, ‘Hey, there’s an even deeper layer to your food.’” </seg>

<seg id="2721">Photo by Flickr user Turinboy (CC BY 2.0) </seg>
<seg id="2722">The Egyptian authorities have continued to block websites, this time targeting the site of a human rights group as well as a columnist's blog. </seg>
<seg id="2723">Over the weekend of August 5, the government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents and reports on human rights violations in Egypt and across the Arab region. </seg>
<seg id="2724">In August 6 statement published on Facebook, the rights group slammed Egyptian authorities for the measure, while pledging to continue its work in support of human rights in the region: </seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information - in spite of this attack, which is a mockery of the Egyptian law and constitution by the authorities, who are supposed to respect and uphold the law - remains committed to its mission to defending freedom of expression, human rights in the Arab world, exposing the violations in this part of the world, and speaking up for the victims, which is a role that now comes at a very high price more than ever, yet it also became more important than ever before. ANHRI confirms that it will seek all technical means to overcome the blocking and will not give in to it, and insists that it will continue to do its role. </seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is the first website belonging to a human rights group in Egypt to be censored, since authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, including the independent news site Mada Masr, the Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post, and the website of the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network, for allegedly "supporting terrorism". </seg>
<seg id="2727">#Egypt : 1st human rights org to get swept up in wave of website blocking - @anhri - major source of human rights info in Arabic https://t.co/NIZmOpDS5K — ARTICLE19 MiddleEast (@article19mena) August 7, 2017 </seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no longer accessible in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada has been using his blog to disseminate the columns and articles he writes for websites and media blocked in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to bypass the censorship machinery of the Egyptian government has itself been targeted. </seg>
<seg id="2731">The blog-publishing service Blogger, which hosts Ziada's blog, remains accessible. </seg>
<seg id="2732">A former photojournalist, Ziada spent nearly 500 days in prison after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security forces while covering a student protest and taking footage of police beating two students. </seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly address politics and the human rights situation in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="2734">On Facebook, he reflected on the government's blocking of his blog and what it means to him: </seg>
<seg id="2735">The of blocking blogs is very old, but it is a precedence in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi, and apart from the fact that the blocking of the blog may not be of importance to the world, it does matter to me for two reasons: </seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They have made me feel that I am indeed under siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, national security summons, blocking blog in addition to every single website I worked for. </seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proved that I was not writing for nothing, in other words, my words have an impact even if it is for a small audience. </seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that the blog was an archive for me. </seg>
<seg id="2739">I started using it to post articles to bypass censorship. </seg>
<seg id="2740">But, now that they have blocked it, and that they fear words, I can still change the link or create a second blog. </seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave continue till the end. </seg>
<seg id="2742">From May 24 to August 6, Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites, according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), which conducted technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISPs) including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat. </seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of services aimed at bypassing internet censorship and browsing the internet privately, known as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). </seg>
<seg id="2744">The association reported in its research: </seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday the 12th of June, we noticed the beginning of blocking websites that provide VPN services. </seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intent of the Government to continue blocking and filtering the content that Egyptian users could access. </seg>
<seg id="2747">What makes the situation worse, is that these blocking decisions are taken behind closed doors and without a due process that gives Egyptians the possibility to challenge them in court. </seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question is how far is the Egyptian government willing to take its internet censorship campaign and who is it going to target next. </seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro at War? </seg>
<seg id="2750">Its Residents Debate &middot; Global Voices </seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian Army in an operation in favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the state crisis. </seg>
<seg id="2752">Image by: Estado Maior (CML) via Fotos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0 </seg>
<seg id="2753">Everyday, newspapers all around Brazil are flooded with grim headlines about Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's second largest city and home to many of the images found on the country's postcards. </seg>
<seg id="2754">Some examples of these headlines read: </seg>
<seg id="2755">‘14-year-old Girl Shot Dead Inside School’, ‘Every Two Days a Police Officer is Killed in Rio de Janeiro', ‘Robbers Used Military Rifles to Mug a Pharmacy’, 'President Temer sends 8,500 Army, Navy and Air Force men to Rio'. </seg>
<seg id="2756">In 2017, with an economic crisis and public funds under strain, violence in Rio de Janeiro reached its highest levels in a decade. </seg>
<seg id="2757">One NGO has even called on the UN to intervene. </seg>
<seg id="2758">These stories are becoming commonplace and it's unacceptable &#8212; or at least that's what the management of one local newspaper says. </seg>
<seg id="2759">In an editorial dated August 16th, titled ‘This Is Not Normal’, newspaper Extra &#8212; famous for its detailed coverage of violence in Rio &#8212; stated that it will be creating a new section named "Rio's War". </seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence from the city will now be published in that section. </seg>
<seg id="2761">They explained the motives behind their decision: </seg>
<seg id="2762">EXTRA will continue to report the kind of crimes that take place in any big city in the world: homicides, robberies, sexual crimes… However, everything that deviates from the standard of civilised normality, and that we only see in Rio, will be on the war section pages. (…) this is our way of shouting: this is not normal! </seg>
<seg id="2763">It is the alternative we have to avoid making our journalistic eye complacent in the face of barbarism. </seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Extra’s editor-in-chief, Octávio Guedes, says the decision is not something to be proud of, but rather it's a sign of failure: </seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra must be the only newspaper on the planet that has a war section in a country that does not recognise the war. </seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, one of the paper's reporters says that according to the Public Safety Institute of Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas in the city that are under the control of criminal organizations. </seg>
<seg id="2767">The editorial also says: </seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when distorted, can be used to cover up truculent acts by a police force that shoots first, asks later. </seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on intelligence, on fighting police corruption, and that has as its target not the civil population, but the economic power of mobs and all its associates. </seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the word "war" do more harm than good? </seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article published by The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira counter-argues that by labelling the violence in Rio a "war", the media might end up justifying a failed public security policy and even hindering police accountability. </seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war. </seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption, poor planning &#8212; as Extra itself has shown by analyzing Army operations in Rio &#8212; added to a lack of investment in human resources and intelligence and the historical and complacent neglect of public services. </seg>
<seg id="2774">Just a reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital. </seg>
<seg id="2775">March for peace in Niterói, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in homage of assassinated cultural promoter Rafael Lage. </seg>
<seg id="2776">Image by: Fernando Frazão/Agência Brasil, published with permission. </seg>
<seg id="2777">For Cecília, to say that Rio de Janeiro is "the most violent place in Brazil" is innacurate: "22 out of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are located in the North and Northeast regions, according to data from 2015 (the latest available). </seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these are found in the state of Rio de Janeiro. </seg>
<seg id="2779">When we look at homicide rates , Rio ranks 16th", she writes. </seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra is owned by Globo corporation, Latin America's largest media conglomerate, which, Cecília points out, has for decades been echoing the state's public security policies. </seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these security policies was the creation of the UPP (Pacifying Police Unit), launched in Rio in 2003, whose goal is to deploy massive police force to 'conquer' a favela and establish a permanent unit there. </seg>
<seg id="2782">While initially reducing violent deaths, the UPP came under fire in recent years after numerous reports of harassment and repression were filed by the poor communities these newly established police units were meant to protect. </seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted an article he wrote in 2010 in which he discusses why the violence in Rio does not meet the necessary criteria &#8212; as defined by the Geneva Conventions &#8212; to be labeled a 'civil war'. </seg>
<seg id="2784">He says: </seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides the legal debate, there is a serious human consequence in saying there is a war in Rio. </seg>
<seg id="2786">By doing this, society stimulates the State to act with means and methods that are typical of a war, entering in a 'enemy’s' territory, where a civil person is only a blur in the landscape, subject to ‘collateral damage’ and ‘lost bullets'. </seg>
<seg id="2787">War or not, residents of Rio's favelas continue to suffer. </seg>
<seg id="2788">It’s been a week since the police climbed up the hill of Jacarezinho to avenge the death of an officer. </seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all the violence, another incident made the headlines: a fruit seller was killed after being shot by police from a helicopter. </seg>

<seg id="2800">Screenshot from the promotional video. </seg>
<seg id="2801">Source: CanDoAction </seg>
<seg id="2802">Since the start of the 2011 Syrian revolution and subsequent civil war, many cities around Syria fell victim to harsh sieges and blockades, primarily by forces loyal to the Assad regime. </seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of peace organization PAX and research institution The Syria Institute, there are about 1 million Syrians currently living under siege in areas of Damascus, Rural Damascus, Homs, Deir Ezzor, and Idlib governorates. </seg>
<seg id="2804">One area hit particularly hard is Eastern Ghouta, where a chemical weapon attack on August 21, 2013 left hundreds of civilians dead. </seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations, and the Syrian opposition conclude &#8212; based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights groups &#8212; that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime. </seg>
<seg id="2806">This part of rebel-held Syria right outside of Damascus has been under siege since 2013, leaving residents to rely on food produced locally or smuggled in through tunnels or across checkpoints. </seg>
<seg id="2807">Years of regime blockade have put traditional staples like meat far beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. </seg>
<seg id="2808">In response, a group of Syrian humanitarians and academics are educating residents of Eastern Ghouta to cultivate their own mushrooms "as a lifesaving source of food." </seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Al Nahda and the project is in coordination with another local NGO called the Adala Foundation. </seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not among common crops in Syria, and are rarely featured in local cuisine, but their relative benefits have made them an appealing source of food for many in besieged Eastern Ghouta. </seg>
<seg id="2811">The project's director, Abu Nabil, told news agency AFP: </seg>
<seg id="2812">We turned to cultivating mushrooms because they're a food that has high nutritional value, similar to meat, and can be grown inside houses and basements. </seg>
<seg id="2813">Speaking to Global Voices, one of the organizers, Dr. Ahmed Leila, said they have been struggling to make this project known for the past three years and expressed relief at it "finally seeing the light". </seg>
<seg id="2814">They have been using the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo, in coordination with the NGO Ghiras Al-Nahda, to raise funds for their initiative. </seg>
<seg id="2815">Dr. Leila told Global Voices that the project plans to teach 125 families to grow mushrooms. </seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of writing, they had reached over 100% of their expected goal of approximately 14,800 US dollars, but will continue to receive donations on CanDo until Monday, September 4, 2017. </seg>
<seg id="2817">This endeavor relies on generators to maintain temperatures stable at 25 degrees and the humidity in the air at 80%. </seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of short supplies of fuel, these generators are fed with a locally produced fuel that is extracted from plastic. </seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they started by "producing seeds from mushrooms that grow naturally in the region" before examining them and assessing their quality and suitability to be consumed. </seg>
<seg id="2820">They then built a small mushroom farm in a tub, and when this worked, they moved on to a bigger tub, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="2821">Now, they have "designed an educational farm for the region". </seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the start of this project, and over a period of three months, they have distributed mushrooms across Eastern Ghouta free of charge. </seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it's part of a wider movement to educate. </seg>
<seg id="2824">"We work to teach people how to grow mushrooms for several reasons": 1- Breaking the Siege. </seg>
<seg id="2825">2- Providing a new food source on the market. </seg>
<seg id="2826">3- Spreading the culture of self-sustenance by benefiting from the remains at homes (like paper, tea, coffee ground, carton etc) and convert it to food. </seg>
<seg id="2827">4- Employing more of the labour force, especially women working from home. </seg>
<seg id="2828">5- Employing those with specia needs who are restricted to their homes. </seg>
<seg id="2829">He added that they're hoping to "spread this idea to the world so that they know our success as well as our struggle with hunger and the siege. </seg>
<seg id="2830">We want our experience to inspire other trouble regions so that we can help humankind." </seg>
<seg id="2831">The interview with Dr. Ahmed Leila was conducted by Joey Ayoub and translated by Elias Abou Jaoude. </seg>

<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and around 70 were injured in forest fires on 15-16 October, leading the government to declare three days of mourning for the victims and their famillies. </seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also reported in the Spanish region of Galicia, where four people died. </seg>
<seg id="2836">An estimated 500 fires have spread through Portugal's northern and central regions, burning around 250,000 hectares of forests and affecting various villages. </seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy took place in Pedrógão Grande &#8212; a municipality in the center of the country &#8212; with fires leaving 64 dead and more than 200 injured. </seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European Forest Fire Information System, which monitors forested areas via satellite images, around 500,000 hectares of forest have burned in 2017 alone – an area roughly twice the size of the district of Lisbon. </seg>
<seg id="2839">To understand the seriousness of the situation, only 4 districts have no fires. </seg>
<seg id="2840">Portugal is literally burning </seg>
<seg id="2841">Images of the tragedy were shared on Twitter: </seg>
<seg id="2842">This is Braga tonight </seg>
<seg id="2843">Various videos were shared online and they gave glimpses of the devastation: </seg>
<seg id="2844">A tragedy forewarned </seg>
<seg id="2845">The aims of Saturday’s protests were to demand better state measures to prevent and fight fires. </seg>
<seg id="2846">Questions were raised over the inability of the civil protection service to control the tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral, of the Confederation of Farmers of Portugal, told the newspaper Público: </seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, they closed streets and evacuated villages for everything and nothing. </seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday, they did not do this anywhere, there were tens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire. </seg>
<seg id="2850">In Leiria's forests there could have been a tragedy similar to that of June because they only closed roads very late. </seg>
<seg id="2851">The protesters also called into question the many years that construction permits were given to projects in high fire risk zones. </seg>
<seg id="2852">A proposal of stricter forestry reform presented by the government &#8212; after large fires in 2003 and 2005 &#8212; was questioned by councils, which complained that the rule was a barrier to investment. </seg>
<seg id="2853">“The government introduced a flexibilization of the law that authorized constructions on a case by case basis, depending on whether or not the applicant had means of self-protection – there was an open door for anything to be built”, added João Sorval, in the same report by Público. </seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization, Quercus, brought attention to the large areas of eucalyptus, a tree of highly flammable wood whose growth, ironically, tends to expand after fires of this type. </seg>
<seg id="2855">On top of the growing list of issues, during the 15-16 October fires, citizens who attempted to look for information or tried to contact relatives on the website of Portugal’s Civil Protection, found that the site was offline. </seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that assumed the role of sharing information; using the civil protection’s own data, the application Fogos.pt informed people of the location of fires and their status in real time. </seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was created in 2015 by the programmer João Pina to facilitate the work of firefighters, and it became so important during that fateful October weekend that servers could not manage the 400,000 users and the 1.5 million views it received. </seg>
<seg id="2858">Its founder even asked for help: </seg>

<seg id="2861">In the end, Google contributed to help keep the website running: </seg>

<seg id="2863">There have also been numerous tributes to the firefighters who have been working tirelessly to fight the flames. </seg>
<seg id="2864">The firefighters are our heroes! </seg>
<seg id="2865">Enormous pride! </seg>
<seg id="2866">Impossible to remain indifferent to this tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="2867">Solidarity with relatives and friends of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="2868">Total support for the firefighters risking their lives to help in the best way possible. Whether the Portuguese government will heed the cries of its people is anyone’s guess, but in the meantime, the country continues to burn. </seg>

<seg id="2873">On an autumn night in 1994, the Taliban were getting ready to conquer Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="2874">Only two years before, a terrible civil war had broken out among the different Mujahideen factions that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government, turning the country into a wasteland of terror and despair. </seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time, in a small village in Ghazni province in central-eastern Afghanistan, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy from the Hazara ethnic group was having his final supper with his family. </seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn’t express it, she knew she would not see her son again for a long time—possibly ever. </seg>
<seg id="2877">The boy’s departure was set for dawn. </seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle was to pick him up and take to the smugglers. </seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0 </seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hazara-dominated Hezb-e-Wahdat political faction had just been assassinated by the Taliban, and many Hazaras felt suddenly vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, renowned for their hatred of the Hazara, was closing in. </seg>
<seg id="2886">Hazaras were leaving the country en masse, some for Pakistan, others for Iran. </seg>
<seg id="2887">Days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine, a job that left him sick and exhausted. </seg>
<seg id="2889">After that he took his meagre earnings and went to Iran, where he found himself once more in a foreign land among other refugees, carrying mortar sacks heavier than himself for a living. </seg>
<seg id="2890">Then, as now, the plight of Afghan refugees in Iran was one of hardship and exploitation. </seg>
<seg id="2891">“It was a tough situation," recalled Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. </seg>
<seg id="2892">"We (Afghan refugees) were living in the empty building site we were working on, there were no services and no heat, we put some nylon on the open windows to try not to die from cold during the night.” </seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his undocumented life in Iran behind and readied himself to travel to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="2894">Following a perilous journey by sea, he found himself castaway on a tiny, uninhabited Greek island. </seg>
<seg id="2895">In 2002, after being turned down for asylum by the Greek authorities, Asharaf finally reached Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2896">Asharaf wandered the streets of Rome for a while, homeless, sleeping in parks and having meals in a church that distributed food to the less fortunate twice a day. </seg>
<seg id="2897">While it is true that Italy has become something of a second-chance destination for failed asylum seekers due to relatively high approval rates, it is also true that the conditions into which asylum seekers are received are dire. </seg>
<seg id="2898">According to the NGO Civil Liberties Union for Europe, "the system suffers from a general lack of transparency. </seg>
<seg id="2899">The huge majority of asylum seekers is hosted in the more than 3000 'extraordinary reception centers', which are improvised structures in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." </seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can access accommodation centers only after they are formally registered, a process that can drag on for months after an asylum application is initiated. </seg>
<seg id="2901">During this period, people who can’t afford to pay for accommodation must seek recourse to friends’ hospitality, or resort to sleeping rough. </seg>
<seg id="2902">This is the fate that befell Asharaf. </seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible spirit prevented him from being down and out for too long. </seg>
<seg id="2904">After years working in various jobs in the construction sector, Asharaf poured his savings into a establishing a hostel in Venice. </seg>
<seg id="2905">It was such a success that after a while he opened a second hostel and a takeaway restaurant. </seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Barati’s story is now the subject of a documentary called “Behind Venice Luxury – a Hazara in Italy”, directed by Amin Wahidi. </seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the 24th Venice City Award in 2017. </seg>

<seg id="2911">In Italy, entrepreneurs, especially those who are not Italian nationals, face an uphill battle. </seg>
<seg id="2912">Red tape, high taxes and access to credit are among the major obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="2913">According to an unofficial estimate, there are around 20,000 Afghans in Italy. </seg>
<seg id="2914">For many the country is a stopgap option en route to other European destinations. </seg>
<seg id="2915">But in recent years a number of Afghan-run businesses have sprung up, including tailoring establishments, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have won acclaim in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine. </seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice there is the restaurant Orient Experience, the brainchild of Hamed Ahmadi, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from various parts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2918">They tell the story of their journey to Italy through Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes on the restaurant's menu. </seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari has established a new restaurant in Padua called Peace&amp;Spice, and Afghans are also behind the Kabulogna pizzeria in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome. </seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharaf's own ambitions stretch far beyond the Italian hospitality and retail sectors, back to the land he left under duress as teenager. </seg>
<seg id="2921">“Where there is risk there is opportunity,” Asharaf says with a smile. </seg>
<seg id="2922">“I want to invest in Afghanistan, I have never forgotten my country and I can’t live happily knowing that my people are suffering. </seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning to start a project for the farmers of the poorest provinces of the country, especially women. </seg>
<seg id="2924">They comprise half of society and must have the same opportunity as others." </seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also has plans to open a factory in Kabul where people can to learn packaging and conservation practices. "In this way," he says, "they will be able to sell their surplus products to the market and improve their financial situation.” </seg>
<seg id="2926">The journey of the successful entrepreneur follows a path from insecurity and doubt to stability and prosperity. </seg>
<seg id="2927">Having made that journey himself, Asharaf now wants to help Afghanistan make it too. </seg>

<seg id="2929">Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, has been imprisoned for more than 900 days whilst covering the clearance of Cairo's Raba'a el Adaweya camp in support to ousted president Mohamed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo shared on Twitter by @Ciluna27. </seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in Internet rights around the world. </seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament is reviewing a bill that would require social media users in Egypt to register with a government authority in order to use social media websites including Facebook and Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2933">Within six months of the law's adoption, users would have to register on the authority's website with their real names and state ID numbers to be able to use social media networks. </seg>
<seg id="2934">Failure to do so could bring punishment of up to six months in jail and a fine. </seg>
<seg id="2935">The bill, which has been endorsed by 60 members of parliament, is awaiting discussion by the parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it is referred for plenary debate. </seg>
<seg id="2936">On 8 May, another MP submitted a draft law that would introduce harsher penalties for those convicted of insulting the president and high ranking officials. </seg>
<seg id="2937">Egyptian law already criminalizes insults to the president and state institutions, however the proposed draft law would impose jail time and harsher fines, according to legal experts at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy. </seg>
<seg id="2938">The law’s approval could mean those convicted of insulting the president would face up to three years in jail. </seg>
<seg id="2939">If approved, these laws would undergird a political climate in which rights to free speech and assembly have already been under persistent threat for many years. </seg>
<seg id="2940">One prominent example is the case of popular photographer Mahmoud Abu Zeid (known as Shawkan) who was arrested in August 2013, while photographing Egyptian security officers using undue force against protesters who were opposing the military coup that removed elected president Mohammed Morsi from power. </seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan has been in pre-trial detention for nearly four years, awaiting trial alongside more than 700 protesters who were arrested in the same incident. </seg>
<seg id="2942">The trial was most recently postponed to 20 May, due to prison authorities’ failure to bring the accused from jail to the courtroom, rights groups reported. </seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan could face the death penalty for what rights groups widely agree are trumped-up charges, including weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder. </seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in the city of Giza acquitted journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary, who were arrested for their coverage of a pro-Morsi sit-in at Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the sentences of Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa, and Mohamed al-Adly–all arrested in the same incident, from 25 years to five years. </seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist interrogated over leaked documents </seg>
<seg id="2947">On 3 May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours interrogating Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and of Global Voices’ Advocacy project. </seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was questioned primarily about a leaked action plan from the Presidency of the Republic, which indicated strong support by the president for a controversial draft law that would grant amnesty to business people and officials accused of corruption during the regime of former dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, provided that they return any unlawfully obtained funds. </seg>
<seg id="2949">Nawaat published the document, which sheds light on the presidency's strategies to lobby support for the bill, on 21 April. </seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia has refused to reveal his sources in accordance with Article 11 of the country’s press code, which grants journalists source protection. </seg>
<seg id="2951">However, on May 9 he appeared before a primary court in Tunis, as a witness in the case. </seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China make social mediaites show ID at the door? </seg>
<seg id="2953">Chinese social media users may need to obtain a permit before writing or distributing news on social media, according to new regulations issued by the State Council Information Office. </seg>
<seg id="2954">The regulations also contain a real name registration provision, which several analysts speculate are intended to eliminate anonymous commenting from social media news threads. </seg>
<seg id="2955">It is unclear how authorities plan to implement the regulation–it seems nearly impossible to do so at scale. </seg>
<seg id="2956">On social media, Chinese netizens suggested that the rules will be enforced only selectively, to restrain independent and citizen journalism. </seg>
<seg id="2957">See you on WeChat? </seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="2959">On May 4, Russia’s federal censor blocked WeChat, China’s largest mobile messaging app. </seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the federal government as an “information-dissemination organizer.” </seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law under which the Russian government manages a list of online services that “organize the dissemination of information” and can hold them responsible for removing content and disclosing user data at the request of authorities. </seg>
<seg id="2962">Today, this list includes websites like Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2ch.hk, the email client Mail.ru and dozens of other services. </seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court orders Wikipedia offline </seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered Wikipedia blocked in Turkey after site administrators refused to remove two English language pages that claimed Turkey channeled support to jihadists in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="2965">According to the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, the site was blocked for “becoming an information source acting with groups conducting a smear campaign against Turkey in the political arena”. </seg>
<seg id="2966">This is the first time that the country has fully blocked the site, joining China as one of a few countries in the world to block Wikipedia entirely. </seg>
<seg id="2967">The UK can’t stop snooping </seg>
<seg id="2968">The UK government is in the midst of a ‘targeted consultation’ regarding increased surveillance powers that would force ISPs to monitor communications real time and install backdoors to break encryption, according to documents leaked this week. </seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted with telecom companies and intelligence agencies on the draft, but not with other tech companies or civil society. </seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite this, the consultation remains open through 19 May, and responses from members of the public may be sent to the Home Office. </seg>

<seg id="2985">About 60-70 people attended the vigil, according to Wong. </seg>
<seg id="2986">"So many friends came and showed their love,” wrote Wong in a post on messaging platform WeChat on Wednesday morning. </seg>

<seg id="2990">Around 190 LGBTQ organisations in China signed a joint statement on the massacre published on Monday. </seg>

<seg id="2995">Blued, the most popular gay dating app in China, changed its loading screen to say “we stand with Orlando.” </seg>
<seg id="2996">“The LGBT crowd is part of the human race’s big family. </seg>
