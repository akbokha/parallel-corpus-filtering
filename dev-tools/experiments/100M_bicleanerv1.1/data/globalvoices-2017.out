although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , dance to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who faced the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his view he never stops behind the mountain , as it is said .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people re@@ acted to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I was not able to reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schauung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles for life for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me as her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Ash@@ ley , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tr@@ ump took his way to the nom@@ in@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in another way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most of them are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( editor &apos;s note ) : as much as &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; the white and whi@@ plas@@ h word match , which means so much like trauma trauma , as the big van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white American of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land now , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what does the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places not only changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding her musical instruments .
a music school with 100 pupils has become the central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ingly and with gl@@ it@@ tering eyes and play in the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle and play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with recycled instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have started turning parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all produced from rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin @-@ made violin .
today there is an orchestra consisting of instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follows the orchestra with its inspiring drama of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats illegal illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication happens within the scope of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to b@@ ap@@ tise one of their har@@ bours and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are the six countries alongside Somalia and Madagascar , who had driven the prime minister out of their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries like mind and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also circul@@ ated by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are done in real time , with track@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea with satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , such suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such examinations can show if the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ish@@ ments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm campaig@@ ning for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year lose due to illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , quot@@ ing of fanta@@ sies , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a completely organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front function .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has exposed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eing ships .
because of its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international crime control agency , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , helps to track down the illegal ships that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conc@@ eal their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting vessels with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organization : a platform that provides satellite data and allows the position of every single tracking ship worldwide to be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ri@@ mental but also deter them .
ships that were previously un@@ licensed and hardly expected to predict consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now seen a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped Somalia to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are an object of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear annually through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now comb@@ ating illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with certainty , the aim is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia could report its first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only was the ship on the move without a license and were used tow nets that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method to protect the oceans really works across the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; reg@@ aining the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s office .
this picture of MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government had rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum in office , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis , responded by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the refund of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central North of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country is continually wor@@ sen@@ ing , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the everyday life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the re @-@ election of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the sec@@ rec@@ y of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government &apos;s decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum on minist@@ erial activity was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance , Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica , or short MU@@ D ( such as : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called upon a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , to continue to block the referendum on office .
the call was commented on Twitter among others as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday Higher civilian strike and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

on Twitter images that talk about arguments , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the government according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic has already made the round that forms the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office , which was now shown in the eyes of many people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your term of office !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from their point of view , took little action against the devastating economic crisis and pre@@ tended to be mu@@ til@@ ated by critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now spoken against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investigated crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not yet realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
make sure they don &apos;t kidn@@ ap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little pack@@ et wrapped up in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big lum@@ ps of silver in it .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in it and saw a couch tor@@ tured on man .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
she seldom holds a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty g@@ utter .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another person ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian , who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man there and killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the civilian Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , confirmed the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ ts came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be moved .
this was a lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; back then at the age of old I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boot@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military signs , which one takes away from an enemy that one has fought .

but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a spo@@ ils of war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you , who cou@@ gh@@ ing cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you by yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so was my father .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle neck jum@@ per of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to cancel .
&apos;@@ the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you see the value of a life .
one continues to develop and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why the bodies disappear ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl to his house , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to whom you could pass your mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act which can be done to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , of course , anything remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie himself .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked myself what all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , then I am sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I ref@@ unded the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I ended up saying against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes perpet@@ rated between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police members and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked for years for justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research for it lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be established there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in K@@ YO@@ TO , where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was distributed in social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , witnessed a very un@@ fortunate translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with bad background thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1st to 20th September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t for elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faulty English translation has been removed first . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if gram@@ mati@@ cally not completely correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is a reason to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by senior citizens increased during the same period .
the name @-@ called repor@@ ter published comments on the light in the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
among others , the article on the translation error received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to have an active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , who could produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of native English speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ alized and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences that arise by mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , which often ad@@ orn T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . however , by major companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more accurate translations can be expected .
the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television take
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Surf ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the online broad@@ ca@@ ster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups , who resist@@ ed the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests commen@@ ced at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and deleg@@ ated the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the link was app@@ reh@@ ended and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offerings such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially during periods of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting protests since 2014 . at that time the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ S@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a block@@ age of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters .
earlier research by the Institute for Media and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds correctly or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked canal , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was taken into custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been informed that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an audience more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers witnesses of other Cri@@ mes that have been victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind approval of structural .
the following article is the shortened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she could not eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Cri@@ mean tas .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money handed over their minor son or their minor daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay for this countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up .
the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean tas , especially young girls affected by the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice - collected witnesses , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated to the Cri@@ mean is generally not to remain silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family that their daughter in the belief that they conclude their education , improve their position in society , and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation by faith , is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was in charge of the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a cler@@ k at the registration office .
Mar@@ Ã­n was living with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest r@@ allies and demanded that there would be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more cows than children are registered in Paraguay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for rapid investigation of the fall .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the Every@@ day Life of a Cri@@ min@@ ta
the cri@@ es are exploited not only as labour , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the far@@ bik , in which their father worked , had to sign up bank@@ rupt@@ cy and their father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ mean to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share time so that she had time to learn .
she got up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school ended , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the host than eating out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and to read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , they explained .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ings exposed to Cri@@ mes when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ mean .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody home . I had no circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships emerge , I particularly felt that I was not part of any group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job ads for cleaning personnel and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the group administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please report to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author switched on once again :
dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ k@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ mean tas , how long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mes , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history , we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , who gave them tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination , and the system of the Mens@@ Ãº ( where the workers were treated as half @-@ slaves ) , and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill submitted to Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty @-@ six Egyptian MPs have recently approved a draft bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regulation concerning use and benefits of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by parliament , users and users of social media must be registered in Egypt at a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established which is in charge of granting citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register their correct names and identity numbers on the website of the site in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months &apos; imprisonment or a fine .
the draft law , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video teaching and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate regulation at the stage of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications Ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of that it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it has not yet been known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Senior Research Engineer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request a permit or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was fores@@ een for those who are found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish natural prot@@ ector protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq from war

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , Ti@@ ersch@@ us@@ erin H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the bigger family of the Leop@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . all in all , there are between 800 and 1.000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks out pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which is not only made up of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the North East of Japan , documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of Japan &apos;s pre@@ f@@ ecture , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami resulting from it .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbors Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map .
even so , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years afterwards to re@@ build local residents &apos; lives .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese recovery authority as well as the survey results of the victims themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( for the most part ) , were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed here .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el Accommodation ( to the fore ) , one still endeav@@ ours to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in this case . more than 75 percent of ev@@ acu@@ ated people , who were hau@@ led after the disaster in shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortun@@ es opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fisher@@ y ports in I@@ wa@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fisher@@ y ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in i@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , for only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ lands belonging to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma stays far away as well .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ wa@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants have felt more difficult to earn their living .
is the indigenous population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated people . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how their feelings had changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63@@ ,000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement houses .
after 2017 , there are still 40,000 residents of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated , who are still living in Beh@@ el Accommodation , are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma must compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when you meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
as a result of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has strengthened the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma after being beaten down by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included in the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer was beaten with a stick against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked using a stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s reported that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from active service .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and all the repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs soon rush towards him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; police violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police had sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who hit him with a stick .
police hand@@ gri@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only State in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against prot@@ esters last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , police officers installed a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disk .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to make a photo of their pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ forgotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the Western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and commu@@ te every day to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who is open every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the municipality saw already better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar should remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cu@@ ban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the shut@@ down of 98 sugar@@ cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
the first letters began before the first year of scho@@ oling .
these were officially recorded documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was passed on and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories , which were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .

in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use for five years , everything would run well .

after two years , the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to mi@@ tig@@ ate them , they also stopped to asp@@ ire to the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
welcome to a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with the permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities across Canada focus on topics that are important to them . they do it with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , since 2014 workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop hon@@ ours the young participants in discussions on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the State of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of T@@ ears , a street section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although teenagers do not always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ sk@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and go ahead of our youth as well .
so they can do what they intended for the Creator

in Japan plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for the most part ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , close to the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( which is the subject of the &quot; me@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; ) are presented by any dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic meals and decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i there are a variety of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning them today into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin pur@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phone bands decorated with plastic rib@@ bons as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone @-@ stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station .
and here is an apple holding your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ic .
some cell phone stands and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing che@@ ats ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic bags can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against the drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ si@@ sts and trans@@ missions regularly appear only in statistics . they do not , however , reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
behind every cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ end@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Fear To Life Chang@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez who lost their father , four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set before us to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because now I &apos;m alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay her out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ens@@ a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the titles with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wat@@ ered up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t move and are still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of ex@@ tor@@ tion in the capital district : how a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; it describes how armed criminals pressed money off their business month by month , until they had torn down not only the business , but also demoli@@ shed their family .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain on it never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because they don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself if tears would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was missing .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories live on the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ens@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand imper@@ vious words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this article and the pages to which he links contain pictures depicting violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but how is the year after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong combination of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , it fell victim to that of the tan@@ ker lor@@ ries .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie theater near , which was full of people watching the football world championship .
houses burned and char@@ med cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here history does not end .
over the years the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses told dras@@ tically about atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Res@@ ident on Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be visu@@ alized on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ resolved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from DR Congo appeared again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented regulations for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments like this example fal@@ sely linked the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash report published by the United Nations , those who could flee could be pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts were like the following , bringing together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo :
this picture originates from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page that mistakenly claimed President Burma &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ ze this information .
the original article , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations calling AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein Sein to this statement , but had not related the image from DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false creations reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18,@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have forwarded false reports , some others have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have enclosed examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which side they have been published . thus , we want to show the reach more clearly than by language alone .
several examples of impro@@ per use may come from the countries listed below ( some of which are also linked to each other in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of wrong coupl@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show for@@ gery samples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only ren@@ ames the mis@@ information , but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cris@@ ti@@ an@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article on explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La re@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ bei@@ ations@@ after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am as this one , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this .

Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims via the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old@@ town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o von Tren@@ to posted this message on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy of the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pursued , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a lev@@ y on what they found as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ alized news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this correction , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors operated by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often widespread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adren@@ aly@@ sis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar gave Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) .
the image of DR Congo emerged with this ts@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , which allegedly took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ ched ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums became like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false report .
from the message in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gra@@ y ) , Tin@@ Eye also points but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original publication of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence associated with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers cannot believe in these images any longer .
with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ intentionally share water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the actual horror of what happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images from a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images will des@@ ensi@@ tise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ olog@@ ues are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used in the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ des ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ rem@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example , words from the Ta@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - take care of your parents in recognition of how you care about yourself in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hun@@ sr@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they dec@@ eive other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite topics here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka re@@ acts with the worst floo@@ ding in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood disaster and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya moved over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the disaster relief centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundred people are missing because of the floods and mud waves .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been placed at 304 safe places of residence .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the crisis of the Den@@ gue crisis , warns the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stopped in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ o@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water p@@ eg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and other five are ready to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ ba .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need assistance in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood help &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for retri@@ eval of assistance and donations . they were then sent free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people with floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring security and assistance to residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girl in January .
I entr@@ ust to her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children : she is my rock in the br@@ anding .
in the last minute we are still calling slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next , we will have rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and humans , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others sk@@ id@@ ding slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have met me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built up in their conception .
they are mi@@ tig@@ ating me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is designed so well in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who like me don &apos;t fit into it , are being mi@@ tig@@ ated .
to be mi@@ tig@@ ated
I am not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures do you think of when you think of him ?
love ? what &apos;s your love ?
peace ? yes , peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1,7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist paintings of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist , Edward S@@ aid , sh@@ attered the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ rate them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ ration weak@@ ens mus@@ cl@@ ine women who are leading movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ lessly , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims account for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants origin@@ ating from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were un@@ wit@@ ted Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , whom all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ ish , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears the head of a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging .
it attacks our identity , which is so wide , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only then born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf , that I &apos;m Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I weigh her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to protect those who seal the Qur &apos;@@ an and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

approved use .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother on the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how to win a contest of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and incomplete paintings of the old Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means speaking the prayers she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that has been colon@@ ized through an &quot; Empire &quot; for centuries , which a company founded with the name of honor @-@ worthy British East @-@ Len@@ i @-@ company , it has a deep meaning to name God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family , who could not close his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at play risk .
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; colonial &quot; all the way up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot &apos;s bomb of history was thrown over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir sub @-@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the Radi@@ cal Word of Love , Peace and Social Justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged story .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is lie buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties which are inherent in multiple lines , but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from the countries that are bombing it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely respects Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw off to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically un@@ true picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous print@@ outs that we make in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; S@@ apphire Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print increasingly Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing where we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before it had not yet existed ; now they are domin@@ ating large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story which I was not aware of when I was old , as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a bread cr@@ umb track in my speech .
things that may evo@@ ke memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity may lie to a story where someone is being made &quot; others . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conver@@ sions take place at the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why don &apos;t I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , was even scientist of Stan@@ ford , four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and unconscious the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already captured countries and &quot; to other &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
history stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it often involves understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , feel , touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers set their story in their own language first and then translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their presentation make the audience feel the same .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the F@@ abel of the H@@ oses and the Bab@@ oon in the Sh@@ ona language of Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were alert ...
they were all with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .

it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front for the Ne@@ uro @-@ Testing of Deb@@ t ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of re@@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debt will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be ref@@ unded with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not integrated into the state alliance - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit Non @-@ Profit Organization without Party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration called the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gi@@ l for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture organized in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of books completed within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : collective research ) .
the book that was published last year and is freely available here contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book wants to discuss how movements can be set up for free knowledge and what are the true costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked alongside site to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own fate , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
in this process , what have we given up from times to extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; had taken Bas@@ el on the basis of a command of the military tri@@ bunal drawn from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototype was more pro@@ active than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the sign of numerous civili@@ zations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles are mer@@ ging with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began his work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak good English .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for a year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your ad@@ orable eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace us ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the haz@@ ards ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guards
I forget the prison crowds
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
whom I carry with passion with me ,
if your eyes fail to say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile over your absence .
I convince myself that I will soon return ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year passes , my soul
during the summer season
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International since 2011 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our call for hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : convic@@ ted Director after release res@@ ig@@ ned on previous post
Mos@@ ambique responded with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in the state machine where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants due to mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tics ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose council was ruled by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his res@@ ignation to the company , which took place on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the firm was not subject to any disciplinary action .
however , many residents do not welcome the action .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary action against the contrary .
the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent person , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off .
he could keep paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to pay for his silence .
in a disgu@@ sting way !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ic@@ ans and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn &apos;t have any mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already so mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the morality to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it were an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Pr@@ el prison will not only remain in memory for the Moz@@ kan@@ ers as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is also criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
he was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and he was free .
and today the company , in which he dec@@ ei@@ ves funds , sets him under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ jet@@ ko@@ ye ( @ az@@ zy _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 . may 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo of the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( dt . : @ Truth ) states that crimin@@ ality pays off in Moz@@ ambique :
in fact , to be in # Moz@@ ambique th@@ ief and atten@@ dant of # F@@ rel@@ im@@ o , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long term detention , returns to # airports of Moz@@ ambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ sam@@ bo ) 11 . may 2017
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or chips . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network received their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East India or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings which have the same letter order as &apos; Cal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ inter@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ u@@ ter A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ itt believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before releasing all the posts suspected of being rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the opposite words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spread hate speech , get a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to extingu@@ ish his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook gui@@ deline , I made a post to tell my friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to post , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they discovered that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is to intensi@@ fy violence in communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at more in context rather than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finished with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .

the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ related age is now 18 .
prior to this change of the married couple , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 there came to a large public scre@@ am . back then , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that , age does not possess the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and at 18 , it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married in 19 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements eager to aboli@@ sh laws of children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . without doubt they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there came doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the chil@@ dr@@ ens was decided - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted by 35 votes in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and not a single vote against it .
after being approved by the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of the chil@@ dr@@ ens were finally changed .
Lov@@ ell Francis , a member of the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk about the cru@@ x of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ dd@@ ler is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel was thinking it was definitely long enough to get the practice off , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had come :
public Status Update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law of the married couple has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was :
the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the design for the change of the marriage network was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chil@@ dr@@ ens are legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ like shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all the activists who fought against him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the general secretary of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation in the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed , and he seems to release his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as general , in a way that can only cause panic and disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , if we , instead of speaking of the problem , would say that the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are facing them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or the norm in different levels , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

after China , Turkey is the second @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform cleared all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship quite difficult .
the content is still available in spite of the legal ban .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we were able to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed ways .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ Page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices , as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you are accessing a different URL that is not the original . that which you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a Su@@ h@@ len@@ des Nas@@ horn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to take a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten up the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring the animal world to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called to Navar@@ ra ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was found and I immediately started to kin@@ dle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood up to face with Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to make recordings of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could shoot a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist accommodation .
see some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to speak the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with great care avoid speaking the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to the social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a false tri@@ bunal and rejected his family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with a name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is common among men . however , they have far fewer allow@@ ances to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the breakdown of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS @-@ infected persons , and manages these clubs .
she tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves .
saying that the names of their hus@@ bands don &apos;t speak lou@@ dly , is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not with@@ hold this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she all asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she secured only herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to let out the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ alin to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as carrying the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women need to show that they are married ?
I told my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every disc@@ us club we make a trip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never said so hon@@ estly about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say things loud , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ one @-@ Kur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt over a trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of its own dress code , morality combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed its own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could carry it .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini sure they will do it .
the question of whether in the five months since her first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it for a couple of times , but then stopped to tell the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ ag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was a part of the feast for the Beat@@ les memorial day in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail@@ er Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan is today . for the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo .
still today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese Kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beat@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are the 5 places you absolutely need to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges sometimes cannot be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! embark@@ ed on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
and of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market technology , such as this r@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is how the day is going to run .
so , we hope you &apos;re here !
follow the h@@ ash@@ tag that ki@@ cks off to find out more about the Beat@@ les memorial day .
bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambique &apos;s target of attacks .
photo : different bolt / fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently used to make use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia was decl@@ aring the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of murder for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN launched a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
be@@ ware of bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are aimed at ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambique police warned of the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ hed Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said the local police were already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ ma@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in the last days three men with hair loss problems were killed in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Moz@@ ambique faces :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , TH@@ AT I am ashamed of having sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would be ashamed or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men are hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and thri@@ lled Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ ma@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambique officials are very concerned about the murder of bald men . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences towards his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , took Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) to expand public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting for Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who out@@ war@@ ded himself as an insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ sels &apos;s residence and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are showing the honour of creating Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the Open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of protests against Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights organisation .
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been put to death in custody , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made only recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China referred Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have fully gone out of the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
United Nations Anno@@ un@@ ces
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway Finn@@ ish@@ ness in Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his award in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union Member of the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she announced in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to elev@@ ate all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it assists him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy invited a fur@@ ious response from China , with the external ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told the couple that China should offer the following :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing were reported to the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit in Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s advoc@@ ate told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those involved in the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s State Department urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an Declaration on 29 June :
all necessary actions must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan in Taiwan
the Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator , Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u , of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual le@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama : Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was severely punished had led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noticed that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore to be regarded as a city .
... nobody asked whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who prefer to be democr@@ ats , leave the twi@@ sted logic because it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam there were answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really no answers .
he answered such questions with non @-@ answers in a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clear his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country is our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the critics concerning the fact that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was more of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sei no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed by what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of Singapore &apos;s political leaders , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that really associates and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review breaks down the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a che@@ ek@@ y spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who needs to pay back our prime minister invoices ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade zur Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to be a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world uncovered and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which the conversation occurs , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly rage when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differ from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all lovers Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we evi@@ dently say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country for ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
firstly : being called a &quot; nice &quot; means to be sk@@ id@@ able - just like the nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go far enough to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
we are missing the warm , open friendliness that I am now connecting with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau em@@ bed the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ das Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that de@@ codes the j@@ un@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and , in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man telling what rules his girlfriend does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 songs .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the supreme commander of the army an absolute decision on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons considered by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activ@@ ist and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to super@@ vise the online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand sets a stri@@ k@@ ingly against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Survey ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax subsidies .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the sal@@ ute from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society is recovered very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Gulf of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Sou@@ theast Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the majority of Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after a decade has barely risen .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ story residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ ire and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all serving the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ov@@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in my hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
the district administration offers free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses Mig@@ rants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19th April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold coloured earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you from Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cardboard outside .
she does not want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have lived in Brazil but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests send her often text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chi@@ ckens like Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated to their small house .
it is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 persons are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela states that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to press him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an apartment and an unknown person , a single person , offered him a roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , travellers consult cal@@ m@@ ly their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she fli@@ rts with numerous photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair ties she has made an Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly introduces it to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you &apos;ve already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in announc@@ ing the police , the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remotely control your home network .
this app with the min@@ ors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while announcements about digital cens@@ orship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme en@@ grav@@ ings and monitoring measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police inspec@@ ting the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately checked whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use equipment intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( like in Deutsch ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description indicating that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent review of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at local police until 1 August .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qui &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and find out that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from the inside and from the outside .
one who gives honor to her name .
one that has put down a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of disaster . you realize that you are trapped somewhere between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the Chief of the Safety Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts revol@@ ved around , just my own .
for the first time , it was silent , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t set high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my home roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find them together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we united to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations in full .
in such a moment you become aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you have made it all the way to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was at my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smell of this cursed sentence lies in my nose until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I walked through the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I plan all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have given me a larger cell this time .
I have to share them with only one other prisoner and can immediately set me up without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ tried method of communication : beating against the wall with the f@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first det@@ ain@@ ee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks like me and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I stay .
a li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured in the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es rang every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13 verses of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ it@@ or and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that sli@@ pp@@ le him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you &apos;re still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those Ta@@ ge@@ thi@@ eves and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to not answer .
I can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had not done anything to deserve this punishment .
on penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the lovingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ fession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t compete with him and you can &apos;t hold back your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ aming isn &apos;t enough for him yet , why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I wonder@@ ed whether the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them alternate while I was still in the turn .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t take pleasure in it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two horri@@ ble hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he sl@@ um@@ bs to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel accomplished his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who is opposed to the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ tures .
with his music , which often deals with issues such as ori@@ tism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he h@@ ates a special a@@ version against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - he refers to himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured into water dissolved N@@ es@@ cafÃ© into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a fer@@ vent hot j@@ un@@ day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the sl@@ its talk of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the interior ministry Jord@@ ani@@ ens has cancelled a performance by the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the conc@@ erto .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the old @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simply sei@@ s@@ mic , but in fact reflect a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those who were supposed to trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honorary mur@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law to fight crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be held in prison for an in@@ definite period of time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the family &apos;s guarantee that the woman will not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been wor@@ sen@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repeatedly repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to later note that his comments were torn down , twi@@ sted and his opinion was cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but only a edited version was stre@@ amed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who later worked on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new any more that the government sanc@@ tion attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service adopted several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , stating that they have cri@@ tically commented on comments in social media concerning the problems associated with the corruption that is deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordan .
for him progress is constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , reas@@ oned and inner changes . he is sure that these changes will take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature on a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial demo@@ cra@@ cies .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the lor@@ ries , drums and dancing were passed over more than a thousand years ago , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ bas@@ sies , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ j@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fortress was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , out@@ ward appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more regular citizens going into the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these costly hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts face each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks of how to watch in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of getting a training in the bar@@ ber art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel fl@@ ab@@ by ?
exactly this question left the young Colom@@ bian milit@@ ants Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la @-@ li@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years and were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their arms around the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would close together and help with the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , which needed most urgent appeal .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support to former F@@ ARC comb@@ at@@ ants who now have their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the policy student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him firmly and seated myself next to the gar@@ net .
perhaps he was tired of war too , was tired of being the faithful companion of this warri@@ or all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I only learned how to handle weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together to a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC proclaimed the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the State affected the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this size it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing those people who have never found an ear and had no right to vote , and recogni@@ zing that the people whom I have often seen as a monster and even hated , are only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and done so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former warri@@ ors responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were proph@@ esi@@ ed that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also totally justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ lator talks about the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ ab@@ re@@ owa and whose first publication took place on the website OC Media .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which hangs over the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community there , has not been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that address the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she shed light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ lator , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
from her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned from the gender balance of their coun@@ try@@ woman , the ch@@ ase was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life , she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , made a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents went through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the rear seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which hospitals are you placed - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there &apos;s my male name on it , but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for that I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they wanted to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has corrupted not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother got too much and she laid a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering with me , without any ID , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : last week I filed a report in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who settled in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told us that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
they will most likely focus on family and relatives .
that is what I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to judge Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know , they will be held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so called Lord , this person was even present when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
I think I was already familiar with Gro@@ z@@ ny before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to approach the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , but finally threw us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had stained eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes je@@ ans and short loops .
the Ministry of Defence of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me even one hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ots not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say it to children , when they make fun with the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long was this time of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city started to change .
he who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that I am still active as activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ws , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t make a cent for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I par@@ ted breeding places .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is pure , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have which , the Cab@@ ar@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims living in the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think about transition to men who love men , and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different ways - two different kinds of feeling , in order to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is already last longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a sharp rise in suicide .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 re@@ marked the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who would like to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people made it quick to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on site warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have inv@@ aded this month .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and go on a safe work because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi Mon@@ archy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is developing only slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Director of Iranian Director for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and graduated 45 % from a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian family human rights activ@@ ist based in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi people .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
because function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pro@@ s and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the circumstances that the Arab ancestors must endure , human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even impose well @-@ thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * in general .
for example , women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination on the grounds of gender is still across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced that I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists were to remain silent .
yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; up@@ lift their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; in order to attain equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are subjected to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other ethnic origin and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black women and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injustice in her thinking , which refer to both the gender and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ n compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a terrible and margin@@ alised being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to dissolve myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that has been sum@@ mon@@ ed for my dark skin and status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so obst@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : claims ( such as Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we reg@@ ain ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and margin@@ alization after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement that the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this paradig@@ m .
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and because of my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life neither passed nor ignored nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports special about international efforts to resolve environmental problems .
within the scope of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a relates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , who uses and works to protect rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative Vide@@ ographie and new multimedia techniques , with the help of repres@@ sed communities that can tell their stories in their own way .
Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ tin . the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent to her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of abuse , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos;s well @-@ informed indication was nothing more useful .
a few days later , the second woman drew her ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women complain at all , they generally do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , are in general reported to the prosecution authorities .
content 1 blows and statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that do not sub@@ servi@@ ent 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate conversion be@@ atings and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; she explains .
however , the available figures are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence went to the District At@@ tor@@ ney General . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were over 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . here too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here .
in the ads 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed by their current or former partners each year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counting at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she still had to repent .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but for two years she inherited psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to identify :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described her insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had insul@@ ted her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed the so long of Carlos and did not leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least some inno@@ c@@ ence to it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paraguay Law : good Appro@@ ach , Im@@ proved Implem@@ entation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but cannot be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ing and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Elec@@ tor ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non Govern@@ ments ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d must explain and punish fem@@ ini@@ d as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the wording of the bill was changed in a number of ways in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions that is currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment .
the original bill fores@@ een that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence presently have to bear , if they simply only reimbur@@ se an ad and wish to obtain a secure housing , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ thinking must take place here , so that violence is no longer seen as normal .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away .
we need to refund so long that mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been amended , including a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
opinions on the changes are taking place .
the passage on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a major set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media continues to attack Oman a year after a newspaper &apos;s ban
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were arrested and brought to trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had replaced his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , along with his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has been suffering the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic secret services , to restrict public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , to intim@@ id@@ ate and protect human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , found an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties ties of the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
in the report , government officials accused of being pres@@ sured by the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the directive that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper on any way , including online , will be banned from August 9 , 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at on 26 September 2016 .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , because of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
beyond that , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on appeal and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was established and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the judgment .
the appeals court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he will serve his imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Defence to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Korean government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and which the Minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ establish the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities :
1 . immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their lawful human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf Region and adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and freedom of association as well as the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed a serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus even before he decided to go back home in order to support the Serbian healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment lies the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient , rather than being a leader .
the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , Big Data , Expl@@ oration of Space , Healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines only make articles accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ roll &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;

its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ action , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ tons &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ ef@@ ulness and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
patents vary not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cr@@ inkl@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ el varieties . as a result of this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but he now takes longer , because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river to d@@ wind@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far .
and if they stand up in court , nobody can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the US and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property so that plant bree@@ ders can be used permanently .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can obli@@ ge that other seeds bred by them can freely use seeds .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell them . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties and not immediately cut it out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
dark outlook and glo@@ omy prospects
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; the most recent examples include the mer@@ ges of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which , for example , is offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to growing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all card features is protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only ag@@ grav@@ ated .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are still patented in a larger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - such by which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders decreases through more and more patents . genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the altered conditions are much worse in terms of climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and vital for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property controls other bree@@ ders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight already .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers easier for farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and makes us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their cultivation , requires massive her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - they either reject patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years from competition , which makes it easy for me to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide response &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is an open source seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an open source licence , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it is against the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ ent@@ ate seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a world @-@ wide alliance for open source seed systems that will be the official launch scheduled for next year .
a combination of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , share it and improve seed policies to ensure stable food supply .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Ukrainian Wikipedia has chosen the eleven best photographers in the national part of the international photo competition &quot; Wi@@ ki Lo@@ ves Earth , &quot; which focuses on nature monuments and nature reserves .
the award ceremony took place on 7 October 2017 at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Kiev , where the winning photos were presented in an exhibition .
in the month of May , the Ukrainian part of the international competition received over 15,000 photos with more than 1,@@ 8@@ 60 motifs on the topic of natural heritage .
about one thousand of these images are already used in Wikipedia articles , which are published in different languages .

all winners received certificates as souvenirs and other prizes such as souvenirs with the competition logo or coup@@ ons for online shops .
the author of the 11 photos with the highest y@@ ur@@ y@@ worth as well as competition participants who took most of the objects and collect the most points in the total score were honored with the prizes .
other awards were awarded by other organisations who joined the competition .
for example , the staff of the National Park H@@ olo@@ si@@ i@@ v@@ sky@@ i , located in the metrop@@ olitan region of Kiev , have selected the three best photos taken in a private park and submitted to the competition .
in addition , there were also a number of special categories in the national competition : &quot; Un@@ pleasant Discovery , &quot; which documents the destruction of natural habitats , initiated by NGOs from the environmental sector , an overview of the topics where photos on Wikipedia were missing best wildlife photos and best Kiev photo .

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains faithful to its aim to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted in order to overcome the block@@ age and not to give up . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arabic @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website closures has fallen victim to . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt .
now the blog he was preparing to deal with the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with which Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog is given , is on the other hand accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting about the student protests and recording a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles focus primarily on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada commented on the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although blocking the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege , a detention , a attempted murder , a charge at the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other web site for which I was working .
2 ) You proved that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities opened 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of providers that was possible through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , known as Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions in court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed 14 @-@ year @-@ old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , nav@@ y and air tea to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new column called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against calling violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is , according to her opinion , a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold officers in charge of the police .
this is not war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - combined with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of public services . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

design@@ ating Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong , according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are located in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015 . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dram@@ as per federal state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has under@@ lined the state &apos;s security policy for many years .
one of these security policy measures was the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up in 2003 by the state of Rio in order to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . however , for several years the U@@ PP has been increasingly under attack after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio is not compliant with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week later , the police cleared up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot of the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime compared to loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
in particular , the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the fact that the United Nations and other human rights organisations have committed massac@@ res committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been besieg@@ ed outside of Damascus , leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on food produced locally or through tunnels and control points .
due to the many years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional crops planted in Syria and are very rarely part of Syrian cuisine . however , their food quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , told the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining popularity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families of knowledge for planting mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , the 4th September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel locally produced fuels from plastic are used to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la said that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) to extract new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege are visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis regions and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for 2017 victims of fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 bur@@ sts that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos alone , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civilian protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
in the woods of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with high risk of fire .
a wide @-@ ranging paper reform proposal introduced by the government after severe fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article from the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , behave like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to the fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when residents were seeking information or trying to contact their relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : the site counted more than half a million requests .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years before a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it that way then she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn the boy should break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found herself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and slu@@ gg@@ ish sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself to earn his living .
back then as today the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no service there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high response rates , but it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised establishments in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ pre@@ ten@@ tious willingness to live helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
having spent several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af was putting all its savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast snack .
A@@ shar@@ af &apos;s success story is now the subject of documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the companies operated by Afgh@@ ans , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant peace &amp; amp in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail and aim to return to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .
N@@ eti@@ zen report : bill dra@@ fts out of Egypt enable isolation of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail .
he reported on the ev@@ ac@@ uation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
share @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 shared on Twitter .
global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority .
users would have to register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of successful legislation on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to a penalty of up to six months or the end of a criminal record .
the law , which was applied by 60 members of parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a further member of the Euro MP filed a legislative proposal in which harder pun@@ ish@@ ments would be introduced for the President &apos;s offensive or high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law of the law , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who had led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison for a court appointment .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , including arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a released two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si lounge block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ ar@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ ro@@ gate Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist milit@@ ants
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours listening to Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated to a plan of action . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill to guarantee business people and during the former regime dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all the illeg@@ ally received money .
the document published on 21 April on Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website th@@ rows a light on how the presidential plans look to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined the nam@@ ing of his sources by giving an article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press decree , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new regulations of the Security Office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing news in social media .
in addition , in the regulations it is stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks is to be reached . it is up to now not clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only sel@@ ectively en@@ force these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat missed to register with the state government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the distribution of information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of information . the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and force them on request for the suspension of user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ ver@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ ed Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications said that the site was closed because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups to make a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance capabilities that would force Internet Service Provi@@ ders to monitor communications in real time and install malware , encryp@@ ting data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian population on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
