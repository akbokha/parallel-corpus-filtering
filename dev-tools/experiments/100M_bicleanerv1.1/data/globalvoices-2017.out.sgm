<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, dance to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who faced the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate with the help of Julia Roberts.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to Method Man," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his view he never stops behind the mountain, as it is said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people reacted to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was not able to reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles for life for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me as her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Ashley, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump took his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most of them are white, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (editor's note): as much as "white against all other ethnicities," the white and whiplash word match, which means so much like trauma trauma, as the big van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white American of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "could anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and vocal" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is Trumps Land now, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca have in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places not only changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, the La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding her musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 pupils has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughingly and with glittering eyes and play in the hustle and bustle and play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recycled instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have started turning parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all produced from rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage The children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an orchestra consisting of instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "the" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "follows the orchestra with its inspiring drama of trash-to-music around the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats illegal illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens within the scope of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to baptise one of their harbours and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, because of looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries alongside Somalia and Madagascar, who had driven the prime minister out of their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries like mind and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also circulated by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are done in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations can show if the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm campaigning for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover, which the eight members of the HISH-i network each year lose due to illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, quoting of fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a completely organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You may not run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and exactly this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front function.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international crime control agency, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps to track down the illegal ships that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to conceal their activities and their position." "" "and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminally acting vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization: a platform that provides satellite data and allows the position of every single tracking ship worldwide to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing - this simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "the Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detrimental but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously unlicensed and hardly expected to predict consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now seen a 33% increase in fishery sales since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia to detect Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are an object of study." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear annually through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries have joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now combating illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "". "" "" "with certainty, the aim is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia could report its first big triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag. and not only was the ship on the move without a license and were used tow nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method to protect the oceans really works across the world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's office.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government had rejected the opposition's request for a referendum in office, Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis, responded by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the refund of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central North of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation in the country is continually worsening, which manifests itself in the everyday life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the re-election of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance for a fundamental change; in the end, however, the secrecy of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government's decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% at the end of the year) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum on ministerial activity was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance, Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica, or short MUD (such as: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called upon a twelve-hour strike on the following day as well as a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government seat, to continue to block the referendum on office.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among others as follows:</seg>

<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic has already made the round that forms the scale of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office, which was now shown in the eyes of many people on the street.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, who was published on 23 August 2016 in DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult, Quijano has now spoken against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigated crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not yet realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Make sure they don't kidnap you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, the Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Argentinian revolutionary workers "party.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later, he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me that I would be a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to get out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little packet wrapped up in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lumps of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in it and saw a couch tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="350">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult for elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation has been removed first. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible motorists") was later replaced by the appropriate, if grammatically not completely correct designation "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture apologized for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt offended by inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is a reason to worry." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to have an active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally speaking, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, who could produce translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively low number of native English speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbalized and puzzling sentences that arise by mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints, which often adorn T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. however, by major companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more accurate translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surf) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they would not have access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionist groups, who resisted the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests commenced at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and delegated the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the link was apprehended and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that internet sites of Venezuelan providers are locked again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially during periods of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting protests since 2014. at that time the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission looked at this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VESfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible through a blockage of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Media and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds correctly or denies the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked canal, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also been informed that the government regulates internet connections: this makes the Venezuelan audience more difficult to access multimedia reporting about current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she could not eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as a criadita for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Crimean tas.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money handed over their minor son or their minor daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children must pay for this countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean tas, especially young girls affected by the Criadazgo practice - collected witnesses, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated to the Crimean is generally not to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family that their daughter in the belief that they conclude their education, improve their position in society, and "make something out of themselves" can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who takes up the girl and justifies their exploitation by faith, is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>

<seg id="438">She was in charge of the household of the former military hospital TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a clerk at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n was living with them in their home in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira hit MarÃ­n as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the practice of Criadazgo, rooted in the Paraguayan society, for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they marked the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest rallies and demanded that there would be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for rapid investigation of the fall.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Crimean.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the bigger family of the Leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). all in all, there are between 800 and 1.000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they always find less loot.</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the North East of Japan, documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was one of Japan's prefecture, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami resulting from it.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbors Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even so, Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years afterwards to rebuild local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese recovery authority as well as the survey results of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (for the most part), were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed here.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behel Accommodation (to the fore), one still endeavours to relocate to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in this case. more than 75 percent of evacuated people, who were hauled after the disaster in shelters, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools that were affected by misfortunes opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishery ports in Iwaate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishery ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of farmland in iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, for only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmlands belonging to Fukushima lie in the "nuclear lock zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima stays far away as well.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwaate are again 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants have felt more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how their feelings had changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of the respondents find that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63,000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40,000 residents of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated, who are still living in Behel Accommodation, are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The local community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, which is located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute every day to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who is open every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive time, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls exactly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the municipality saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar should remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years the shutdown of 98 sugarcane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>

<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations young people use hip-hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Welcome to a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo taken with the permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada focus on topics that are important to them. they do it with Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, since 2014 workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop honours the young participants in discussions on topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the State of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of Tears, a street section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although teenagers do not always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapskoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and go ahead of our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, close to the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru (which is the subject of the "metic models of the dishes") are presented by any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic meals and decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a variety of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning them today into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin purpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone bands decorated with plastic ribbons as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerators for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone-stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell phone stands and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon-roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing cheats?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic bags can also take on a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>

<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprenda Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking"), which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass newspaper kiosks every day and see the titles with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by the fact that they were" "" "watered up" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they don't move and are still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of extortion in the capital district: how a family with threats has been plundered." it describes how armed criminals pressed money off their business month by month, until they had torn down not only the business, but also demolished their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain on it never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>

<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because they don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself if tears would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez was missing.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office counted 3103 murders.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live on the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprensa Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong combination of image and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker traversed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses told drastically about atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left to count corpses," "" "said a Resident on Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be visualized on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unresolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from DR Congo appeared again when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented regulations for Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments like this example falsely linked the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash report published by the United Nations, those who could flee could be punches, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts were like the following, bringing together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture originates from an Saudi-Arab news page that mistakenly claimed President Burma's Thein Sein, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to scrutinize this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence associated with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important. therefore it is worth investigating how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers cannot believe in these images any longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are dozens of people who unintentionally share water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and diminishes the actual horror of what happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images from a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images will desensitise readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologues are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used in the context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Each investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudades) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists handle Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example, words from the Tap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- take care of your parents in recognition of how you care about yourself in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed up in the sun on cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They deceive other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood disaster and landslides in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which normally ends at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya moved over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">According to an opinion of the disaster relief centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and barely hundred people are missing because of the floods and mud waves.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and approximately 100,000 people have been placed at 304 safe places of residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rain falls on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Floods in Tawalama city with water levels of up to 7.5 metres. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="979">Sri Lanka's deadly floods exacerbate the crisis of the Dengue crisis, warns the Children after further rainfalls are already on their way.</seg>
<seg id="980">This morning the Neluwa Bus stopped in the high water, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moroda near Galle also flooded because of the water pegels of Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and other five are ready to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and start-ups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages such as Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams need drones for their operations, please call 0774844639.</seg>
<seg id="985">For those who want to donate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -</seg>
<seg id="986">Today we are in the area around Keleniya and Himba.</seg>
<seg id="987">Please call the number 0777449729 or 0777843841, if animals need assistance in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi call app Pickme (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app, so that the Katastophenzentrum is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, PickMe introduced a "flood help" button that allowed users to call a vehicle for retrieval of assistance and donations. they were then sent free to the Sri Lankan Red Cross.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched a "SOS" key, which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people with floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring security and assistance to residents in need.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They are mitigating me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is designed so well in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who like me don't fit into it, are being mitigated.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head scarf in public buildings, and Saudi Arabian, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of "others."</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why don't I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and people through creating the "other" in the public presentation, was even scientist of Stanford, four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and unconscious the "other"; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake, while he already captured countries and "to other" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">"" "" "" "global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog." ""</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it often involves understanding," "" "these events instead" "" "listen to appreciate, feel, touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers set their story in their own language first and then translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their presentation make the audience feel the same.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the Fabel of the Hoses and the Baboon in the Shona language of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his parable, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad smile, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syriac-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture organized in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publisher of books completed within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that was published last year and is freely available here contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements can be set up for free knowledge and what are the true costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked alongside site to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">In this process, what have we given up from times to extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" had taken Basel on the basis of a command of the military tribunal drawn from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototype was more proactive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the sign of numerous civilizations and here, Greek-Roman architectural styles are merging with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began his work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak good English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosabuch that she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover by Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2011, more than 65,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International since 2011, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: convicted Director after release resigned on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique responded with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in the state machine where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants due to misappropriation of 54 million Metics (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council was ruled by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his resignation to the company, which took place on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to resume his old post as the firm was not subject to any disciplinary action.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary action against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent person, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">In a disgusting way!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozicans and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn't have any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morality to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it were an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºt prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Prel prison will not only remain in memory for the Mozkaners as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral portrayals was when he vigorously affirmed that "an ambitious human being is capable of everything, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpea or chips." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network received their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East India or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings which have the same letter order as' Calar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splinterbse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknuter Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way, if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the phrase ku la -" "" "healing" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hitt believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before releasing all the posts suspected of being racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the opposite words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, spread hate speech, get a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to extinguish his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook guideline, I made a post to tell my friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to post, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they discovered that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "the automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is to intensify violence in communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to control the proliferating hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at more in context rather than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The childrens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously approved a law to ban this practice, so that the age-related age is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the married couple, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities were held in practice, and in May 2016 there came to a large public scream. back then, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, as that, age does not possess the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children's Rights, the minors are defined as" "" "every person under 18 years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent, and at 18, it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married in 19 from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements eager to abolish laws of children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. without doubt they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point there came doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the childrens was decided - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which reposted Leslie-Ann Boiselle to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted by 35 votes in the House of Representatives and not a single vote against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After being approved by the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthralled because the laws of the childrens were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Lovell Francis, a member of the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk about the crux of the matter, but do you know what? the toddler is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was thinking it was definitely long enough to get the practice off, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of the married couple has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for that - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The design for the change of the marriage network was decided today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "all deputies agreed have voted for the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The childrens are legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childlike shields.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought against him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the general secretary of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take legal action, the law should be passed, and he seems to release his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion as general, in a way that can only cause panic and displeasure, if we, instead of speaking of the problem, would say that the state that protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are facing them, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to judicial proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children's marriage is legal or the norm in different levels, even though there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1384">On the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption, which coincide with Russia's Day - the Russian National Day, the prosecutor's website was hacked by Yaroslavl district. the hackers left a witty message "Stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"" "or we bring you to the jail instead of Dimon." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-versed Internet users are used to use circumnavigation tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (Nr. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform cleared all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is still available in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (about the blockage of Wikipedia), we were able to put snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a MirrorPage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrorsites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices, as well as staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You are accessing a different URL that is not the original. that which you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to take a camera and try to straighten up the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring the animal world to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called to Navarra (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was found and I immediately started to kindle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood up to face with Tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to make recordings of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could shoot a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with great care avoid speaking the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to the social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a false tribunal and rejected his family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is common among men. however, they have far fewer allowances to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the breakdown of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children's marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS-infected persons, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in its discussion was women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Saying that the names of their husbands don't speak loudly, is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not withhold this is considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "patriarchy" "" "before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she all asked," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," "" "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she secured only herself during the whole exercise; another decided to let out the whole frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenalin to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as carrying the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I told my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "every discus club we make a trip." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never said so honestly about some things, for example, how our identities are attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say things loud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it's okay, but some wanted a Salone-Kurta to wear a wide shirt over a trousers; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of its own dress code, morality combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled its own couple of Kurtas (Obershirts) into a discussion round so that the women could carry it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The question of whether in the five months since her first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it for a couple of times, but then stopped to tell the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th this year the hashtag was a part of the feast for the Beatles memorial day in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the postwar period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, marked the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just barely five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," told Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retailer Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan is today. for the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Still today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese Karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles-memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">"" "the" "" "Beatles" "" "are the 5 places you absolutely need to visit." ""</seg>

<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages sometimes cannot be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles-memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Right now in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! embarked on a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year as well.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market technology, such as this ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald individuals for organ trafficking, probably for superstitious purposes, worries the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently used to make use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia was declaring the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of murder for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN launched a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government has developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Beware of bald men who travel to Mozambique are aimed at ritual attacks, the Mozambique police warned of the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hushed Algy Adamo, student and inhabitant of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said the local police were already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrummaa, Province of ZambÃ©zia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days three men with hair loss problems were killed in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the blogger poor Snaippa, who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE GERNE EIN Mozambique, THAT I am ashamed of having sex against good marks, work and other achievements, a nation in which people would be ashamed or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the albinos nor bald or bald men are hunted for superstitious purposes or "black magic."</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized due to liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state threat) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>

<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his award in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's advocate told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1672">Taiwan in Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>

<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was severely punished had led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noticed that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land, we hear that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who prefer to be democrats, leave the twisted logic because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam there were answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really no answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He answered such questions with non-answers in a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clear his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point insofar as it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the critics concerning the fact that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was more of a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "sei no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed by what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of Singapore's political leaders, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that really associates and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review breaks down the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam" "" "committed a mistake" "" "or was it a cheeky spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who needs to pay back our prime minister invoices?</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that decodes the junta, which in 2014 took power and, in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"" "the new song" "" "Dictator Girl" "" "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man telling what rules his girlfriend does." ""</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin Video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1805">It has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchassic war has been officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the Gulf of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Southeast Asia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked on Soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the majority of Russians and rabbits live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10.000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has been 16,000 people after a decade has barely risen.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez tells, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on cardboard outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them drugs that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Mercalli, who has a yoghurtbart) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel that it fits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil but it is for some Africans that are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Ms. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells her guests send her often text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chickens like Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family immigrated to their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 persons are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela states that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to press him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an apartment and an unknown person, a single person, offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travellers consult calmly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she flirts with numerous photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair ties she has made an Kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she briefly introduces it to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "you've already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the notification it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in announcing the police, the app would investigate and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, images, eBooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and remotely control your home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements about digital censorship in China focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme engravings and monitoring measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China," published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police inspecting the residents indiscriminately checked whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use equipment intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (like in Deutsch) also published a Jingwang product description indicating that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent review of Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at local police until 1 August.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of Urumqui's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside; sometimes he slumbs to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel accomplished his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as felahyees (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who is opposed to the conservative majority and questioned her old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and raptures.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues such as oritism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he hates a special aversion against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - he refers to himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he poured into water dissolved NescafÃ© into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a fervent hot junday has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slits talk of lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior ministry Jordaniens has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontssinger Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concerto.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "was cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which asks the old-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simply seismic, but in fact reflect a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender norms by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those who were supposed to trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in the past few years the number of" "" "honorary murders" "" "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a law to fight crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "" "be held in prison for an indefinite period of time" "", "and for their release it is often necessary for many years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the family's guarantee that the woman will not happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "politics has been worsened," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeatedly repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words," "" "get what you want" "" "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to later note that his comments were torn down, twisted and his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only a edited version was streamed," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nueva, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva, who later worked on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new any more that the government sanction attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service adopted several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, stating that they have critically commented on comments in social media concerning the problems associated with the corruption that is deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, reasoned and inner changes. he is sure that these changes will take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature on a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to tow and therefore resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the lorries, drums and dancing were passed over more than a thousand years ago, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the embassies, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a stunning way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outward appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep Peruvian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more regular citizens going into the hands of hairdressers who can recreate these costly hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts face each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks of how to watch in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of getting a training in the barber art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel flabby?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question left the young Colombian militants Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la-liaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Colombians, there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years and were exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their arms around the clock must now be integrated into the lives of civilians." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would close together and help with the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, which needed most urgent appeal.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support to former FARC combatants who now have their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the policy student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a sort of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran across the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him firmly and seated myself next to the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war too, was tired of being the faithful companion of this warrior all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some of the FARC leaders came together to a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC proclaimed the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice of the State affected the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this size it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing those people who have never found an ear and had no right to vote, and recognizing that the people whom I have often seen as a monster and even hated, are only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and done so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that after disarming peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take arms, stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, made a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents went through the WhatsApp round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing a few shopping bags from the rear seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you Schandstain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not thirty years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals are you placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there's my male name on it, but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They wanted to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, which has corrupted not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother got too much and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering with me, without any ID, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't think you're in security just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I filed a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who settled in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">They will most likely focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That is what I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"" "" "" "if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to judge Kadyrow's court." ""</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they attacked any village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so called Lord, this person was even present when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already familiar with Grozny before 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to approach the" "" "civilisation" "" "originally, but finally threw us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had stained eyelashes, wore tubes jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defence of Sharia has never hurt me even one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Spots not about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say it to children, when they make fun with the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long was this time of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had laughed and laughed at first looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still active as activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teetrews, gatherings, I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't make a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I parted breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is pure, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the" "" "Dagestaners" "" "have which, the Cabarines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they are - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims living in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transition to men who love men, and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different ways - two different kinds of feeling, in order to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is already last longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 remarked the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, Ahwazi's human rights groups who would like to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it quick to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on site warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have invaded this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and go on a safe work because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is developing only slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi Arabs work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Director of Iranian Director for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and graduated 45% from a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian family human rights activist based in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi people.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Because functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pros and surnames to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and thus be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">"" "" "" "in view of the circumstances that the Arab ancestors must endure, human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by Pixabay. published under CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even impose well-thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminist * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination on the grounds of gender is still across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I suffer twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists were to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to "uplift their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "in order to attain equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalized form of racist violence, which we are subjected to black women in twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic origin and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black women and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want that all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustice in her thinking, which refer to both the gender and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourn complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a terrible and marginalised being in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from the white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissolve myself completely from feminism and join the movement of the Womanism that has been summoned for my dark skin and status as a woman, rather than advocating a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever, that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: claims (such as Africa-Womanism: how we regain ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which constitute the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and marginalization after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life neither passed nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, are in general reported to the prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 blows and statistics 2 Invisible mistreatments and a legal system that do not subservient 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate conversion beatings and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really abused, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay" she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available figures are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 advertisements for domestic violence went to the District Attorney General. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. here too, 86% of women's ads came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on any woman refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do so," "" "she said at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counting at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she still had to repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together. but for two years she inherited psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to identify:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too subservient because they let themselves be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described her insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had insulted her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had enjoyed the so long of Carlos and did not leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least some innocence to it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mistreated them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "network (" "" "I believe you" "" ") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She conducted a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # Porellas (# Elector).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non Governments) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Femizid must explain and punish feminid as it is already the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the wording of the bill was changed in a number of ways in order to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalization of abortions that is currently banned in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill foreseen that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence presently have to bear, if they simply only reimburse an ad and wish to obtain a secure housing, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethinking must take place here, so that violence is no longer seen as normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the offenders get away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to refund so long that mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been amended, including a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes are taking place.</seg>

<seg id="2588">"" "" "" "medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area addressed to one of the most urgent needs of the continent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists helps build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed a serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>

<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment lies the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain a recipient, rather than being a leader.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>

<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: what is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>

<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, Big Data, Exploration of Space, Healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky initially appeared on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredaction, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortons's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Patents vary not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crinkled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or cartel varieties. as a result of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton is still breeding a salad, but he now takes longer, because his work is increasingly complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a boulder in a river to dwindle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand up in court, nobody can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the US and around the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salat of the" "" "greenhouse" "" "of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property so that plant breeders can be used permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can oblige that other seeds bred by them can freely use seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell them. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties and not immediately cut it out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark outlook and gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," the most recent examples include the merges of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which, for example, is offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to growing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all card features is protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only aggravated.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby assume that mass-grown plants such as wheat are still patented in a larger style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - such by which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders decreases through more and more patents. genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the altered conditions are much worse in terms of climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and vital for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property controls other breeders as" "" "promote patents and the protection of plant varietals." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers easier for farmers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and makes us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" "" "we don't really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation, requires massive herbicides, which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - they either reject patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>

<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is an open source seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an open source licence, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it is against the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend to patentate seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for open source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a world-wide alliance for open source seed systems that will be the official launch scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A combination of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report. it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, share it and improve seed policies to ensure stable food supply.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon recognize him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," "" "says Luby."

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains faithful to its aim to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. it has never been as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted in order to overcome the blockage and not to give up. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arabic-language issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of website closures has fallen victim to. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he was preparing to deal with the censorship of the Egyptian government was even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which Ziadas's blog is given, is on the other hand accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting about the student protests and recording a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles focus primarily on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada commented on the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although blocking the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege, a detention, a attempted murder, a charge at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities opened 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of providers that was possible through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, known as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">"" "" "" "such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users could have access to." ""</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally aggravated by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions in court." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in whole Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "a police officer in Rio de Janeiro" "" "killed 14-year-old," "" "Thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers from the army, navy and air tea to Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio, published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced a new column called" "" "war in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that deviates from civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the "War in Rio" section. (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">"" "" "" "extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war at all." ""</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argues against calling violence as a "war." this is, according to her opinion, a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold officers in charge of the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"" "" "" "this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - combined with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public services." ""</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember, the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Designating Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil" is wrong, according to CecÃ­lia: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are located in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015. these are the most up-to-date available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the Globo company, the largest media company in South America, which, as CecÃ­lia, has underlined the state's security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these security policy measures was the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up in 2003 by the state of Rio in order to conquer a Favela by deploying a massive police force and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. however, for several years the UPP has been increasingly under attack after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio is not compliant with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention on the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"" "" "" "in addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week later, the police cleared up the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime compared to loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">In particular, the Eastern Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the fact that the United Nations and other human rights organisations have committed massacres committed by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been besieged outside of Damascus, leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on food produced locally or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the many years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional crops planted in Syria and are very rarely part of Syrian cuisine. however, their food quality makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, told the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more" "" "gaining popularity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform Cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families of knowledge for planting mushrooms, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, the 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the shortage of fuel locally produced fuels from plastic are used to provide the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started the" "" "production of mushrooms from the regions" "" "before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in Eastern Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on October 21 in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 bursts that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, there was a similar tragedy in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured by the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos alone, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when residents were seeking information or trying to contact their relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the people with information: they took advantage of their own civil protection data using the fogos.pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: the site counted more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before a terrible civil war broke out between the various mujahedin groups that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't say it that way then she knew she wouldn't see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the party Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found herself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then as today the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "" "" "after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high response rates, but it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised establishments in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unpretentious willingness to live helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">Having spent several years working in the construction industry, Asharaf was putting all its savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf's success story is now the subject of documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the companies operated by Afghans, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant peace & amp in Padua; Spice and also behind the Kabulogna Pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs's goals reach far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail and aim to return to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans in this way.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen report: bill drafts out of Egypt enable isolation of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the evacuation of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Share @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of successful legislation on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to a penalty of up to six months or the end of a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by 60 members of parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "a further member of the Euro MP filed a legislative proposal in which harder punishments would be introduced for the President's offensive or high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law of the law, such action would be punished with prison and fines, legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who had led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty because of one, so many human rights groups agree, including arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza released two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of the pro-Morsi lounge block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishments of journalists Abdullah al-Fakarany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogate Tunisian activist militants</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours listening to Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated to a plan of action. according to the plan, the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill to guarantee business people and during the former regime dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all the illegally received money.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on Nawaat's website throws a light on how the presidential plans look to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia declined the naming of his sources by giving an article 11 of the Tunisian press decree, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Security Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In addition, in the regulations it is stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks is to be reached. it is up to now not clear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only selectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat missed to register with the state government as" "" "organizer of the distribution of information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of information. the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and force them on request for the suspension of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoverniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service Mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decreed Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blocking Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications said that the site was closed because it became" "" "an information source that cooperates with groups to make a political defamation campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">Following this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance capabilities that would force Internet Service Providers to monitor communications in real time and install malware, encrypting data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian population on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
