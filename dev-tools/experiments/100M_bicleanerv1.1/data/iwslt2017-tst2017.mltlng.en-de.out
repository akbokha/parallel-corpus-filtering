this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA heard illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapters at all ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has been investigating Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to First constitutional law , the media have the right to publish secret information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ a@@ geous they give . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they thought for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were abandoned .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , repor@@ ters and sources can always hide more and less .
instead of separating and conf@@ using cracks , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secretly app@@ reh@@ ensive about his telephone calls ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel noti@@ fications with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower in his attempt to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary convic@@ ted more than all the U.S. governments .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government down@@ gra@@ ded too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 almost every article about national security was the result of whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can do that from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitt@@ ance system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the here the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset .
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to ensure that not only technology providers such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who strikes the alarm for contaminated water by F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street In@@ sider , who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , &#91; the Panama Pap@@ ers revealed that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panam@@ anian law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has paid mail box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next un@@ veiled documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agency writer or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , like secret ha@@ v@@ ens of a few , will be used to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ ry@@ os@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who &apos;s behind these bi@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but due to the principle of these tax ha@@ v@@ ens , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 Bar Associ@@ ations in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US in order to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we were really shocked by the fact that all except one lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our hidden investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
this may sound very melanch@@ oly as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has been collecting in central registers at a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ ging behind it .
representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliament chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally stop the transparency that now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after completing my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at the to@@ e at the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers are actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate draws off and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and thus established &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on the wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends and pay our rent at the same time ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you close when you visit .
over the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a store that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you focus on the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Art , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your locked mobile phone to your left sitting person .
this soft start of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
this is how most of the guests feel when they stay overnight somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he was can@@ did@@ ly candidates for the office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 convic@@ tions , all saying : &quot; he can really grab very well @-@ un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to give your cell phone ?
because a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system boo@@ sts confidence decisi@@ vely .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest gave their testim@@ onial before we put them on line .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence .
it is little surprising that we trust human beings most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by convic@@ tions .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation p@@ ens out common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you cost from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great art@@ works in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered beforehand .
for us , the business is going very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was at the forefront when faith was broken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the overnight stays of the 123 million spent nights had a problem .
for people rightly trusted each other .
if trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can arise thereby .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring about books .
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay is running .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what we want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing come together with money transactions ?
it is a matter of economic commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a share of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when travelling nowadays , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place that one visits , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub craw@@ l neighborhood of which one has never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing their share ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun .
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a residence ,
were taught to people whose children were ex@@ tin@@ ct . incu@@ b@@ ator programs have been started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . today , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest with a stranger or a host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality has existed before .
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why exactly did ours work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most wouldn &apos;t know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ c@@ ass @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga is singing , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose the Hi@@ j@@ ab to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and it was true to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow dedication , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that anyone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that horri@@ ble morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock turned rapidly into rebellion .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mek@@ ka is bom@@ bed ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
not only did my country have been attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me into a suspi@@ cious one .
on the same day we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to go to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- when we ro@@ de - as deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims for the first time .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t m@@ um@@ ble . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or by people believed to be Muslims , distorted and struck .
there were really fire stops on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have ra@@ ped the anger of the people on terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are accus@@ ations that are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims .
when will we release them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US &apos;s body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US &apos;s body but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it will probably hold a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop terror .
regular attendance of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
as a first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or rejected by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x Cl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at them , they don &apos;t do what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and said her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que she shel@@ tered from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects both me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that when people submit news reports that were adver@@ sely reported to Muslims , they were more likely to receive military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as to circumc@@ ise the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you &apos;re looking when the mood sw@@ ells against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when it comes to as@@ signing collective debt , it is not just about decl@@ aring itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented at the dental faculty , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he went to De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove quietly , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled off my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred the courage and compassion of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem like an exception to the rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billi@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air distribution penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flights , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of space .
you can also build independently accessible structures .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and in general react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know coll@@ ectively , where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be executed at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers it can ho@@ ver , and has therefore great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of tail @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind @-@ bu@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter which position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions that are at the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts that are gathering to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one thing works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the most mechanically easiest remote @-@ operated flight unit . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly solid , and can move in the space everywhere .
however , it does not have the elegant tail@@ pipe &apos;s elegant algorithm . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right after all is minimal , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in self @-@ suffici@@ ency , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the others counter clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller comes out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making a half @-@ plane in@@ capable .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic sho@@ als .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units offers a range of aesthetic expression .
we took a standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ ps them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe aircraft on Broadway would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very distant gal@@ axy , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other more quickly , so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second turned into pure energy .
for this brief moment they lighted up bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ cell life on earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to look for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them kept them crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy genius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be increased considerably , which improved the recognition output tremend@@ ously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was started for a last test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gravit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes ro@@ de through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the good@@ bye to my sick father .
basically it was the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves of black holes and her through observ@@ atories such as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a cra@@ cking in the fabric of space and time .
with the passing of the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other .
in courses regarding the theory of rel@@ ativity , teachers often lead a really al@@ ber@@ nal dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stressed at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite handy , because you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
when it comes to sounds , it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties , such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is breaking them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by watching changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same chir@@ p with an additional tone change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , embos@@ sed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der noise &#93; No one who knows what to hear , knows this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers .
AA : let us consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , orbit a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we &apos;ve heard it .
in this there is the abi@@ ding importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to the exploration of the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I &apos;d like to know why some water @-@ icy stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the nucle@@ us , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through as these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravity waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by his own tail light .
with the help of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in space that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o immediately found things that we hadn &apos;t expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the no@@ od@@ les for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists in being as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
would I start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of was my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected form . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the ver@@ ge . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I bo@@ thered to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , get to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in a grand style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program to the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode , every nine days four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that simultaneously are in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series run succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I created myself , and not just produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , $ 350 million , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work , so that you understand that I am not just walking around the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it is not for dre@@ aming in a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ en into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
it &apos;s like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
that &apos;s how to get a high tone , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it .
many people accept when I declare them the bu@@ zz@@ ing that I am writing about writing that the writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , I do it .
but the sums -- when I began to work and work and make , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz@@ ing , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you cannot asp@@ ire to size differently .
the feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things are happening at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I only this bu@@ zz@@ ing ?
and then the sum stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working ti@@ tan .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
the sum of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was out .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my bu@@ ck was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz@@ ing .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just couldn &apos;t have fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ail yourself , stupid author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz@@ ing when you know the bu@@ zz@@ ing when you stop the bu@@ zz@@ ing , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South @-@ State wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and second , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I miss it when I &apos;m a Titan Poker and my h@@ um ru@@ cks , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except to be careful .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl wants to release into &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door rises and an energy boost comes in .
and not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is coming back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium dioxide , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of shows and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz@@ ing again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not enough for me as to work .
the truth is painful ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this admission is painful , as what a person pre@@ fers to be as home ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we drove around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always reach my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ em of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones do not want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and talk to my teen@@ age daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes , more need not .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even at a bad mood !
15 minutes on the track !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my oasis , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ em , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the track , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working is not working without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that is my hum@@ ming now .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the sum of love .
the sum of labour is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s up to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who is playing in Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the land I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the sum , the other , the right tot@@ als : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling of life is spreading within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll get you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing capability .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical techniques .
they certainly have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; thereby one im@@ planted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circu@@ it@@ ry of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function has improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that the brain shr@@ inks and the cran@@ ial pressure increases with the skull @-@ brain trauma .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let the cells grow from a piece of tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
the proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings must be found to thri@@ ve them .
this was exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to do it .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ rum cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic sphere and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then color them to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we reim@@ proved them at the close of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ port these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury and reim@@ proved exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ proved .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we color in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets of a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills range in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recre@@ ated up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey that recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we reim@@ pl@@ ete the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since then , we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you look further into the future , how many years it will take until someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ entre study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable fact .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , democracy disappears with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my angry friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are becoming mi@@ gh@@ tier , our future glo@@ omy , and our great , new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that th@@ rows its long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debts ,
but few recognize its twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , who are too anxi@@ ous to invest there where it could be productive and bring income , with which you could bear the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the US , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , rails , equipment and so on and so on .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did except to infl@@ ate stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital are the twin peaks that do not balance themselves through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in a final loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , in fear , the prophecy of the rac@@ ist could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow ,
un@@ inten@@ sely the circumstances bring about that cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
that is my hatred with capitalism --
its extremely wast@@ eful art . all this un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and , in particular , finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Roman democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive aspect of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same voting direction in questions of the state bel@@ ong@@ ings .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that lights up brigh@@ tly , it is quickly burnt out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ law for rulers .
for liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by gradually under@@ mining the economy and em@@ power@@ ing it .
wondering why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not at a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today one can be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics is dissi@@ p@@ ated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that so sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals from which they feed , decim@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , ine@@ quality rises , the total economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; retains the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts are deeper , as it is -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a disease @-@ like hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used to put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or to indul@@ ge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it take to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all in@@ comes from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labor are completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who operate , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there where the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re @-@ united politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which they prefer privileged persons , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as well as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally confused .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you clearly stated what you think from the western point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say it as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
now to blame China for doing what the West has done in the 19th century sm@@ ells immense in hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive cast @-@ down line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity to lay on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate before ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has not made any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I thought that there was an honest interest on the money len@@ ders &apos; sites to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been conducting a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone vis @-@ à @-@ vis someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to suggest the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to what it appears to me , it will be equally det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we sincer@@ ely hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for visiting TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studio ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon is going to produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought sector .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this curve .
this curve is the judging distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating has received .
if your show is rated at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive when you &apos;ve looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he has more thoughts about the average population , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure he is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something so that Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he requires guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can look at them for free .
and if Amazon identifies things for free , is it true , right ?
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts one ski@@ ps or looks back again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and alpha house lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at about the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of hosting a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to figure out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data signed firms .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computers .
the minimum you can expect is good TV , right ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release occurs or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always producing the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data from the most experienced companies is also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis could predict failures of flu , the aw@@ ful way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data from experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data rapidly flows into decisions of life -- at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I too know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized genetics - an area where some very smart people in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably use a lot of data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medicine . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you will mainly do two things :
first , you dis@@ assemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and putting together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
for this , there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that is why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , which they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first of all competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just one tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for making decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No Question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will do it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still paying out , making decisions , being an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
