<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA heard illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapters at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been investigating Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First constitutional law, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they thought for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can always hide more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and confusing cracks, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly apprehensive about his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel notifications with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower, and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower in his attempt to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary convicted more than all the U.S. governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government downgraded too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article about national security was the result of whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do that from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmittance system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the here the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important for us to ensure that not only technology providers such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who strikes the alarm for contaminated water by Flint. or a Wall Street Insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, [the Panama Papers revealed that rich and powerful] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has paid mail box companies in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency writer or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, like secret havens of a few, will be used to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matryosschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who's behind these bids.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle of these tax havens, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator into the offices of 13 Bar Associations in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US in order to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We were really shocked by the fact that all except one lawyer made suggestions to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our hidden investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very melancholy as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has been collecting in central registers at a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lagging behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties introduced a bill in both parliament chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness, this is a moment of change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally stop the transparency that now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after completing my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I rock there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaked at the toe at the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers are actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate draws off and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and thus established "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on the wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends and pay our rent at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you close when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a store that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you focus on the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your locked mobile phone to your left sitting person.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft start of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most of the guests feel when they stay overnight somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he was candidly candidates for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 convictions, all saying: "he can really grab very well-unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to give your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought-out feedback system boosts confidence decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest gave their testimonial before we put them on line.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">It is little surprising that we trust human beings most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by convictions.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation pens out common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you cost from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is also not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "" "Great artworks in your apartment! I make holiday with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"" "" "" "I was at the forefront when faith was broken." ""</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the overnight stays of the 123 million spent nights had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people rightly trusted each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wondrous can arise thereby.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travellers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring about books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what we want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing come together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic commerce.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing will not do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a share of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When travelling nowadays, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place that one visits, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub crawl neighborhood of which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing their share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"" "" "" "I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships rather than loneliness and isolation." ""</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were extinct. incubator programs have been started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. today, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest with a stranger or a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did ours work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>

<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carcass-fitness fanatic,</seg>

<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I chose the Hijab to wear my head cover.</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour can only be observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US's body but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It will probably hold a few parking spaces, but don't stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular attendance of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">As a first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or rejected by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and said her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque she sheltered from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects both me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that when people submit news reports that were adversely reported to Muslims, they were more likely to receive military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as to circumcise the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you're looking when the mood swells against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one thing that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we drove quietly, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>

<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air distribution penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independently accessible structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turmoil and in general react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must know collectively, where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be executed at the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the Starrflüglers it can hover, and has therefore great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tail-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind-bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft doesn't matter which position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions that are at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of movable parts that are gathering to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one thing works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the most mechanically easiest remote-operated flight unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly solid, and can move in the space everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant tailpipe's elegant algorithm. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right after all is minimal, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in self-sufficiency, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others counter clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller comes out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making a half-plane incapable.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic shoals.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units offers a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took a standard micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equips them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe aircraft on Broadway would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes circled each other more quickly, so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second turned into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this brief moment they lighted up brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, there was just a multi-cell life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to look for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector ligo: the Laser Interferometer-gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be increased considerably, which improved the recognition output tremendously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was started for a last test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rode through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and her through observatories such as ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cracking in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">With the passing of the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In courses regarding the theory of relativity, teachers often lead a really albernal dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stressed at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves in the following way:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy, because you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">When it comes to sounds, it's different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties, such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now, Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob is breaking them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by watching changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same chirp with an additional tone change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, embossed in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] No one who knows what to hear, knows this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the abiding importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to the exploration of the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I'd like to know why some water-icy stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravity waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by his own tail light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in space that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo immediately found things that we hadn't expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the noodles for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists in being as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "Yes!" "", "before which I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of was my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected form. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kitten, I need milk for my beak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the verge. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I bothered to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things out, get to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode, every nine days four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that simultaneously are in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I created myself, and not just produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, $350 million, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work, so that you understand that I am not just walking around the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it is not for dreaming in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepen into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">That's how to get a high tone, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare them the buzzing that I am writing about writing that the writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, I do it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work and make, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzzing, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzzing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, then you cannot aspire to size differently.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not for failure, and I only know that I love the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things are happening at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzzing?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working titan.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sum of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buck was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan does not sleep, doesn't give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just couldn't have fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Hail yourself, stupid author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you love what you are doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzzing when you know the buzzing when you stop the buzzing, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "South-State waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says:" "" "mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to everything and second, she didn't call me" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one more" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"" "" "" "I miss it when I'm a Titan Poker and my hum rucks, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes." ""</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says:" "" "mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the sum, I can't do anything except to be careful.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl wants to release into "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door rises and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzzing is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the titanium dioxide, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of shows and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the buzzing again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not enough for me as to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is painful,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, as what a person prefers to be as home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We drove around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always reach my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totem of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones do not want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talk to my teenage daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's only 15 minutes, more need not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even at a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my oasis, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is important to feel the totem, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track, why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzzing, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the buzzing is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of labour is part of me, but just one part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's up to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who is playing in Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sum. the land I create, the marathon which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the buzz, the sum, the other, the right totals: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, consistent, naked and new feeling of life is spreading within me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this buzz, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things out, I'll get you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing capability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical techniques.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard of one of the most known, the "deep-brain stimulation." thereby one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuitry of neurons in such a way that the neurological function has improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that the brain shrinks and the cranial pressure increases with the skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let the cells grow from a piece of tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">The proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings must be found to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This was exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to do it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebrum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-linguistic sphere and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then color them to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimproved them at the close of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimport these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimport the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplantated the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury and reimproved exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimproved.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we color in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor skills range in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recreated up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we reimplete the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since then, we have found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, such as Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani:" "" "Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you look further into the future, how many years it will take until someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable fact.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "indeed, democracy disappears with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my angry friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are becoming mightier, our future gloomy, and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that throws its long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debts,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, who are too anxious to invest there where it could be productive and bring income, with which you could bear the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity desperately needs, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, rails, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money, until one compares it with the $5.1 trillion dollars, which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did except to inflate stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital are the twin peaks that do not balance themselves through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in a final loop, encourages the pessimism of investors, which, in fear, the prophecy of the racist could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintensely the circumstances bring about that cause Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely wasteful art. all this unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and, in particular, finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Roman democracy on account of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive aspect of the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they grant them the right to political co-determination with the same voting direction in questions of the state belongings.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights up brightly, it is quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a bylaw for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place by gradually undermining the economy and empowering it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why the politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today one can be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics is dissipated into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that so sustainably decimated the animals from which they feed, decimated that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it is harming itself by the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, inequality rises, the total economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to reunite politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts are deeper, as it is -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a disease-like hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie, similar to that in "matrix," or by something similar to society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used to put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or to indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it take to look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labor are completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who operate, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there where the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a re-united politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which they prefer privileged persons, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am totally confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you clearly stated what you think from the western point of view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say it as provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now to blame China for doing what the West has done in the 19th century smells immense in hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to the complacency and the permanent denial that a massive cast-down line went through the eurozone and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to lay on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was, by the way, the first proposal to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to denounce the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate before?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has not made any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought that there was an honest interest on the money lenders' sites to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been conducting a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, admitted:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone vis-à-vis someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">Because if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to suggest the way of a post-modern 1930, according to what it appears to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we sincerely hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for visiting TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studio,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technique, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon is going to produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the judging distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating has received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" Game of Thrones, "" "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows that are addictive when you've looked at a relay, your brain asks:" "" "where are more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He has more thoughts about the average population, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something so that Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He requires guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can look at them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon identifies things for free, is it true, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts one skips or looks back again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom via four Republican U.S. senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and alpha house lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At about the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix spectators, the reviews they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to figure out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom via four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data signed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum you can expect is good TV, right?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always producing the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data from the most experienced companies is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis could predict failures of flu, the awful way -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data from experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data rapidly flows into decisions of life -- at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I too know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics - an area where some very smart people inconceivably use a lot of data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you will mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you disassemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and putting together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this, there is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That is why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, which they wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these pieces together and make a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first of all competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just one tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for making decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No Question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will do it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still paying out, making decisions, being an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
