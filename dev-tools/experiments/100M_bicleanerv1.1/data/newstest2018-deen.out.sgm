<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gardeners cultivate the erstwhile cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that had to be exciting because the car sat on a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called judgments, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying authorities between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops concluded with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was registered 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, when Munich's district was established.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in appears a smaller-part map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered flutes from the so-called "primitive reception" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no more farmers today - but small gardeners of the plant "land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the composition sheet, in the area of the present district au-Haidhausen one reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the height "On the ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße people locked up people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based Irrenanstalt" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was managing the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, finished the ankle of the so-called" "" "Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from using force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the centrifugal force in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people now meet at the Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west is the football field of the TSV München Eastern, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages stood at Marienhof, where these days are the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn core track will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colours has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to come into force by August 28, 2017, is calling for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention while travelling through the state and to be noted here, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents are to be found throughout the country and can be noted here," "" "says the group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionately aim to minorities, the group declared that the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year under questionable circumstances after he had no more gasoline during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of Missouri's Office of the Attorney General, showing that black motorists in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be prepared to bring chewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 Hassan Break in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassan Breton report of the FBI, which classify the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws, forcing local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">The electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezvn Project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac made a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU town association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the legal graves of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens provided and accommodated in five apartments Feriengarten.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is the alternative marketable way for him for the milk of his cows," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengarten, only Regionales arrive.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also the chairman of the Fisherman's Basin, he called the" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably manage on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area is a lot of work, a lot of things have to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and used it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he does not lead a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and worry about how to continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The surface area is 40 hectares, which must not be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and farmers it doesn't work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß also stated:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The regional care line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg permits the state funding of electric fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the existence of a funding set drawn by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be enclosed must not be passable (slope of over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisherman's Dielectric Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, who would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The most secure sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans esteem these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals for drastic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boatowls and liberty-immitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its significance, and in particular the importance that was attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller acosta described, "I don't want to mention a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem that you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is materially right, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who set themselves to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early neoconservatives that the American flame goes into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch will not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch will not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">The Director of Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong contingent of the world championship cadres will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to captain.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, competing in her fifth world championships at the 400-m Hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"" "" "" "the midrange runner Muir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year." ""</seg>

<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved with medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on platforms.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block Critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take a long time until the papers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He was knocking at the critique, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and dropped the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union was therefore complaining about him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overpowering democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Mr Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too simple to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same issue, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's staff referred to as" "" "concentrated spam" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cloaks or to arrest and silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>

<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County decreed the First Amendment, according to the US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit to the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed a different, less brilliant number when announcing the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.</seg>
<seg id="425">Musk dreamed: of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 had already been withdrawn.</seg>

<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be assembled - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday 16th July at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made friends and supporter tumours to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilary chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer premier: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumour Hill, apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the right of patronage belonged, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the local picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the glorious settlement centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 have underpinned these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval village law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with it was the right to use a priest or propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greatest of the two were crushed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later it had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church-chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumour Hilarius cemetery served as the final resting place for the dead from hearing schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary Church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortunes, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius plant as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As a promoter, friends and promoters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilary Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>

<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim refrains" "" "has called upon District Council Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette, as at the time in Viersen a wind force concentration zone existed only at the border with Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">These zones are intended to prevent the landscape being "paramount."</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier by a change in the land use plan - but that had not approved the district government Düsseldorf because of a fault.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a NEW subsidiary, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it will dismantle further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job shedding, which Director General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and in the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: in two opposing voices, the municipal council of fluorn-winches resolves the establishment of a common room in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="750">Although the area is still owned by the church community, it will still take some time, but there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stemmed by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common room.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the municipal council are facing such a community space not just as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the seniors just living, but openly in the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="755">"" "for example, the word" "" "knitting café" "" "made the lap." ""</seg>
<seg id="756">The decision, which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, is determined by means of funding.</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is located in the refurbishment area.</seg>
<seg id="758">The establishment of a common room would be, so reported Tjades, eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="759">The resolution foresees to signal the investor that in this respect no billets should be thrown between the legs, the statement that both semitrailers - which are leaning against the surrounding environment - as well as pent roof - which would reduce the height of the trump and make the building more economical.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer means, be this addition.</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: it happens unanimously to the body.</seg>
<seg id="762">It's not that easy with the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "Daniela's call points to the many separate buildings with which one does not move forward so right now, they now rest in the community room from the window, she says," "" "I'm hard with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface one does not give a subsidy, but get a real equivalent in the case of doubt, is the counter-speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">Staigner's request to split the proposal accordingly, will find three proponents.</seg>
<seg id="768">Thus it remains with two opposing voices in the original programme that Stefan Haller sums up: "if we put the decision in this way, we make a giant step towards closing a giant gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, in the x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they used to go through puberty sooner or later.</seg>

<seg id="904">Works on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good in time, it's going great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the department of road construction and transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work began at the same time on all three sanitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach is now on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1.30 m wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a boundary mount, which is also used as an operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">At the southern part of the bridge, a bridge crane with a width of 2.20 metres is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special part is that these are finished parts, a patent of Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special finger-spitzing feeling has required laying cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable connected to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crustaceans first had to be caught off.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach city entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge refurbishments amounts to 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag, Alice Weidel, and the deputy chairperson Beatrix of Storch to keep their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour the AfD event takes place, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 21 o'clock.</seg>

<seg id="1036">In 2016 he retired and also laid down the title "Prinzregmahl."</seg>
<seg id="1037">Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death, said Lene Balleby, the leader of the Danish royal house.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be, be still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1039">But he did not intend to be buried in his French home, but in Denmark.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Fiscal Rules of Football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues from European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organization that supervises the European game has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove sometime that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the wealth of wealth of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may have a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but they have to counter with legitimate income sources enabling them to break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini for his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had accumulated enormous debts in their quest for success, were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin if banks or owners retracted their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare off excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat fee, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">"" "" "" "Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the loss of revenue for the next five years amounting to EUR 44.4 million can be stated in the annual financial statements." ""</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of sanctions in 2014 was hit by PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise ordinary 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catarist company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments could come to Neymar on payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"" "" "" "but PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar's World Cup ambassador is going to be ambassador and could easily find such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, told on Thursday people who were familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the contract.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot square has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to make use of 12,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends in order to let it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the tops and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is opposite, so that when you push the door, you glide very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "a real estate agent will enter a rudimentary form and carry out a calculation based on the size of the soil." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which will help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate empire Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and business assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp argument on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - von Paul described as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means Colin property has a value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in an Affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed meditations, the first hearing was held by the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul affirms, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions in an incompetent manner.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Wife De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claims that Mark has been paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>

<seg id="1388">The new Chief of Staff Trumps plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried it and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in mailings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame dump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps's Twitter habit controlled, according to six former campaign officers, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trumps tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep it away from him a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented the fact that Trump has sparked controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - fully occupied with this story - told in May about the preference of the advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with leaking leaks, and that he can figure out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone announced to the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Stabsefin Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldsmith added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company company ltd. on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 nights were lost per year at the time and also revenues from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at the time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt "Lord Mayor Julian Osswald" defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested people at the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>

<seg id="1486">The investigators focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">As a result, Mueller took a close look at more and more Trumps's private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the Sondererissuer Trump was put in the centre in person and asked the accusation whether the President might have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>

<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C Schelfest.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this archipelago, the balance of waxing and abortion was disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelven will fall apart, writes AWI researchers Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am talking a lot about the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelven is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow straight into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only slightly, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest horseshoe of Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also affirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C Schelven will grow again or go back over the long term and possibly collapses, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers did not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, however, in recent decades, however, many of the polar bears of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends to South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature was a contributory factor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has heated by about three degrees in the last 50 years and thus tames to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants a house tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU asks to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new positions in the administration prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very popular.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are 50 non-occupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "under the wish of the parties, the administration is to develop" "" "a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract future-oriented candidate shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you previously did not know.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is from a regular" "" "competition of the public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees leaving the service for disease or age reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1569">It is high time for action so that no more jobs are left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, president of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had a long time already in the circle of chalk for a lazy surprise when he publicly challenged the staffing of human resources and amazed the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow an exit from the communal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the county government should aim with the unions - perhaps even in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - a house tariff," "" "says Peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually foresees the public service tariff.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available when you switch to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy accentuates the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warn that they must not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis alert came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Returns' because their team effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on Ambrogio Cartosio's Italian prosecutor's allegations.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the rescue of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Returns', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that the crew takes dinghy migrants on board, which are delivered directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can drive off so that the ships can be re-used.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was allegedly carried out only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board, who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring" "" "essential" "" "changes or obstructions" "" "to their rescue actions." ""</seg>

<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, which meant that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>

<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal turned out to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Wine Harvest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Viewing points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always long ascents, rewarding for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the popular sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, there was a lookout spot at the lookout spot, connected by "flowered" Trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altimeters were announced.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the stadium racing at wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high garages included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">The first federal liaisons have also recognised this, which are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took part in the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1623">"real football must deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-sportsmen under contract, you could be present far more often on these markets than once a year to send the federal government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are focused on competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, lilies have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the 2022 season E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certain to get used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example, elevated heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Moreover, cognitive abilities, technical and tactical understanding and fast responsiveness are needed.</seg>

<seg id="1641">A study by Management Consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, turnover is expected to be 130 million.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">"" "the BMW chair said that" "" "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," "" "and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to prohibit or limit diesel vehicles." ""</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutralization of exhaust fumes ejected by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignoring the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies attempt to avoid the faults of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was at times one of the most publicized cartoon draftsmen, his characters are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The Argentinean even traces with 85 and works on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">His message: laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he offered himself as a draughtsman for congratulation cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figurines cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table, works every day almost ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush animals and watches still find its droll figures worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The protagonist in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos favoured animal in his drawings - that has an exchange-footer as a counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures in the 3D movie, which will be released in 2019 on the cinema screen.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.</seg>
<seg id="1793">The script is not written by him.</seg>
<seg id="1794">That is why he rather focuses on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is produced without word.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Lavender threatens Provence from climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions which are reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather, there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"" "said Eric Chaisse:" "" "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have underdeveloped minor, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened." ""</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist accentuates the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent mayhem in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and stomach feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under attack and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspiration for Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamera.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special public prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconspicuous and although the terrain is still traitectory.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we mistrust everybody." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot at him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The contactor drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, aisle members bought any copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined Riodoce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever she went.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trade in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the job that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead men... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was His love for routine be his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing paths" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who designated the governor himself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For this week, Riodoce played three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state spending that concentrated on the native city of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, carried out a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing National Revolutionary Party (PRI), which almost throughout the century ruled all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "we had known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few notes and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist at the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder throughout the country by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">That day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to raise international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa a day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of scoring journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">Since then she has asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who put the organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "last year, the media guard group" "" "Articulo 19" "" "assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.</seg>

<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>

<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, Riodoce's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to hum.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shooting stars with belt rivets and security forces near the Mazatlan swimsuit had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>

<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodose-dinosaurs, which lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievably well preservative condition has amazed scientists who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the herbivorous herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk as he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He hit something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the 2500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have discovered that this herbivorous, even though it is covered with armor and resembles a rotating tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to blend better in its surroundings and dodge its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure was hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, strongly armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the chalk time," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved gut, to find out what he had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank to the seabed on his back.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was as warm as Souflorida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodose carrier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved flaky skin, but also retained in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chalk." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's asleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge geodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug near Fort McMurray near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were approximately 18 feet long (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were rained by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the water cremation of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the house-branches always cover hollowed curb plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured panels that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole. "</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured at a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, around 5 o'clock between the junction boxes Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm nearly 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, crashed into one another.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first there were no information about the exact number of the injured.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was a light to moderate injury, said a police spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large number of lifeboats were at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which are from the viewpoint of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter combined with a local business owner who had lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after August 9th," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black congregations.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came into mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt detainees.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets?" "" "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife." ""</seg>

<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that in this work and in the humanization of black people there must be a certain vulnerability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, which after the killing of the black teenager by Martin in 2012 marked the film "Blacklist Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The Bit Gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct split the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the topic hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That's really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, and the rest of the shops also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands where 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - to the Beda square with the opportunity to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying in the farmers market almost a week for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the concubines always happy again.</seg>

<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's the shopping spot in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I don't think it's superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of that in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger firms, because the rent there are often unsustainable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">It's a shame that special transactions almost no longer exist, and that which is left of it will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the peasant market hall take place during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives.</seg>

<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to introduce a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces have to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year sentence after making diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfemale and dissident dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from 30 portraits, such as anyone with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butsleeves and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned blouse were too unequal, who in the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Canungo, who foresaw a future in which President Chelmsford would transform judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a little deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways in order to flames the rigid splits that he should actually remedy.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said" "" "things happen for a certain reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis was gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take along is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories so that's 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness in your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful, or worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promise anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She summoned people out of the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to address surveys, to offer special groups and demographical groups, to provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistle-blowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which leaders have low tuning results - so that you can drill why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Finance website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The client has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has recorded regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves ethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Rugby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has implemented Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media" "" "came to their right," "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors that have supported both start-ups." ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent earned $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want you to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that is part of their votes, and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent as well as Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company asks staff according to your feedback, it can have a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can raise disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "because if you do not follow people asking yourself," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported via Glint, "says Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not become even more crazy, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big thing right now.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots during the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and Co-Founder of FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we'll see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey announcing his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex puppets have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with consciously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adjust" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there is more disturbing since many robots have the "personages" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex puppets have evolved into robots with a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxxy Gold Robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the allusions to rape when one goes a step towards Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site compatible True Companion Roxxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxy?" "" "it's called on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Maidservant ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stoched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediary or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Huumps high performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney an epitome of common sense of human dignity</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump outlook of the trump era that political divisions that have polarized the U.S. voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all reputed to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poetess who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely peculiar to the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but I am aware that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the ignominious effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we talk of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "normalization" "", "we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his babies will no longer discharge us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario, in which trump republicans normalize the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousels of the New York parking department, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are cracked and the animals twisting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klicking music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, as here two-year-old, one 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40's and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowing of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was disappointing while I wearied the experience to extend my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of sleighs, according to a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet booth in his home in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Investigation Agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal may be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2536">The place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a City Engineer since 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still a lot of fun for him as he communicates in the press briefing.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is wonderful that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In this way, while respecting the regular periods of notice, there should be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administration community as the Lower Building Law Authority, the applicant has to provide appropriate conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would no longer be able to fill them, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the city and the city are important to him, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "says Wacker, and the creation of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city constructor emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the city constructor bears great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is a builder," "" "at the end everything runs over my table." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you would like to be buried by Roland Wacker, according to the city of Haslach, you should provide completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a bachelor's degree in the field of architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of construction and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2566">According to the police, the so far unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad gliding in the area of the Leoben Straße (B116) onto the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male offenders and are looking for them since the night hours.</seg>

<seg id="2575">Just under ten people were booked Friday morning, two of them concerned the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall, but they had delays.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger infections are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system applies to people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe that had not been accommodated separately.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbioms had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri spread in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerable cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but if the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerable cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanues can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2864">The side of La League enjoys her interest in Marco Verratti bereuen</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not lag behind Neymar's persecution after issuing an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous stamp, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After completion, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way outside, although a source near the Catalans board insists that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of the PSG president three years ago in front of this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"" "" "" "I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," "" "said Al-Khelaifi." ""</seg>

<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2880">Because a car met him on his lane, the driver had to dodge a VW Touran and toured the guard rail.</seg>
<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum went on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the B 215 coming from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the area of the outskirts of Stolzenau, a passenger car met him on his lane so that he had to turn right.</seg>
<seg id="2883">The Touran driver toured the guard rail.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The driver of the passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" "" "We are Church," "" "declared after publication to the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the 93-year-old brother of the Emerified Pope Benedict XVI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral-cats, it was measured with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and avoided in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation," said the author Lucetta Scarafia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is part of everyday life and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal" "", "writes Scarafia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go to the church and this is a devoured Fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a quite normal pedagogical instrument" "" "had been," "" "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards for the past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "totally unjustified, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorandum" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is there in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber ordered from the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s were subjected to high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "to sum up, it can be said that von Domkapellmeister lived in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims noticed that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, therefore, in many cases even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence against defences in the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became more palpable when a domain had no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best throw at it, experience it too late or have not taken first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as literally" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger described him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always was surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to hatching.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only pop up with chairs and threw the keyring on the ground, but also condemned slap-cowards and overly cheeked guys to the hair or ears, he himself has given up years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It must be said, however, that such educational methods were widely used in the time, the 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are certainly bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not with his acquaintance and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who never understood him are still busy at the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report it was reported a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put some involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have been entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of the affected people," "" "Everything was very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the investigation of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even familiarise themselves with parents and siblings, then surely not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen School students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely realizations and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... even for really absurd to assume that it is expected... to have opened up more intrusive or more clear or even more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "the report concludes with a clear result:" "" "it was not possible to confirm that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any co-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate their good name with these conflicting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the grammar school of the Domspatzen station, between sexual abuse and the excesses of violence and, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the cathedral-sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were arbitrarily harassed and portrayed, all of them at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, like most witnesses stress, the subject" "" "pre-school" "" "was taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium's gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at most, the reproach remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">Yet despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and from his predecessors at a school in which he was not responsible and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently give ear to the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this to" "" "that in the pre-school the test penalty will continue to be practiced" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he received urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as auditors were also banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, like everyone else knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "" "fall of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger to evaluate the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times and not for what was broken in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the then beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all awful and I'm happy that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means of disciplining and punishment, so to pull ear-hammers and to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden, he also kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger shown in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing also apply to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, meaning Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, as the domes only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all hide that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world class from the rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not make a big singer from the unruly boy and before each success, no matter which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamentalist, deep-believing and heartless people, from whom you can't imagine that he could only do something wrong with a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former domes today, 23 years after his emerization, keep in touch with him regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him so far that he once was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable respectful person to whom they still look up and glorify them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that you submit to him are educational methods that were at the time of the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just released relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the starting point would be, a 93-year-old man who earned himself great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps still Germany, nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen to finally leave it in peace.</seg>
