Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing actions in the Middle East .
the meeting also aims to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal signed by Obama around the Iran nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not agreed upon with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election in Israel that was im@@ min@@ ent at that time .
in an emergency , Professor has admitted to have shot his girlfriend .
in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told me that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the disa@@ strous distress at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting in the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his education .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal background .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty contains 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something with him was wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the doctorate , which Lamb had worked so hard , would have no guarantee for an automatic way to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in spr@@ ing@@ time in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and a lamb was 20 when they met together by shared friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar play several years ago .
he was the s@@ warm of women then .
all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse working online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play finished in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were sitting and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , initiated the first semester program and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mah@@ n@@ wache , while the University Choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace were singing .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb is now saying that Lamb had made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb at his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss indeed described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plan to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that there won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to set up 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were employed .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with interviews and the number of employees will increase from October to December .
while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas season approaches , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to furnis@@ h stores with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I realise that the seat next to me is empty , and I gradually realise that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it seems to me that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an arro@@ whe@@ ad from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the meeting of the Council of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in cop@@ ing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a breakdown .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was delivered to the ascending track , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity ratings have turned by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six of ten Republi@@ cans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they are &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ ul has the right tem@@ per for a President such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is true in the nation &apos;s first preliminary state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six out of 10 In@@ depend@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their atro@@ cities , Republi@@ can voters keep pumping for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey from last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time that four of ten end July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is evident that a variety of GO@@ P constitu@@ ents Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating every one .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while anti @-@ pump support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvested the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly committed their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
yet Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic mode of withdrawal from Tr@@ ump will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage new orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey on Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans tell them that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it appears to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l from ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the amateur trails is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
in the street , one square meter of a roof @-@ roof house will cost around 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price is just like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros not - per square meter , well @-@ recorded .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : as an exception , Munich is not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a barrel .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a supreme pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e launched a dream start in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Pir@@ äus in the Hex@@ enk@@ dron of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack@@ ers ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ous hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally come to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received his 28 matches at the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , with the help of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who caused a shot of the World Master to pass as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based words . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud to stum@@ ble in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously with their offensive efforts , but often too un@@ le@@ ashed to work .
the attacks were often in@@ ferred on counter@@ clock@@ wise Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i &apos;s former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more lucky from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper part of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms Ide@@ a Brown struck the Polish head ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by a direct table , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians took up their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle pen@@ cils .
on Tor@@ door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was deser@@ ted .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ ch ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola let Guardi@@ ola defend a chain of four with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training session , said sports manager Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even with the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the defeated Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later .
in front of the game there was a crash in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans in their b@@ yst@@ anders apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the Munich parti@@ sans .
at least a Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , do not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : with ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had watched more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
smoking and loss of teeth therefore return to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained the author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to the old age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth@@ lessness , divided the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study rein@@ forces the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come across lef@@ to@@ vers from the late anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhine bank
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings , said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called soil mem@@ orials since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department of archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found a place .
from text documents it had already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church had stood , Trier explained .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
the Federal Police asks the people for help after a young woman is left at the train station .
on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway line towards the station building at the end of the platform , and was captured by a freight train that came from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .

European Commission hits a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
to mi@@ tig@@ ate the dispute about the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration equipment for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to clearly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the launch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de plans to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedures fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new Federal Court of Investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time , a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ ers , but there was no obj@@ ection to their sentences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment tri@@ bunal according to their own data .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , which are mainly required by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , the companies can bid for damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws , or en@@ force reductions in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act identified the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German secretary of economic affairs , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step forward .
the Commission took into account the reform essential points that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government too welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
this meant that particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it was still unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is deemed to be no longer durable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart depicting the shy folk singer Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , what his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs tell .
where they came up and how it looks , in his homeland .
St@@ ev@@ ens has since proven to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 release and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan , the Great Lake State &quot; cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously closely to American folk of the late 60s , but can drift into opul@@ ent opul@@ ence at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be con@@ stru@@ ed as a result . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live , guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a comprehensive masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
domin@@ ating ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no yearly list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sub@@ stitutes .
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , yet supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
he mainly presents the Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell , available since March .
even though nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without judging the audience , the band plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you can hear from the audience that the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the record . &quot;
only after an en@@ core St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bles himself , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bows to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s trial
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister &apos;s question since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s trial and for the first time put on David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , with his performance being audi@@ ted by the media and Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a shadow cabinet member and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour Chairman &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked a cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several front @-@ page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two @-@ night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of Shadow Mini@@ stries have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also follow within the Labour &quot; foot@@ steps , &quot; after Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour introduced changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s quest is too con@@ front and that he is subject to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perc@@ ei@@ ght@@ edness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ fe with re@@ actors and instead committed to concentr@@ ating on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle is represented by the Shadow Economic Council when he doesn &apos;t take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; often linked to the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the interview with the Prime Minister became the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his fellow parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply according to data , which indicates a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most successful estim@@ ation since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound climbed by more than 1 % compared with the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
Gl@@ en@@ core stock rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a drop of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s sold his assessment of the company rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports grew by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will balance the higher labor cost of his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 years old , a hanging with the Upper East crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
currently Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 rot@@ ates through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you are living I@@ dol , whose posters hang on in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in since Monday evening .
the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much on the day as her mother E@@ wa deserves half a year .
if ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the Gymnasium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fill it with a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory education ?
who che@@ ers it ?
the fans do not .
even Bie@@ ber himself is not .
he has already taken care of .
for the promotional period in the super market , he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company deposited many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he and about the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the window @-@ window .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber is ultimately in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to the idea of a potato d@@ öner view
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ach owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y Pot@@ ato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had seen on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer has been spinning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the Lebanese Association has now submitted the idea to the patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with his customers .
met@@ a starts soil resistance campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di boost in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ a has launched a soil stability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA stream@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ ers and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell che@@ ap@@ ly tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual investment strategy day .
there is a lot on the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA traders have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will grab around five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all available players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA stream@@ ers could lose 360 $ million sales per year and by cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens up 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on a high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath stated .
at the same time Met@@ alli@@ c loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s sales and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , talked about a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Mr Dou@@ glass has contacted Mr. Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ Gas Market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s food and food trade , which provides about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retail outlets , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction with simultaneous print on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , with@@ ers and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal sales prices with col@@ es and vo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retail outlets in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s main business leader , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and load @-@ recovery programmes are going to grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit again for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is rather deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ p viol@@ ated a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite excited about is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s trained hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the Kyr@@ gy@@ z decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all of the disputes around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has quickly made the ascent to which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to escape illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants trapped in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence hid for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels to agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged the European Union special summit to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however Hungary did not put its hopes on a prompt action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation triggered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is planning to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the entry point to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the incoming commercial refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass immigration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from the Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people attempting to cross the border , fifteen others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes committed under the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos envel@@ op@@ ed the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process man &apos;s data and press a crowd to push for it .
about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton remains a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ in@@ ating on a national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in primary elections ( 58 per cent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the Democratic constitu@@ ents of prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton holds a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have decreased .
their support among men has dropped mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has dissi@@ p@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over senior voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a five @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of prim@@ aries across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are above all enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those that Clinton currently does not support - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the Democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons Sup@@ por@@ ters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman &apos;s president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and voters will also be quoted .
as the vice @-@ president acc@@ uses a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the Democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked to vote for the party their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to se@@ gue for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; selectable &quot; is increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions on voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these constitu@@ ents of prim@@ aries stands out unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters in prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister continue to be questioned , most Democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their views in all .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on their overall views of Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion was wor@@ sen@@ ing .
they are mostly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters are not responsible for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the constitu@@ encies throughout the country see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks in the lead .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic constitu@@ ents in the preliminary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to a nationwide survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , the two candidates do not lose half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l , and others will lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted ahead of Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and that tr@@ ump is sur@@ passed among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked off with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the lowest level , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are located at 6 % on the third place .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey was Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is growing in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son ascending in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are measured only in the distance , for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient to find still warm water .
a bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer enter the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
swimming @-@ temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a mon@@ strous ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder attacks are filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood were brut@@ ally attacked by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a ritual ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and was repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly attached to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe suggested a charge of murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia attacks and forming a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold this accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest comes , and the domestic economy will be shaken , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only little instruction on how to proceed .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
that is why representatives of the US Central Bank have v@@ ehem@@ ently stressed that investors should not concentrate when it begins to increase interest rates but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could see that the whole excitement was potentially over@@ stated because of an interest rise .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends as to how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can be volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be accounted for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is happening after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is usually rising - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , quite flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the development cycle and the return on it begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that previously did not exist and could ha@@ sten a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants were posted all year round on the interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading will only have a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all development cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists quickly put in shadow after the beginning of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds tend to be faster than shares when they change their strategic direction .
at bonds the yields seem to change as soon as the first rise / decrease takes place in the cycle .
at the end of the trial period , the newcom@@ ers immediately fell , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and result in a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher earnings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing has expanded and the volati@@ lity continues - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy .
companies that wind up the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet gained an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will most lose , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains from higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s Conserv@@ ative member critici@@ zed the channel because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dou@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up the programme The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading parliament member and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Conserv@@ ative Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you only im@@ itate what &apos;s already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and enligh@@ tenment to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controllers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er efforts must be made to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports came under fire to push commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins grab@@ bed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced &quot; in particular BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday could be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issue in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales publisher to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases using their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting itself , and we will possibly experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times saw the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites collap@@ sed .
experts believe Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 issues a little more than £ 1 was spent online .
for some products such as TVs and washing machines more than one third of the purchases are now being carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion labels in the inner cities .
Muslims who are buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial pris@@ ons in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia e@@ vic@@ ted the collapse partially of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the kill@@ ings that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route to clo@@ the their respect when the first of the dead stepped their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession went past the holy place , where only days before a building crane was over@@ thrown by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then onto the bed .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king suspended a sanctions on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 star@@ ters who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ ch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have let the arm of the crane be stopped when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Great Mo@@ lich@@ é , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ch , which later took place this month .
the bin Laden group did not publish statements on the collapse of the crane and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ que as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other pen@@ alties will receive half of this amount .

Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the chain of construction markets , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , who offer services at low prices , is now out@@ dated .
for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open up 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men and close 60 points of sale by B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten buying decisions are taken by women .
at the moment , men prevail among the employees .
she said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to move this more towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a matter of principle , half of our clients comprise women with 80 percent of their decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of the top companies listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deport@@ ation .
the def@@ end@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse of authority .
he was acqu@@ itted of this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused decided that between 2006 and 2011 the def@@ end@@ ants used funds from the association accounts which they could disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial mis@@ si@@ les .
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Council , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in order to off@@ end the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was incurred by the association .
the sports officials had only charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , out of debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread profession large audi@@ tors of the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insur@@ ances down as security with the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , you are not allowed to pay any debts .
furthermore , with appropriate financial success , the withdrawal of expenses for expenses has been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expenses damage was paid out years later , as from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
as a result , l@@ ump sum and not detail agreements appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings .
the accounts and austerity books shared the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
why the out@@ flows of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial statements , but important is only the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one function@@ ary , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the Club account .
that had been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account was based on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally thought that he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor represented in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer was defined as &quot; claims for damage . &quot;
why claim in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never suffered a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never covered a cent salary , he only charged o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets .
he added to the association 1,000 euros a month at di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documentation for the early years could not be presented to the def@@ end@@ ants .
these were no longer kept after an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second def@@ end@@ ant also covered the mil@@ eage .
in his statement , he explained in his statement that he had to leave the international market to the bench from his hom@@ etown to the bank of Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard posts further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years , the Compu@@ te will be able to cut further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
there is no end to the sub@@ stitution of the HP @-@ Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the amount of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client segment .
in order to save costs tot@@ aling EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the 5@@ 5.000 jobs , which have been ongoing for three years , have not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share listed 2.3 percent on the market .
the Corporation from California , Pal@@ o Alto , California , has now split up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society this year - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services , recently added the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to the change in the industry by spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late re@@ acted that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more businesses online .
a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs are envis@@ aged by Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would pose a major challenge : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that other states are flying combat strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , 24 per cent oppose the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad charged 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 per cent would be eligible for it .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the centre of the fair are connected cars as well as electro@@ mobility until the 27th of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility connects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can attend the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organizers of V@@ DA &apos;s Auto Union expect about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water@@ th@@ row@@ er against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
a police line had formed behind it and a water @-@ laun@@ cher was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set pep@@ per@@ mint .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now somewhat withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was removed from the zone .
children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out .
other refugees came together and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank meets on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half the last week of the opinion was that the F@@ ed will do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will be 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the null zone and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced on Thursday at 8 : 00 PM CE@@ T
death Ar@@ cher at the Delta State University failed to leave sorry
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it un@@ settled , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , Lec@@ turer for Ge@@ ography and Social Science Education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb sailed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had kind@@ led relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he won &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ eman caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University in spring 2015 .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had a few stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ time partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly strug@@ gl@@ ed with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this surely demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa puts the company around
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year with a better organisation .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot &apos;s union .
Lufthansa approaches its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap prices of Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment is to achieve a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no more management board for the passenger business in the future .
the cheapest airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive board team headed by Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
during the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the Stri@@ ke Stri@@ ke on this Thursday .
this was shared by the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , the cockpit wants to achieve stable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is clear that in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa sub@@ camps to the company &apos;s own cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this brought the left outside def@@ enders to cry and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double b@@ ump and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be laid tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantas@@ tically , and then that happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the dressing room .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ metre .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United ar@@ gues the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England def@@ enders had an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to harm an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg wre@@ ck when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury this is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball in a different direction , so that it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital after a cou@@ l@@ game by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ law published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , re@@ produces a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads .
as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an Un@@ named boy , like the local environment , list@@ ens , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , slu@@ gg@@ ish essence , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s Elec@@ toral Bureau .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , there is no repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity on test level , is an option for the attack .
message related to this : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that ti@@ cket@@ eers are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago the run of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further acquisitions for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even though he did not produce such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton won nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first put Jonathan despite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer that I get up with .
he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge space , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of beating Mo@@ een beside Cook , giving an extra spin bow@@ ler and receiving four qui@@ cks , appeared , and I didn &apos;t mind anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cra@@ p of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ eds immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari joins the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s an Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dee , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the one @-@ day one , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in the heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Go@@ ing out of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy goes into a sl@@ ur@@ id until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ planned ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper with every day even without the choice of genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently broke down on Tuesday for Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are deeply mired in various crises as the EU is now and not always on its own , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want are full . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes a UK @-@ looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it happened in the exc@@ essively long persist@@ ing like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may intentionally not plan helpful notes , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not support during the 1975 @-@ inspired referendum , which supported our 1973 entry with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who has made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ odd ban@@ anas &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ foreigners , most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened up a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cap on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me anymore - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it can last but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I am very friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most of the people outside U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blue @-@ dy@@ e tendency and the wild gra@@ dient of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ man can probably say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said , when the sc@@ outs in him fought not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow @-@ Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70@@ ies when his old father insist@@ ed on TV to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , still what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right not to give Cameron any free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep label support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of when I started on Monday , what was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public expected that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO had previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T on public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained how to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding it was supposed to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part in the Tob@@ acco leadership of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products damage &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are substantially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison to that , but that we continue to study long term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what is evidence and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
the clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should quit the East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should cease sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should be used only to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ ested tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be ordered or sent that would be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider medi@@ um@@ - or long @-@ term for a good idea , one should at least apply its production to programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this public television should be .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows give what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Don@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ hrs .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ j@@ unk programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion £ ro@@ y@@ alties , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that for £ 150 a year you get a great value here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday demanded that the BBC should check its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To inform , train and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production was now officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public television stations in Australia and Canada to &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful is shown on television , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are heard with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mo@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aphrag@@ m channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ azi@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depth brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ onic channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mo@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ azi@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic can have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus make it possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ azi@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and Lec@@ turer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries .
many artists deal with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade posters sal@@ utes commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works for non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising campaign for the weapons fair - through a Le@@ gen@@ elle of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic and si@@ ze@@ able good@@ will , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ei@@ sh ring with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair dates back to the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors p@@ ave fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , I as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have been anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into the residence halls ranges from slightly annoying to completely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to talk : people tell where you are coming , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ yr where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love or hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your lashes were burnt on fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people be .
people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and local meeting points , but they are also places where people attract attention and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not forget to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a sanctuary , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the peak of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat result in people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say they use themselves , even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more well as my room@@ mate , adding a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors if it would matter to them to make drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep another two hours before she let down her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be ab@@ ys@@ mal embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to them , get rid of them and then see them every day , and perhaps experience how to over@@ ride all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot fellow @-@ resident is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to persu@@ ade your submission a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not t@@ ack its holding on the ceiling more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single persons , ring@@ ing ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner @-@ house town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees don &apos;t need living room , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the Ger@@ ing @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here for a great part .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient housing space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a row house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of flats .
each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the construction regulations complicated their plans ?
guil@@ d : I applied my project correctly for construction purposes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some stum@@ bled upon problems after the installation , because they received an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to make room - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is un@@ loaded during the update or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may be stopped half@@ way and this could lead to an abor@@ tion of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a slogan against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup finished in the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion before the race in Singapore on this Sunday of defending champion and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and will also launch the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who held over 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen for the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation which pres@@ ided over Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent finding should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district office looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ Centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations one can also take part in courses there .
the Sozial@@ stiftung pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice from now on to questions such as nursing insurance or benefits of health care and nursing staff .
for years now , our ambul@@ ant nursing staff has established that often caring relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not too many services of the insur@@ ances will not be avail@@ ed , because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the City Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , it is possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis also complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both managers see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the demographic change .
this requires a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the lon@@ el@@ iness of old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gather@@ ings . &quot;
by doing so , the social foundation makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and as good as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus ried on Tuesday .

men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an people
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the youth and hit him with his f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a break in the nose and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends arrived and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim first .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator persecuted the group with a passenger car to their home and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car anymore , the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male figure .
with the help of a stick , one hit the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue item description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practical work breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ izi@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor , Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing happiness : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ izi@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ eber@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich stands to his successor in the next few months .
after an expansion phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , and until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the field appearance years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met , who currently completed their specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital and will also come into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stall and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was ready , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the clos@@ eness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mill@@ er .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees being his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the double @-@ fold family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a leading emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is committed to voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 Euros will be provided by the Müll@@ ers as part of a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice every quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , in the North German average , there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ izi@@ ausen .
if no successor is found , it would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk , inci@@ dentally also looks at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their f@@ arewell an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel says , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly after the long time already felt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also brought up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum claim can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept border @-@ free migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled course of action .
Croatia considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is how this Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the minister pointed out , Slov@@ ene does not want to seal its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill obligations , otherwise the system won &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the near fields of corn .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly a matter of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country is counting with around 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border of Serbia , which was around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary closed , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , it could actually be the predicted shift of the previous Balkan route from Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west distance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen Member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007 , the EU partners since then have consistently issued a good testimony concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still some 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the minister of the Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently be a very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still not yet cleared mine fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier gi@@ ants lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his boarding services .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to make a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts predicted $ 10.@@ 84 .
the lower outlook comes in spite of the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average , and will take effect on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for transporting shipments of heavy and large packages , which will be raised in November .
the company said that the result was nonetheless expected to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in the online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivers solid yields if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , twelve of the analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , bringing the sales in its unit Express shipment to stagn@@ ant .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher earnings because of higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher operating costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most awa@@ ited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is located lo@@ oming over them at the end of the adorned , two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other matters .
the Central Bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solid , recent turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to step up this volati@@ lity by raising interest on federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at Mak@@ ler@@ a Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average was 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ky , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in explaining the financial markets to avoid getting panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would so@@ o@@ the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence acquired .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world picked up at the end of last month , after China had utilized its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would throt@@ tle global growth .
this month the market has recovered slightly , with D@@ ow being almost 10 % lower than May .
for the F@@ ed representatives market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when it is to raise interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events hadn &apos;t occurred in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks , they would put on re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the world economy &apos;s health is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency office of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere reference to Ben S. Bern@@ anke at that time in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; their monetary expansion triggered con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Sha@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , a legitimate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest rises , quoted Dec@@ isions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner .
a year later the F@@ ed representatives cleared these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam P. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears a rise in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still enjoys teaching with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to inform women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for the solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ around Building on the Bern@@ ese sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent community session , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee had previously decided , inter alia , to submit an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; permission was given for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ central first and roof@@ ing roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which is supposed to be under ten degrees for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan with regard to the roof a@@ version does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ese Municipal Council usually goes restric@@ tively in the case of exemp@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and of S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from the school and broad@@ band promotion .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now presented to the Federal Council of the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the District GmbH of the Land@@ kreis district who confirmed the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es next Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans are to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees in the P@@ ei@@ s@@ sen@@ berg Hospital will continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who are not able to go to Sh@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Dental Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
the question of who should succeed him came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who declared himself willing to take over the leadership from 1 October and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in every case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner Station .
for the next two years fisher@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree that both houses lead , until next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , lod@@ ged a rum@@ our that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day @-@ space psychiat@@ ry are accommod@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not been given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called for the Berg@@ ischer HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) .
in Wuppertal , the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite , but there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .

hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police informed .
after a firing ceremony a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
it was unclear at first how exactly it could come to the accident .
the det@@ ective police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to killing the young people and throwing their cor@@ p@@ ses into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police informed on Wednesday .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is also considered to be a suspect , who in fact admitted the indication and carried out investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the evening after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee gave the authorities a police inter@@ ro@@ gation to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be introduced to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death .
the further investigation should take place on the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with incoming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study on behalf of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as an asylum seek@@ er in a first @-@ hour accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising numbers of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit , which becomes bigger from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study , compl@@ ains .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of accommodation in WG rooms .
young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the flu@@ kes on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has dropped again for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved on the property tax and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be suspended temporarily .
in addition , attractive tax @-@ related amor@@ tis@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance .
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well connected with cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available EUR 300 million were already available on Monday evening at 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia turn into a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no going through to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees are choosing the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing its journey through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about setting up a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Slovenian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been broken up to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L reports 500 people on the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also practically eliminating the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
most of the media reports have been reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t come across borders .
but the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance should quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , almost no more refugees arrive in Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 challenged people .
shortly before the gate on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prohi@@ bit the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; newly set up at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees standing there .
practically no one has a chance to receive asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers have been broken down and one of the records in the border area has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria will reach only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government officials .
in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for Germany to continue their journey .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
smaller groups of refugees met in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly adjusted the traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the refugee flow , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before we did the unexpected guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we just said we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded tension passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els in order to find it after the short notice that the railway traffic was dis@@ continued after Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was shut down in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn before the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably bound a two @-@ brid@@ ged race on Sunday - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent other tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp at the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has raised the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis district of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing chao@@ tic states in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too will have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has been invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for people who seek protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be an even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full to do with the provision of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen opening centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as the lodging of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 homes have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have assured him of creating neighbour@@ hoods for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will explain how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen das Wir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ORF project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing them as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that the trans@@ duc@@ ers must comply with a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , Konrad is based on his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further to the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear the costs of the republic , as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own search for districts has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since we are currently unable to accommodate those affected without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of an emergency , however , other locations should be tested for their suitability .
the governor &apos;s criticism of the breakdown of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , has vo@@ iced further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees to Germany won &apos;t be any more for now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that Austria again carries out checks at its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; D is included , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later also to acquire them .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the plant , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center from Linz AG for 60 years .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ utta incu@@ b@@ ated a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade in short : after all , she has now gained a new business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell , among other things , bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags made by the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wonder@@ ed if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the producers of Fur@@ la , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the great area of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has got her fashion interest in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I am interested the most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women get into rap@@ ture when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag re@@ stores every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for upright .
whether he alien@@ ates alien@@ ation , journalists acc@@ ru@@ e or reveals gaps in knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stir@@ s up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire originate .
the New Yorker with the gro@@ oming hair@@ do is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
K@@ all@@ stadt Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt type , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter filmed an am@@ using documentary about the village and its famous children , including Tr@@ ump and the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to the &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts there .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also in the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a major Moor@@ ish , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt around , was &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; - in High German : the investors , she says .
Tr@@ ump therefore comes from the village of investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the USA for gold dig@@ gers .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company was the first purchase of real estate in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not pick up tr@@ ump because he was previously def@@ rau@@ ded without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had explained to the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ mother was a born tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born @-@ Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks more dist@@ anced to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so crum@@ bling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension host@@ ess Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm insi@@ sts like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been as he had , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sunrise dominated the reviews despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the liber@@ als leadership but there has been no major shift in the Today Reviews .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this det@@ ri@@ ment of the resistance seemed to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as the sunrise yiel@@ ded an average 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , in comparison with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number fell short of last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap closed during the last few months .
in August , Today posted an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , sunrise with an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today &apos;s Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect this dawn more than the Parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ er@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle on New Zealand &apos;s coast with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half @-@ hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , showed an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately win at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have apparently un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparent who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows in the day before out of three two , you may have accidentally issued an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves in a ly@@ rical way why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the gam@@ bler who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house made it clear last week that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood had to choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after reloc@@ ating to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sulph@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bench when he lost a don@@ ko@@ h as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to an Pun@@ t @-@ return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the mill &apos;s rest , he encouraged them .
in his press conference Tom@@ sul@@ a also confirmed Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the fen@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ autumn break in big wall@@ ets before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .

ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as did during the Yugosla@@ v Wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not possible , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Cho@@ ices CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ fer free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ v@@ ans demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum law@@ suits : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the regional policy in big wall@@ ets should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year Kul@@ tus@@ minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the &quot; intermediate plus &quot; pilot study at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the upper secondary school of three to four years is being tested .
but that does not go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ans who want to . &quot; &quot; &quot;

many stock markets expect the markets to be replaced on this Friday until after the interest decision in the US and also for the big fall on the stock exchanges .
the discussion about the burdens arising from nuclear withdrawal has pushed the RW@@ E shares into a record low in the meantime and also left their mark on E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , executive district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
twenty polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known for being able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent alter@@ cations since 10 .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have agreed on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu this week , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the commerci@@ alization of the 4000 @-@ square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are still no specific offers .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4,000 square meters in direct vicinity to the Old Post Art Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commercial and residential .
waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
what investor issues is not clear yet .
accordingly , no contracts had yet been signed .
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner of the street , already a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for vacation rental at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure excursion
for months it had been negotiated behind closed doors , gri@@ eved , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday house on the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went to the offensive on the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten @-@ to @-@ twelve million euro project has been under discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea book and member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge block over@@ looked by all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that traffic should increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; all the bus loads must come to make this happen , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the well @-@ known area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans were still variable .

Google launches double @-@ funding campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google , Inc . ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , fle@@ eing with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is being faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year @-@ old civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new J@@ AM@@ A surgery study .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity treatments for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight relative to size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital reported data collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of obesity @-@ surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the patients suffered from diabetes totally and in part 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes completely dis@@ b@@ anded in only one percent and in some cases with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflect the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) compared to the ga@@ stron@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of more serious individuals in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was with obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is increasingly attrac@@ ting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ loved at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
so even in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tually , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which de@@ votes itself to ethical studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be set against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and real development , primarily through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never resolved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and found out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of taking of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ ses in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres report , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going out in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said some kids visi@@ bly drink dis@@ infection while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
YouTube videos show how young@@ sters drink dis@@ infection products only because of a cheap experience .
juven@@ iles have pur@@ ported to mix disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison control centre at the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the broad@@ ca@@ ster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is deemed to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection di@@ aries and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the s@@ worn plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and presented disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a collision at the cross @-@ span between Nordr@@ ing and on Her@@ mit , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been easily injured during a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old lor@@ ry driver drove towards the round@@ about in the direction of the industrial area and it was too late that two vehicles ahead of the round@@ about had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed this vehicle to a standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
damage to the vehicles involved resulted in a damage of around 10,000 euros , shares the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready to ride and had to be tow@@ ed .

Griff@@ i@@ ths playing talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of discre@@ pan@@ cies at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch soccer fans lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they do not show any highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian director s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead , followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel it exactly like that - but we need to go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really need really the support of Cel@@ tic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Defender &apos;s Red Card was later lifted - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no doubt about integrity , I have not commented on any performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK as a whole .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland decreased to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , with the exception of late legal intervention , I will watch a man be put to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may view exec@@ utions in the USA , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will see it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formed better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ford , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down to all the details here again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his acts after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese ple@@ aded him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters from a police officer attempting to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a domestic peac@@ eke@@ eping incident in pel@@ vis .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Championship foot@@ b@@ aller Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to finish the race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that Racing Victoria ste@@ wards tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ g sample at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behaviour and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it right now .
but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have developed with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting Cob@@ alt Project , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching added that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the beaten Mei@@ ster Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race therapy rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly put mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also the same on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you &apos;ve gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals because of claims to ring games
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring Games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in R@@ ingen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ king of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team encouraged him with confidence , because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about w@@ rest@@ ling when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real center of gravity and that has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny how this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs R@@ oo@@ ster scored a higher result than the Game Bron@@ co against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
serving beer with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ dress
a man who could possibly have a lifetime penalty due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and landed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the advoc@@ ate of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café it could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal act , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he gave his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport to report to the police daily and to stop at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
during a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in the direction of Basel before a permanent construction site .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident causes broke apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage amounting to 12@@ 2,000 Euro was incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child mol@@ estation .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of the five images , then analysed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web @-@ research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were performed by him , but said that it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the accused took computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to having received in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January of this year and did not appear before court at a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael closed the verdict by October to get background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a security deposit in this case , but was held in custody due to hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was added to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the sentence .
bad user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left people at smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ u@@ bs to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station once again made clear calls for more refugees .
some 700 people have arrived in the provincial capital by 8 : 00 alone , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , refugees reached the city on Tuesday in 17@@ 59 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : out@@ ward of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against pet@@ als in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart informed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic last days , is the powerful low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected to take place in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , it is still on Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with arches of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years the auto @-@ showers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact car is primarily on the move , which is currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of the new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Publi@@ cation stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive either .
Opel launches an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , among which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is the only five @-@ door Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will be mounted on new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a station wagon .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan manager wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully adapts itself to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not quite new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger presented themselves above all by hand at the front end : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was especially modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the revised Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the At@@ tor@@ ney General Te@@ gel who lived for months in a small cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected may even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his attorney &apos;s statements , was now on a free foot , was moved to a larger cell .
although his term of liability was due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land Berlin , he failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for a renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Jud@@ gment now has to clarify the amount of compensation for money .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they first spoke in April to a det@@ ain@@ ee because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , Karlsruhe acknowledged the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday that a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case had certi@@ fy a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated for three months between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
therefore prisoners are locked up again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Department , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of offspring , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating that &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany will give you the following overview .
according to different estimates between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used every year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
it is dramatically the lack of housing , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments fall out of the rental budget , and these especially cheap apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
far too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually would have to arise and for this the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers and the Federal Minister for Building Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investing in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ one , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to the recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as residence duty , which limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , also because of the lack of skilled labour , the perspective of refugees has per@@ ished , in order to enable refugees to gain access to the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of networks is the king &apos;s way to work integration in the view of th@@ ron@@ hardt .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ do@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , managing hand@@ outs is distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators to rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ olen from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk under@@ estimated that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception hitherto was Berlin , Interior Sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Studi@@ er@@ willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ dung do not receive any services according to the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law more if they start studying .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the legitimate persons .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this breakdown is reduced to 15 months .
but this funding gap needs to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , who cares professionally for the newcom@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , integration will be much more than a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the majority society will also have to change , and the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder series showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and interest groups of non @-@ white German have long demanded and what international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention will obli@@ ge Germany must become reality in the coming years , when the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to medi@@ cally provide the hitherto expected refugees , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , District President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ power and capacity , we can do that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requests to hand out health cards immediately to all the newcom@@ ers .
achievements could be bil@@ led later with the federal states .
in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to see so many people with the limited service catalog , which the asylum seek@@ er law prescri@@ bes .
otherwise , the doctors will above all make the language barriers possible .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more poor@@ ly informed about their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in hospitals , but also in medical practices , interpretation costs need to be taken over .
it would also have helped many refugees with more general medical centers in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children there are clearly more im@@ par@@ ted disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ enligh@@ tenment .
but with the partly other diseases , German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , the refugees might even be able to allevi@@ ate pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have been a highly developed educational system ; some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapist Chamber of Commerce ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee trav@@ eller arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death sc@@ ares .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , &quot; Mun@@ z declared .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can make an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , in the majority of cases , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks like rab@@ bits to dream in the arena on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ader and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current Man@@ e@@ gen@@ st@@ aging .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
so the gift to fan@@ atics lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Jun@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cocktail with a cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
won the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to take up loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger @-@ tip @-@ feeling and joint @-@ ness .
balance with the wheel on a ball ?
there is no problem for He Yuan .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , how little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , can be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment : take care of the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jumps , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in a enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always do our best and with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks forward to his ideas from 17 to 20 September every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe positions fake speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread over social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with calls .
last month they had borrow@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the State in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said repor@@ ters to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in the Parliament ends and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split up into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave to manufacture electrical equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this sector , based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace regarding this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had badly finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten your career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant sample .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has posted 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Ar@@ senal is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a decent time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb off the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will set up a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need to afford a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favorites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal gained the lesson from last season with the Champions League Cap@@ it@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the hope to lead the association to his first European Capital triumph with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked for ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fes@@ ch : com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 @-@ 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial achievement is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football @-@ watching in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often stop to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing it explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status about the telephone may help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest on this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting around alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fes@@ ch

di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ but@@ s as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion down , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally got their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a header in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only aim for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris @-@ Team in one of three changes , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over to Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why , when he passed to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which Cel@@ tic suggested in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed widely to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes appeared , with some short@@ com@@ ings and bad deals , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had left in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , that Di Maria transformed into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an was the sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had left Max@@ well &apos;s left flan@@ k .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into the game , and only an excellent nick of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before a substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been identified at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian stated : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : in 2008 PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner of cups , four times champion league winner , twice champion champion , twice champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he stood before the exit of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds made ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on ero@@ des diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she doesn &apos;t need it behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ scored the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the team mates Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want people to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nut that is beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
the producer of Dear White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her director , &quot; at the end , could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger on the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against color .
in February Prince Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leader of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which ended its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final .
the last task was climbing at a rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or killed more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , even though he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , it receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt as if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended to an eighth squ@@ ad@@ ron , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
they used to be one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb up within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild card slot .
for Detroit , al@@ beit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it happens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings 6 times and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ sh@@ es any game , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle himself on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the head@@ board well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ali@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better out of the bul@@ l@@ ring , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh race , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer , Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe into a double play .
it was the 27th consecutive year in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double play
after signing a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , the Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed ruler stro@@ ve S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit became a pr@@ el@@ ude to the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of a still not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three ranks in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month for his back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ hes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who created a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third player Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , and made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE as 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right position .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A. J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
ann@@ ot@@ ations : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August due to a shoulder @-@ break@@ age , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is kn@@ itted from the list of injuries to fight against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has been missing on the right hip since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be defeated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it should be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden issued on Tuesday evening .
it counted 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared in recent days for this eventu@@ ality .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse , according to the governing pres@@ idency of the government responsible for the initial recording .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he designed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective displacement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany had passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany also sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could pick up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their aim is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann filed a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers plan to take a new start for the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Angela Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister of the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would get this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a pencil @-@ eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly shared in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now handle a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be sealed off with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent the tu@@ g@@ boat from seeking ev@@ asive action across Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants in Turkey made their way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
there is a global ocean under the c@@ res@@ cent of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon d@@ ots easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this movement is only small , but still too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is called in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already known for a long time that it was necessary to give liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
in 2006 Cass@@ ini had already discovered ice @-@ volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers at that time closed .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not cleared .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a rob@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ability to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after his conc@@ ussion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ bin O@@ ko@@ tie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can return to the team training again next week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already on Thursday the Austrian national player should enter the running training .
O@@ ko@@ tie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h at the head .
but , contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious bl@@ ur .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - above all su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them are B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Most of all , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone doesn &apos;t tell you how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
of course they taste pure or sweet .
but a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hear@@ ty dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service UPS ensures up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas season in the USA .
the company already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , UPS was announced on Tuesday .
above all drivers are looked for .
last year , UPS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 aids .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have used precau@@ tions to be ready for the Christmas business last year .
in 2013 , late deliveries had made harsh criticism to the parcel services .
first fo@@ eh@@ ement tower , then distinctive cold front
the next night falls in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn wind , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and night on Thursday the F@@ öhn blows partially with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ le valleys .
after fo@@ eh@@ ement on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front that brings strong rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a drop of temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a vigor@@ ous southwest current .
on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night to Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up until Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with arches of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn winds its way up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even or@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the slope of the Alps .
this is where rain stops , which stops until Thursday evening .
in total , in the south of the Alps , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter have to be accounted for in the next 48 hours , this after heavy rainf@@ all has fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow @-@ dryer leaves the air , as a result , a cold front with strong , partially swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east via Switzerland rolls .
along with the cold front the wind pi@@ cks up strongly until stor@@ m@@ ically , and the temperatures are notic@@ e@@ ably dec@@ lining .
the following days are in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , while in the south it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of Prime Minister Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live only in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority .
with the Square , it is symbo@@ lically visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city as a rotten bill of sin .
his negative impressions , according to histori@@ ans , might have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the spl@@ itting of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his theses about aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gold @-@ plated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crown is one of the main works by Ot@@ mar Alt for his bi@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible , which has now been published with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated in 150 pictures his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all Books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles dedicated to topics such as cross paths , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ ours .
as a result , he spontaneously fascin@@ ates several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar aus and translated into current context into today &apos;s context .
these texts are like verbal mirror by Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Orden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education took place already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up that in order to bring me back to my father &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ focus on art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is marked by advertising today , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have another desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; slide into the images , &quot; let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost posted Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , even mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas patterns - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction start for BM@@ X railway approaches
plans made , place found , companies contracted , Erd@@ hü@@ gel model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was already finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration provided a foo@@ thold , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was received in October , the first municipal coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck can now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B strengthens commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its assistance in cop@@ ing with the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone , to get this topic under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would help .
but the crucial point must be policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; declared Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will help the &quot; Wir - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the otherwise usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen met Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can look away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use soccer broad@@ cast@@ ers , no , we need to use our power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent division of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places is great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the Association together with the DF@@ B and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
according to Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , head of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , re@@ port@@ edly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass at midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then he came out on the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go on his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully operational . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I spent all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP head office in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something can happen to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again when you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen in addition to fighting ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photograph and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he is therefore just as little as reserve @-@ keeper for the two Stam@@ b@@ il@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the football championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach announced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of home keeper Roman Br@@ yan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soccer coach praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left it open if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be deployed in all the Europa League games in the future .
with a high probability he will also play the second game .
the for@@ ceful statement by Mit@@ ter Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , keeps Mittel@@ feld@@ player Julian W@@ eig@@ l understandable : &quot; with it Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss this topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states coming together with industry representatives at the IAA .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid rise to digital radio communications .
in order to test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the 9 motorway in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks to be born , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in a matter of seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to some 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
the Germans are still scep@@ tical - a lot more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute &apos;s AA on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not reck@@ on at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those questioned by 20@@ 25 are reck@@ oned with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the United States .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give the control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the present stand , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf plans to hit only in sing@@ les at the title fight of September 25 - October 4 .
the final decision is to be made on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the coach trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European apprentices@@ hip in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European leader Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo added , and we became European leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the world rank fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven the defender was hit by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after long treatment .
the first diagnosis was pointed out by Bas@@ tian pig &apos;s 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow player .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figure cabinet : designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins which look horri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially rejected attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort has been carried out : to form the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot car@@ r@@ elled 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the October feast was a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought some of them , of course .
he couldn &apos;t pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewels instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as a fashion niche
in the past it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in great numbers for customers , which they worked on for example , for blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the gran@@ aries of P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a bigger role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing job potential .
those who have no niche in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
fashion j@@ okes P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they can carry the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialty shops and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the mass commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold over chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer speaks of the embroi@@ dery bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design will often only be slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
a couple of years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historical snow ball .
the machine sn@@ akes small spheres at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ dry gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße inspir@@ es himself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional lea@@ der@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring on a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic nur@@ sery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to expand out@@ wards to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i .
the Leadership Group has adopted a set of directives , including a negative list regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is drawn up which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , since it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double its mercury level in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the levels of mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to consume the consumer with a much higher dose of the neur@@ on .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sh@@ arks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
in turn , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ utt@@ le@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they are already keeping the planned high values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of plain @-@ fish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dent removal manoeu@@ vre which only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for human beings , which greatly enrich the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small quantities can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage to the nervous system especially in infants &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry stated on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants launched more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance , in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
