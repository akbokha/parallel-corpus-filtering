Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal raised by Obama around the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has continued to deterior@@ ate .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with regard to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor decides to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emer@@ gen@@ cies some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he was also a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer anymore .
after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ b lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that it believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in early spring education .
one of the long@@ standing friends of Lam@@ b described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when she met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica ended before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now said that Lamb had the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call was called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plan to hire less man@@ power for the Christmas season
the Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it planned to employ 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees rose from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox acqu@@ ires his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arro@@ gan@@ ce of it to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his answer to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; for almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader ur@@ ges all parties including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the General Meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 surveys that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks of poll@@ s down , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s staying power and start making their dollars flowing to overthrow him .
here are some recent surveys suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six out of 10 In@@ depend@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their scholars , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , four out of ten last week say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time that four out of ten end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters will see Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump sums up almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to dr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support .
he has scored 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly assigned their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration of turning and fishing was at the public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in matters of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to be doing it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new levels .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days @-@ survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington too .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of the four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , 54 per cent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; hell offen@@ ded . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea resort .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is limited naturally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top housing sites , however , one of the awards comes from the same price as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well marked .
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
dual scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third race .
at his 28th matches in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , Müller received good online help from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who suffered a shot of the World Champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ speaking word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , among them against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) was also proud of this .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by means of g@@ ame@@ play on the left @-@ hand side Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half of one .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown suggested the poles of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by director , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee was par@@ ed ( 35 . ) .
even though the Bav@@ arians had their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ fers .
but at Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was forgiveness .
for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before new he allowed Guardi@@ ola to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , it &apos;s vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
id@@ ol@@ aters arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still had one .
in front of the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block evi@@ dently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went on strike against the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ che .
the scientists had watched more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay causes tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ y inflamm@@ ations in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Er@@ dust @-@ author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; man should persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , said head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health up to the age of old according to our findings .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population is affected by the age of 65 to 74 years , the DI@@ f@@ E announced .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking reduces the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter rem@@ n@@ ants of late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ n@@ ants of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department for archaeological ground preservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found to be found .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to develop the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new Court of Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
a second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to raise obj@@ ection to jud@@ gements .
until now , the parties of the proceedings agreed with each other to arbit@@ ers , a claim against their judgments had not existed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it aims to work towards an international investment tri@@ bunal .
for instance , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied there .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , which allows companies to first ride out damages of tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel elabor@@ ated in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the action of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart that the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places , which he repeatedly records on the map , which reports about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ence at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the states should be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician lives back to the series in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ ff@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ ise &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece appeared in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not missing in any annual lea@@ der@@ board in the influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with every effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs rose , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ spur straps and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens returns as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the dark@@ ened ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without saying a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core is St@@ ev@@ ens modest , playing acousti@@ cally a few older songs and eventually dec@@ lines with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister Fra@@ ction
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister Fra@@ ction is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n aims to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ ction and to invest in David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre @-@ determined questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance by the media is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment to become a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the fall of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain is provoked by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several titles stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour , namely Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation with profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference , that Labour need to make changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has since been T@@ ory leader , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s questions are too con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from &quot; po@@ ign@@ ity &quot; and the strike with bar@@ gaining and instead has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the shadow of economic minister , if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the under@@ house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy theatre &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister Fra@@ ction . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television first in 1990 , the Fra@@ ction with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds rise through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose rup@@ tly according to data that indicate an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the target of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK rose by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and ear@@ marked assessment of the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound was climbed by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v had been received .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares climbed 5 % after the mining giant said that he was $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a drop by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports is saying that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .

the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros hard .
rather even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber Construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose posters hang up in St@@ et@@ tin since Monday evening .
the suite , in which the Canadian singer res@@ ides , costs exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory school light ?
who does it che@@ at ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even bending itself is not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertising in the advertising break of the super@@ man , he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ slip company flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and at each doll , which looks like he and about the counter @-@ table , Bie@@ ber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you will be amazed at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say that hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in place 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to potato twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
it is both in the Pot@@ ato twe@@ eter developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y Pot@@ ato and meat have put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop there is a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea has meanwhile registered the Lebanese by the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary understanding of international people is also good with its customers .
Met@@ aboli@@ sm starts fre@@ est@@ anding campaign to fight against Al@@ di@@ -
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ aboli@@ sm has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump aboard , with brands such as ice manufacturers S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in East Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two states after the opening of his first markets and to remove all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 million turnover per year and Met@@ cash from $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the high fixed cost base of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s revenues in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2017 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ a refused to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s food and food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operational debt reduction with simultaneous print on sales and margins .
wholes@@ al@@ ers , however , rep@@ els and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to offset sales prices with col@@ es and wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their shops by fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading san@@ itation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Stu@@ gios , and according to the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is often called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the not@@ orious examination of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp seduc@@ ed a potential US Open win of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty busy is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit drag@@ ged into the battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost US Open because of a struggle but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he has been treated too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also did not support the decision to take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be entirely focused on competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has made quick progress on what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stop , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency stand and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally come into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ul@@ ating in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acted by Serbian officials .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister explained that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c at a strict meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not set its hopes on a verbal action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to under@@ lined that his country also plane the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having stopped a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison residents were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , became a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire had arrived to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and press a crowd to get there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pres@@ election ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he was chann@@ eled for the Pres@@ idency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is certain which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned a number of wins .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and women , but these projections have decreased .
their support among the men is clearly s@@ unken , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit advance at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the demo@@ cra@@ cies of the elections say nationwide that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled by her .
the views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question are asked why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and vot@@ ability is also quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Vice President acc@@ uses a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the demo@@ cra@@ cies of the pres@@ election want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if democratic voters are asked for the election , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den was their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head start S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the ability to choose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this election is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important characteristics of the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters of the pres@@ election generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server will continue as foreign minister during the term of office , most democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , even though 36 percent said that their opinion was wor@@ sen@@ ed by it .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the entitled to vote nationwide also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes for leadership .
from the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut off best in hon@@ esty .
a majority se@@ eth S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is on the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is om@@ itted , and others lose a dramatic hold .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump in Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , has been defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell in the lowest rate of 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are located at 6 % in third place .
the error margin for the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in poll@@ s - it lands at 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side thi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers in order to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
in contrast , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , there are 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ anch@@ ors will be filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , distributed the police .
officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 @-@ pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the sh@@ kan@@ es of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a charge for the murder of the third County for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with slan@@ der@@ ous attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or officially - this will also lead us to accoun@@ t@@ ability , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest comes , and the hou@@ sec@@ ts will fall into bank@@ rupt@@ cy , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a interest rate increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a view on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be honoured 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases by the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then return to normal state after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that published Bob D@@ oll , head system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the raising cycle and the yield begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession .
particularly not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases were only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to pers@@ ist and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raises the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants took the whole year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all raising cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates interest rate and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stocks if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the raising cycle , the bank@@ rupt@@ cies immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high interest rates often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the income curve is flat , credit tension has expanded and the volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed exac@@ erb@@ ates its strategy .
in large and large corporations , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet exceed 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transmitter for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , maintains a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to face commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit out of our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time it starts a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order of further ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the commission pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales were slow@@ ing down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down issues in November
for over a decade virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the Guardian IM@@ R@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may possibly experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the wan@@ ing sales .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 has spent some more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of men bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the Cran@@ e accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially wre@@ aks the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health told that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mother .
mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to show their respect when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning procession passed on to the holy place , where only days before a building crane through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king talked about the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , imposed a sanc@@ tion .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ ck@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to go to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today king Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have left the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was prohibited overseas .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man tried to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which collap@@ sed into a courtyard of the great mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which was later held this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ad@@ dened the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) was to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount to permanently injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .

this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at arti@@ sans , will be opened .
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales points will close nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is alleged that the British put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because British employ increasingly craftsmen to do home @-@ job jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt @-@ Chain , said that a large increase in number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices is now out@@ dated .
as a result , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that address tra@@ des@@ people and close up to 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten buying decisions were made by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to move this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group inde@@ xed the cost of closing the shops .
because of its trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball championship leader A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dispens@@ ing .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ end@@ ants were used in the years 2006 to 2011 mon@@ ies of association accounts for which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is roughly 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also charged with financial difficulties .
this fact was due to the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the reproach of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence was that no asset was created at any time .
the sports officials had charged only expense and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread profession of the Financial Office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , only no debts can be made .
in the case of corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , flat and non @-@ detailed bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings .
the accounts and pass@@ books managed the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
why the withdrawal from the association was not disclosed in detail , asked the judge .
the association was not interested in the details of the financial sector , but it was important that it was only the freedom of debt , the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account .
those were the def@@ end@@ ants , decl@@ aring the def@@ end@@ ants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the public prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant was informed , justified himself by the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim compensation ? , wanted judge and prosec@@ utor to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to instruc@@ t accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all the deport@@ ations are in cash , and he said in his statement that he had to go to the bank of Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the bank .
the main hearing continues on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to personnel reductions , which have been running for three years , the Compu@@ Stra@@ ese will build more jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
there is no end to the sub@@ missions at the HP @-@ Compu@@ te Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs , which has been ongoing for three years , has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share declined by 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting into a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services was the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo most recently .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the proceeds returned to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late responded that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more businesses online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would predominantly lead to rejection : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 per cent expressed themselves .
that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 per cent are positive .
however , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents declined , 20 per cent would be for this .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the focus of the fair is on the 27th of September , connected cars , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility connects &quot; on Thursday .
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
as in the past two years , the organizers of the V@@ DA Verband Deutscher Verband ( V@@ DA ) reck@@ on with about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence of violence at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed on the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and wat@@ chers against several hundreds of abandoned refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it had a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen a wat@@ cher was ready .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first put an un@@ interrupted pep@@ per@@ mint spray .
after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
the group was thus dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drew a bit of restra@@ int .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees drow@@ ned in themselves and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and the interest rates will last at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest bet on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude prospect of global standards .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death cont@@ actor at the Delta State University left exc@@ uses
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleague on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted him to &quot; make it happen &quot; , authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot on someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers according to his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years than a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a PhD title from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , like his life law on the university &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor has also allegedly strug@@ gl@@ ed with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug traffi@@ cking .
all this certainly demands its toll .
Eu@@ rov@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa plans to build a large group of companies .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 managers worldwide will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap lighting of Eu@@ rov@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
there are , among other things , no more board member for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ rov@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ rov@@ ings in the executive team headed by CEO Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ rov@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operating under the umbrella of the Passage airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot @-@ association cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the court stopped .
this shared the union .
the subject of talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted record , cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to come to viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the pilot &apos;s concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is next to the pilot &apos;s transition supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa sees routes to the Group &apos;s own cheap airline Eu@@ rov@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this caused the left external def@@ enders to cry and won him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double penetration and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of a El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mo@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back stronger . &quot;
in this regard , Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the square with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ ting by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book it will not take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided that Dr. Se@@ uss was published in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything beautiful and good , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead re@@ prints a table of content of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ read @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was l@@ ur@@ king and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ read @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here &apos;s an Un@@ named boy , like the local environment due to the gre@@ edy , trees for@@ fei@@ ting , th@@ need stri@@ pping Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the name of the name of the name of the name of the trees &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circular bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England selected for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ tro@@ phy .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have length@@ ened the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out other races for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set up Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I put up high .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this of course depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four squ@@ ats , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a punch man cannot beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately aboli@@ shed and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he really impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in harmony with what is said before .
mate te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy by heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain an allowance if the economy is in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ lau@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ vent ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states , deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now , and not always from their own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes a Britain looking outside in the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we are staying or going .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as with the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they are pulled out a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may possibly not intentionally plan some helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a loan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won no value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as it did not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can only remember Boris Johnson , the first @-@ euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
for this purpose , the Med@@ ley belonged to the tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ domestic , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle about the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I let it be friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bst@@ off tendency and the wild Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s battle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their postpon@@ ement on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege Machine , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not have a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they too have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was made up of a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; key@@ note report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco leadership of P@@ he also took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands be@@ zeich@@ ung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were meant to be a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s alleg@@ ations have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous obligation to inform the public about what proof of evidence and what does not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion pounds per year .
by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ poin@@ ter , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ poin@@ ter and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for public @-@ law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial tim@@ ef@@ ron@@ es against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without any success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ poin@@ ter is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews due to the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts give what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart L@@ ecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ poin@@ ter .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the broadcasting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that one gets a great value here for 150 £ a year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , wonder if that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform , train and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take a look at the public television stations in Australia and Canada .
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances go to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the power @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
read more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called son@@ o@@ genetic that can be used in ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani determined that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the di@@ aphrag@@ ms by some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be revealed in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons suscep@@ tible to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

related News : DS@@ E@@ I We@@ ap@@ ons Fair : author@@ itarian regimes flock to London
but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads the London Under@@ ground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line that turns into the image of a tank .
in September , a flock of arms dealers will drive with the DL@@ R ... Customers are asked to help at the stop of the weapon fair .
the 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cru@@ el Designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped to distribute London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops advertising space on the planet . &quot;

after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , Cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists join activists in protest movements to work and realize that they must go outside into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade posters greet the commu@@ ter in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit @-@ making with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which was around the advertising for the weapons fair - through a empt@@ iness of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step ahead of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors will p@@ ave fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab reveals an order by the US Army on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot by the shoulder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uniqu@@ ely shaped head head that delivers outstanding retro@@ active effects inside the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever that causes it will not be pleasant .
eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those whom I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ tively to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to che@@ at : people tell where you come from , and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ sky , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you hon@@ estly don &apos;t love or hate neither , because in seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were bla@@ sted and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
people often turn into drinks reception , film @-@ night venues and municipal meetings , but they are also places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not think about starting a relationship at university
intro@@ vert gives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you must go away so that I receive the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ ek .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you click .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chi@@ ckens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who are sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbours if it was something for them to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded with still loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to them , separate themselves and see them every day and perhaps see how they move all together friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the limit between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good st@@ ony is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
provide a valuable and am@@ using lesson through hiding - but never miss one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
lock your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but not stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling anymore than twice .
town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Single @-@ De@@ par@@ ing , Low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the single mother and the hel@@ per . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a large part .
in the face of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of dwell@@ ings .
each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ der : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have correctly drawn up my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is particularly complicated that there is always the im@@ min@@ ent Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking place ordin@@ ance .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their town@@ house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ d : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; true , we had a building boom in Germany during the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or of the poor .
I would like to show you how to build a cheap and well @-@ built today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to make room - but Apple has made it more likely to delete the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may turn on half way and this could lead to an abor@@ tion of the update .

district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the staff center Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new focal point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health and care insurance companies .
for years we have been finding out with our out@@ patient care service that often nursing staff are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not too often many services of the insurance companies are not avail@@ ed because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior center for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralised infrastructure necessary in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the opening ceremony , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club sam@@ eness : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ alizing join . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as soon as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 am to 12 pm .

Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most significant architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as stated in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .

parking penalty : Tim meadow th@@ rows a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim meadow is un@@ noticed in Bremen .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he hasn &apos;t appe@@ aled intellec@@ tually .
meadow had just cut off the hair in the Bremen downtown , when he saw how outside a parking space guard stood out for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the meadow then rus@@ hed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the official &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and accused her of the fake money in front of the feet like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the alleg@@ ations , but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it from the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , against 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the youth and struck this with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ bone rup@@ ture and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he left his victim at first .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
under the help of a dr@@ um@@ stick , one beat on the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only one vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and instructions to sign up under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at his side in the next few months .
after a conversion phase Müller opens the practice on 12th October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic at first glance when the field of rock was met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their medical training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and wants to go into practice at the beginning of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was so far , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of pursuing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; proximity and constant contact to patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so they agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in break@@ age @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is engaged in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of break@@ age @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice for the new boss will be prepared as of September 19 .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a home physician .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 Euros will be donated to the Müll@@ ers as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bernd Bor@@ mann &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l about 2000 patients come into the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no follow@@ er had found itself , it would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk session , by the way , continue to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms of the field .
with their f@@ arewell to A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly she already felt after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pushed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would continue to travel on arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also set cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
however , this interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to avoid its limits for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any EU member must fulfill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to travel in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in the night hours to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the near corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
there are mainly Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country is counting around 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , who previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it is the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were travelling the whole night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border crossing Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus it could actually come to a somewhat further west @-@ located route to the previous Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for limit control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have been a good witness to the country since then , regarding the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high refugee figures at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

puls@@ ating , pr@@ un@@ ing life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large tables each with the heading &quot; Before I die I ... &quot;
with this action , E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid drew attention to its 20 @-@ year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as questions and talks as the volunteer workers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by spontaneously interven@@ es to chal@@ k and &quot; my life be@@ j@@ umped , &quot; &quot; says &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; didn &apos;t suffer for a long time , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then proceed .
again and again there are small discussions about the action on itself , about life , how to deal with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that for me at some point the end comes to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ itas Association of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 year old .
however , that not everyone wants to express themselves openly on the tablets , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and dying is still covered with tab@@ oos , the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to opening up the people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Gi@@ ant Gig@@ ant lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its boat transportation service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. announced a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4th and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nevertheless expected that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivers solid income , considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts in@@ quired of six analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express delivery to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the express unit reported higher earnings due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days a week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ storey seat @-@ hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the un@@ parall@@ eled incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate from the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the estate agency Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself sec@@ ures the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase of interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the impact by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value rose by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , head econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed is acting .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % in the previous month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would boost global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when the interest should be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn &apos;t occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be taken into account when making decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 was that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; her monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but are also advised by other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ acting on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lack@@ er , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , dedicated to interest increase , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its body interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limit@@ less noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er .
a year later the F@@ ed representatives returned these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put some aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate fixing .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest rate because markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still teaches her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck in breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , giving babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adap@@ tion that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ as@@ tics workshop at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ park is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously agreed without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , the panel , among other things , had approved an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof over@@ load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be established . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was , in turn , the roof inclin@@ ation prescribed for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for roof inclin@@ ation permits no &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council generally de@@ parts more restric@@ tively in the case of liberation orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for gymn@@ as@@ tics , however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics of the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
grants are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Council of Agriculture for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of hospital GmbH of the district of Land@@ kreis , who confirmed the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will continue to work .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik only since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October onwards and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in every case and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until then next year the former hospital of the prison , which still has 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing rehabilitation at the Hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim is completed .
coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this I conclude from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are currently a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the move to Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure over the past few decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called for the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) .
the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
during the last season , the Ba@@ eres purchased a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and made a good deal there .
hunting with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the aber@@ ration on a ma@@ ize field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use as the police hur@@ ried .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was unclear at first .
the det@@ ective police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses were thrown into a channel in rock enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed a violent crime .
the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police concluded on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , as@@ cer@@ tained to the Tuesday evening , is also considered to be an active person who did indeed give the indication and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday mor@@ nings , after arriving at home on the eve of a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first hit personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the authorities that 16 @-@ year @-@ olds were killed and the cor@@ p@@ ses placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the atri@@ um on Wednesday , and the investig@@ ators put the charge on him .
the decision on the near@@ er circum@@ stance of action shall be carried out by further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing pressures
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights on the German housing market have long begun .
with the coming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building Association &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany .
in this way , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many then stum@@ ble into the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is pushing a housing deficit that becomes bigger from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study , lam@@ ents .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities with no need to stay in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be wai@@ ved on the income tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , attractive fiscal depreciation is necessary according to the alliance .
the funding programme for refugees in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start on Monday evening , with 184 million euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had been retri@@ eved .
now the project could even be raised .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia establish corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the departure of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to Slovenian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary had set off its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day make decent asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbourhood in Croatia in the morning .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not come across the border fence .
for this , the border line hi@@ des other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance is to quickly create a secure passage .
after the closure of the border , almost no more refugees are coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before the gate was closed on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border region as a crime .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the condemned thre@@ aten prison sentences up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees there .
practically no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the tr@@ ash that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the record managers at the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the purpose of this conversion .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after government data .
around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the clearing when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany surprisingly had stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars were ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we have only once smo@@ ked the un@@ trusted guests , with lunch and drinks .
we said we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were switched on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE train in a regional train direction Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was shut down at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ stage run sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly brid@@ ged the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic states in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing stream of refugees and the approaching winter , in which we produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers .
and there will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ fixed quar@@ ts
Konrad has to do all his hands full of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the 20.000 refugees arriving to Austria on Monday were without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quar@@ ts in a he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , some 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide 15,000 to the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the local people .
they would have assured him to create neighbour@@ hoods for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator will also have great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie Wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that lod@@ ges must comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , Konrad reas@@ oned with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom you don &apos;t say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur any costs for the Republic as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
until now , the own search for qu@@ arti@@ s has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz requires a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers are currently able to submit without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations are to be tested for their suitability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other districts must also make their contribution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not regulated &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday under@@ took further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er ass@@ ures me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the guar@@ dians were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also carries out controls on its borders is a logical consequence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ gebiet is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T is drawn into , the remainder ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ Companies in the New Wer@@ ft and later to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours , where Nieder@@ haus@@ er says a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
over 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the heart of the new shop .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la Shop compared to the shop , where they sell , among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and fabrics from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wonder@@ ed if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the region of Linz that sell this stamp , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interests have been placed in the cra@@ dle of her mother .
most of all , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why so some woman in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can &apos;t answer the professional woman with last security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe it &apos;s due to the fact that a beautiful bag uses every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this feature links some even to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself alien@@ ally , journalists are concerned or gaps in knowledge in international crisis policies are revealed - the candidate for the US presidential office sho@@ ots the election campaign strongly .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ hen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ village is related over -@@ zig corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , among which Tr@@ ump also counts the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the city of K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , was &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the employers , she says .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ or .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , where the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative dr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er , retired , sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so ro@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension expert Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm also men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine it from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t want the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ a &apos;s Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president isn &apos;t it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , which was inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump for a long time , have seen 12 000 cin@@ ders , even in the USA arous@@ ed interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavaria municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the Today Reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was aired by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull stri@@ pped the crash of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in the past few months , the gap to Sunrise has closed .
in August , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September , Sunrise is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series production of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wit@@ ted father , who decided to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son was able to wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e resulted in 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
average Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ lap the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly reveal who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood super@@ se@@ des his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have left a ly@@ rical sense of why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods receive last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; her answers could become a game corruption who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed Sarah &apos;s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well @-@ suited as a pair .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood could be &quot; The One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set up on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree is broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the ban@@ ker when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conversion on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Hay@@ ne also strengthened himself in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his crazy catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn sage in big wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land Parliament faction of the Free voters conven@@ es in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e until Friday .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Security Zone for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as was during the n@@ ine@@ ties during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more tangible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the country &apos;s national policy should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing permanent torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot trial &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch &quot; at 47 high schools , where an extension of the secondary school is being tested for three to four years .
but this is not far enough to Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all high schools that want to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free ride at G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is requested .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber stor@@ eys into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , executive district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted on rubber floor .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the tires used , which are known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal in Nepal where members of the ethnic group of the ma@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post shall be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market a 4000 square metre plot in direct proximity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , called it on the part of the city .
which investor does not come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts had been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / Corner of Great Street , already a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented plans for the project for the first time .
some li@@ eger further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , locked doors had been negotiated , gra@@ p@@ pled , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new housing estate near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the mid @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Building , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went into the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project has been discussing about ten to twelve million euros for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers who had come to the meeting called the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and a member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus charges so that this can be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the well one hectare site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans were still variable .

Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our journey there were many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said the first global donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / for more than $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new trial .
it &apos;s still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital took data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach cl@@ atter - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely and 28 % partially dissolved .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in blood glucose levels in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater dec@@ lines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and were rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavy people in Sweden that leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attempted more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is lying with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is currently attrac@@ ting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is most likely to be interesting for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author is grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the hom@@ el@@ ands of refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we need to think about how killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack of September 11 , and found out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the toxic@@ ity control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children can deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens allegedly mixed dis@@ infection agent mixed with soft mou@@ th@@ water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre hospital at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry du@@ els in the school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
your blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally regarded by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor , who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah all@@ u@@ ded her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had kno@@ cked her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ infection agents containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iled them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the vain plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and showed disciplinary action to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the former R@@ angers middle field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights from the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .

after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against ten men from Aber@@ deen , now clearly standing at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly the way - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January transfer
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he hur@@ ried some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new appro@@ vals and insist@@ ing that he does not want to distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this high season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic target person Mich@@ u with reference card
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , suggested that he can withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires with the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with a ru@@ sty kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years and did not manage the departure from Wales on this summer .
Hear@@ ts set on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later aboli@@ shed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ ro@@ ses
the Im@@ proved Hi@@ bee was re@@ proved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn of Edinburgh in front of Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but it is certain that the decline is on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Mc@@ Inn@@ es : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew who won all , in poker games or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is rising .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the numbers of the Office for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ing with the process
as the security personnel could not be able to paci@@ fy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon into custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and initially remained in the custody .
why I am witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day approached , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ ar lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have form@@ ulate it better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts series I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really obj@@ ectively obj@@ ectively .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after a wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he was talking to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a house @-@ peace breakthrough incident in pel@@ vic ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
master soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tries to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ no in Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like the hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had left the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to me that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the opinion that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behaviour and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now letting them think about it .
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw off his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the day yesterday , whatever was like that .
but it was also so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes back ri@@ vals because of claims to ring struggles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ire judges allowed the storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ b of his team and said that at Tac@@ kl@@ ing they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team confi@@ dently agree on him as it means that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ en@@ sive system or the techniques all year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es a real center of gravity , and this has made the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is strange as this always appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a sh@@ it .
but now he has a team that can play and play as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the play of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tests in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment due to his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the agent of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been out of a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the ei@@ vable statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass a daily report to the police and stops at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police hur@@ ried .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident cause torn apart completely .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a girl op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone lack@@ ed and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately alar@@ ming her mother .
the police took care of and saw the five images , then analy@@ zing computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; Web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the public prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the Prosec@@ ution to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year to viol@@ ate the conditions and not to appear before the Court hearing on 24 March this year .
advoc@@ ate lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; is to be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , H@@ og@@ g was granted a ref@@ und@@ able deposit , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other still pending cases .
he was still recorded before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
bad user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken away from the German @-@ Austrian border .
for fear of discovery and arrest , many of the hau@@ lers used to increase people to smaller border cross@@ ings .
out of the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the river river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and bushes .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registry .
according to Federal Police Reg@@ ards , more refugees arrived at Munich Main Railway Station in comparison to the weekly starting date on Wednesday .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 in 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country at present , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful deep is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which in recent days passed from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ abed with Bo@@ ys from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years the cars show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is mainly among the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ sold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Germany ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( public stage 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel introduces a new entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in the view , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door version .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly sporty GT version .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial exec@@ ution@@ er Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to judges , they can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man who is now on the free foot , according to the specifications of his lawyer , had been moved to a larger cell .
his administrative liability due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
but the judges lifted the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons , for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation are decisive , an interpretation of compensation was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disgu@@ sting of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
thus they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April , because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet is also in@@ decent .
in addition to this , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff at that time was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
during the last few weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to head@@ lines due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore locked up again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Department , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young people , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated resolution in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany conve@@ ys the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing are out of the rental price binding , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : there would have to be 80 000 social housing a year and therefore the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion dollars a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there will also be more tax benefits for investing in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that in the long term 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find employment in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the society society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Migration Explorer Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise labour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residen@@ cy obligation to restrict asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in the society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - mostly the view is en@@ forced that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no lack of German knowledge for access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now there is still no adequate offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of networks is , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the Königs@@ weg path to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few @-@ fle@@ dged parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the dis@@ rooted parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ schem@@ as , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ pieces in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators to rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for instance by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal country asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or reimbur@@ sement will not receive any benefits under the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law if they begin studying .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g because they do not fall under the circle of authorized persons .
patient Refu@@ ge@@ es had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span was shortened to 15 months .
but this gap must also be closed , call Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity for many .
the state should gradually embrace Islam as the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches rights continue to develop into a new state religion relationship .
it is also important that the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes willingness to address religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Muslim Central Council , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general equality law since a short decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and why international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany commit must become reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the expected refugees , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is required to hand out health cards to all newcom@@ ers .
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited service catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s performance law envis@@ ages .
apart from that , the doctors mainly make the language barriers possible .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their illnesses than other patients .
it is not only in clinics , but also in medical practices that interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many refugees were also helped with more general medical centers in emergency out@@ patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
with the partly different illnesses German doctors came from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , the refugees may even see relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have been a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , they must demonstrate their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estim@@ ations of the Federal Patent Court ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study of the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ hes and fears .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong terr@@ ability and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees get psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill @-@ looking asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for the psychological illness will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production , the Circus Pro@@ bst draws back to the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group to captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ader and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
thus , the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilomet@@ re long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to take the Cu@@ ban duo loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer the hearts of women in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst captiv@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and artic@@ ulation .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yuan .
snake @-@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and is fascinated with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if the animals are not good , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be picked up by the eyes of any desire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel at ease , it does not want to enter the arena as well .
so the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
specially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst looks proudly .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , the prices are dis@@ counted at 5 pm .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe makes false speech in the parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also encouraged by the asser@@ tions of MEPs from the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address by calling Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones , who warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members that the immunity in the Parliament ends and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its rapidly growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and expanded portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in order to produce electro @-@ equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; the place of birth of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring in order to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation works according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will surely be uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old swing during the high season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win fighting strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career from the way he deserves .
Ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to go ahead with group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the club to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it never worked out at Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lif@@ eli@@ ke and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which spark@@ ed through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football watching in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case even if they often hold back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of telep@@ hon@@ estly care I explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ angers has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria Hel@@ ps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani got a head ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ bs but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the door . he was later changed in the game against his home town team and against the club he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which could hold a 2 : 2 in@@ decisi@@ veness at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Mary .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was str@@ anded with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field , a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes appeared , with some mis@@ prints and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who at no less than five attempts alone in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could get back into the game , and only an excellent grip of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized as a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying matches do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the coal mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is based in Switzerland , hit $ 2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his huge debt redemption plan on Wednesday .
the London registered company Gl@@ en@@ core said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debt .
the company , who lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought a fast @-@ pac@@ ed increase to the top of the London Stock Exchange when trading on the early Wednesday morning .
the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to blo@@ t around one third of its 30 billion $ debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent .

the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and respon@@ ds to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have led bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis Visit will offer the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i have the opportunity to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , previously announced in February , will likely meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i are addressing a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South Chinese sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented a change from FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four champi@@ ons of Champions League vic@@ tors , two times club champi@@ ons , two time champi@@ ons , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won &apos;t do anything at that time , we don &apos;t say anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has gotten me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , folded the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Afgh@@ an film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she is not required behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when it emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not at the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the character of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nut beaten by her white mu@@ d@@ guard .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; at the end her direction &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against colour content .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have its meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation and act as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , is unclear .
American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and user assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the climb on a 75 foot climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge for three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a lifetime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alist , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt as if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended to an eighth season , filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler but played this part perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ our of any game , and therefore I want to concentrate fully into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the pl@@ ywood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ ard , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ d@@ Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen for a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the closing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after he added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , Detroit managed a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by an still not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled off the injury list before the game had been missing for more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ band gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; for the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat end .
the tiger placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ics of the right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP announced Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing since the 20th of August because of a pi@@ er in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , the people in the city will then be accommod@@ ated in the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it calculated with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective displacement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the cup was passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict comes crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back now .
Germany also sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call it concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection would receive it too .
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was expressed in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border with Serbia during the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be locked with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is unlike Serbia on the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence in Hungary . Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants have emerged in Turkey on the way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the iron arm@@ or of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
accordingly , the moon flow@@ ed easily on its orbit around the ring Plan@@ ets .
although this do@@ ve movement is small , but still too big for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the field of &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us it has to give liquid water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes in 2006 at the South Pole of Saturn , which sp@@ ies water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

R@@ ama had compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ald loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think about now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential commitment of a compatible professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his lean line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gan@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
the person who eats the fruits thus supports sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too strong and pleasantly smell .
the peel @-@ color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ go can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the UPS parcel service UPS returns up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , UPS announced on Tuesday .
especially drivers are sought .
already last year , UPS had increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the holiday season .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business .

first fen@@ cing storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ öhn winds up in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ al side , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ st@@ ened on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partially with storm strength through the F@@ öhn@@ t@@ valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest @-@ stream .
on the side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys in the night to the Wednesday of the F@@ öhn .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the F@@ öhn@@ t@@ valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to penetrate into the adjacent centre of the middle , and on the mountains there are even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h possible .
while in the North on Wednesday , F@@ öhn winds for sum@@ mer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the mountain@@ side .
here rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , south of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this after a large amount of rain has already fallen during the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öhn winds up the air , the result is a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind will fres@@ hen up strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures are clearly going back .
the following days are in the north of autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of the town president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ sed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority , often only in hiding their faith .
with the square I become visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a rotten sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , it can be quite ble@@ ak .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
with this he has already fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education already happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to bear my father &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern was to re@@ vit@@ alize art again in a faster time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of image worlds is marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art has been : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old did not pay attention to fully grasp the Bible , but also carefully selected the themes that are important for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arose a picture Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel mod@@ elled for a round course : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway , it was already finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration ensured a breach , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be received in October , the first joint member Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and safegu@@ ards the policy to cope with the problems facing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle that nothing goes on me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can help and want to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal authorities also support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 professional associations set a clear sign if they will be wearing &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot sleeve instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have football teams , no , we have to use our beam strength , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach called for the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their locations was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B option and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of the Management Board loses an eye in the event of an accident
the board of directors of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , impot@@ ent , then tow@@ ed out to the street - this he told us last week , &quot; says the &quot; Wi@@ ki &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully capable of work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again if you like it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mis@@ h ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photograph and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a reserv@@ ist for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us vs K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be absent from the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to practice on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load on its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its trunk to the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of pedi@@ gree Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he training at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the football teacher the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with a high lik@@ el@@ ihood , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ eer Re@@ us that the final turn for the BV@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , Middle @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l holds for comprehensible : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Auto Show IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Mobility Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid rise on digital radio broadcasting .
a test track is currently underway on the motorway 9 in Bavaria for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks will be imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make use of the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site value the authors of the study for about EUR 8.@@ 4 billion for 20@@ 25 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans still look skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the research organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all to believe 31 percent at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed expect to be by 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in Germany , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey by the Digital Association of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in the flowing traffic could be at least 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current status of the title fight from September 25 to October 4 , Düsseldorf , Düsseldorf , wants to only hit the single one .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brig@@ adi@@ er Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor press in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side is , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he was wearing men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the end of the hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , September 18 , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer changed his attitude towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort was done : to fr@@ o the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot moved to Munich according to information from the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers Old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tim@@ id fashion attempts by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to have him .
he later taught the throwing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course I bought them .
he did not have to pay for his first fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion niche
in the past it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who , for example , worked on blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ vements .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en top fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they are already half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ en top and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they must carry the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date with Russia and the United States .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association is also trying to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery pearl in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been leading a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ introduced the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine sticks small spheres at some points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ smith master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I could not start with a traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s top - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be stir@@ red , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already standing : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
the economy has to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership group adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not in question for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally established business environment and is open to the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to conduct business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of the lawyers to ensure their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a session .
at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , have already been so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the currently valid limit values , approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , aims to intensi@@ fy limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of sewage is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans , which accum@@ ulates heavily over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore cau@@ tions that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low quantities can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants hit the Green @-@ German parliament Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
