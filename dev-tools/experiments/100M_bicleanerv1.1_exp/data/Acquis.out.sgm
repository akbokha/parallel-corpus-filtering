<seg id="712">A) The security measures envisaged in this agreement are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. however, the Community considers that the recovery of core material, which is subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention, is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues, so the organisation and the community shall consult each other through the application of appropriate safeguards.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The security measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, insofar as the organisation and the Community shall establish that this core material is virtually non-recoverable.</seg>

<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62, the organisation constitutes a summarized inventory of the whole, the securing measures of this agreement underlying nuclear material in the states, notwithstanding its origin, and continues to carry out this inventory list as a result of the following reports and the results of their audit.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation (GRÜNDE - a) in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by universal suffocation problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution is bound by the Member States within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the allocation of funds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the Organisation of the EWG has presented a table which is intentional in which way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization arranges a special account under the name "special transaction account" which the Member States contribute in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account; this account is referred to as "administrator" by the organization (hereinafter referred to as "administrators"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The fees are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest debtors of the member state, which must be paid on demand in the currency of the relevant state to the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the outlet of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment takes place in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the steward agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may be able to make payments in advance of the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the Administrator obliges approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the Notes to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">By granting these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors according to the EEC conditions:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its additional credit capacity to loan conditions without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly expandable development programme or project (including a sectoral plan), irrespective of whether it is part of the organization's loan program or not, according to the procedures and practices applied to the development loans taken out of ordinary funds provided by the organization, which is to be taken into account under letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordnance means of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the organization, which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="748">Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this clock are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is to be interpreted by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the means is given in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or made in a Member State; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special transaction at the time of loan granted.</seg>
<seg id="752">Cash payments from special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a Membernation is to be rejected as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker holds the EEC on the purposes and programmes approved by the directors for the purpose of auditing all transactions in preparation for the auditing by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the special transaction loans, the administrator reports the EEC as a quarterly basis on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made thereto.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this account conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="756">Following full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EWG transmits as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid to the account and the payments received from the account and the withdrawals to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretakers work closely to achieve the objectives of the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrators up to the full issue of the means of the special interaction account, carry out an exchange of ideas about the status of the special interaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and about all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the Organisation may agree, the agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be due with immediate effect.</seg>
