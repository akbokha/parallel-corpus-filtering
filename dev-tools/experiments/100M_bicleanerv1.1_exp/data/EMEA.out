this document is a summary of the European Public Pro@@ vision Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ y thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psychological condition whereby the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elation ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to treat man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to take or the melting tablets can be applied to patients causing difficulty swal@@ lowing .
in patients who take other medicines that are taken at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole works primarily as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is helping to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ r@@ ence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of the symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that were suffering from increased anxiety over a period of two hours compared to a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased un@@ rest , compared with the response of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined by means of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients referring to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb ( records ) .
in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly reduced in the symptoms of increased anxiety than those receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short term studies .
furthermore , up to 74 weeks of efficacy , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled ) , acute ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of abili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared with the risks .
in addition , the Committee found that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , when oral therapy is not suitable to weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy to the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day , regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
a lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a replacement of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no higher suicide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ i@@ er@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy show signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be de@@ posed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ istry and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ morph@@ ological / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ morph@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data storage for humans and because of the concerns raised in the reproductive studies of the animal , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as in other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - A controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13,@@ 1 % for patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from ap@@ eri@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally tran@@ sit@@ ory and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
adverse events reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence after treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
there is no information on the efficacy of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ and , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ t .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who received a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in a lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value in significantly fewer patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy superior to plac@@ ebo in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy comparable to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
moreover , in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of Man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , which in part had not responded to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy at therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed an superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period of 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before Rand@@ om@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed himself superior to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lic regulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ age is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study in patients with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular haz@@ ards to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans , so that they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ kidney cancer and combined adren@@ al @-@ kidney @-@ aden@@ omas / carcin@@ oma in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole do not exceed 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution is used for rapid control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ v@@ enting obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution to take .
there are no tests on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including cel@@ i@@ er@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ istry and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after all@@ some administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15@@ mg doses ) were used in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly while receiving Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( poor &apos; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , the common application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in high effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular received , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared with that after all@@ some gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % for patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not show any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally tran@@ sit@@ ory and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
adverse events reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence after treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms with regard to the det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference Low .
the mean improvement from bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who received a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ Rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ l ( oral ) significantly reduced the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in a lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred , significantly fewer patients reported a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , which in part had not responded to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy at therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed an superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before Rand@@ om@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy test subjects , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after use .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application there was no safety @-@ relevant concern after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular haz@@ ards to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans , so that they have limited or no meaning for the clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ kidney cancer and combined adren@@ al @-@ kidney @-@ aden@@ omas / carcin@@ oma in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 @-@ fold of the mean regular @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean regular @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 81 times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mid @-@ stable @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole application or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments from their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low levels of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils before the beginning of treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other medicines containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el it would not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the lack of first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
for sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Level 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been conducted with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulated by Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no recur@@ rent abrasion cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils have risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l again .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac rel@@ ap@@ ses in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ pi@@ ents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to leave no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sper@@ mac@@ eration , because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the traffic density and the ability to operate machinery .
listed below are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated at the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated levels of cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the lower abdom@@ en , ul@@ c@@ ers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the mer@@ ging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ a and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ u@@ bu@@ le network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in im@@ parts the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the course of in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ ic transfer is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tumor is occurring due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ f@@ aded trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized phase III study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer in 30 minutes .
this multic@@ entre study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el mon@@ otherapy every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for general response rate and time to disease progression as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ic grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substance ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or crossover network of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the removal of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 43 % ) as a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ ised medicine and , as in other potentially toxic substances , be careful when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe we are slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a bottle of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
after the complete addition of the solution , the glass bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the water bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete discharge of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ ks are visible , the glass filter must be inver@@ ted sof@@ tly in order to achieve a complete residual suspension before application .

member states must ensure that the holder of the authorisation for the placing on the market provides medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail libraries with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging contributions . • With a clear picture of the correct use of the product , cooling boxes for the transport by patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicinal product approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medical prescription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood cancers that could occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who wish to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no lack of iron , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that em@@ powers them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
as an injection into a v@@ ein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medical drug as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between weeks 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
stre@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the requirements of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which produces Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the marketing of ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ emia and reduction of the need for trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , receiving chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical interventions requiring large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex , and overall disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed via or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose which is required for the control of an@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose : 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using the intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose which is required for monitoring an@@ emia symptoms .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the initial storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , ab@@ se@@ amed should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the sc@@ out therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation system .
patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin at er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive an ab@@ se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies ) .
the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous don@@ or program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the oti@@ d or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ te should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ um@@ toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers should be determined and if no other reason of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row is considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the administration of epo@@ e@@ tin if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of the an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the treatment efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 , to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment under the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients intended for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated if possible prior to the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease .
furthermore , treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of postoperative endo@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumour tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
on th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , isch@@ em@@ ic thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
irrespective of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically @-@ extracted epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ ated and is identical with the endo@@ genous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , an endo@@ genous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ asis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 64 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .
1895 patients with solid tum@@ ors ( 6@@ 83 m@@ am@@ mal carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 174 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tum@@ ours , and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis .
survival and tumour progression were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
the open study showed no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ae er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ae Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin were consistent with an@@ emia due to a number of common malign@@ omas consistent an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa conditions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels that are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to a dimin@@ ished federal body weight , to a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports support in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

they suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or of the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ forms again in further treatment .
your doctor may perform regular blood tests if necessary , in order to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before starting the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rarely , er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ a after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how best to treat your an@@ a@@ emia .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
with elevated or increasing levels of potassium , your doctor may consider a dis@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 weeks delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your red blood ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) values and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly in order to minimize the risk of drop@@ let formation ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the advantages derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ ose or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and may neg@@ atively affect the tumour under certain circumstances .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly prior to the commen@@ cement of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of red blood ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of drop@@ let formation after the operation .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests showed no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the state is under control .
in order to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before the surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery .

Ac@@ cur@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a minor damage to the hip as in the case of H@@ inf@@ allen ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
in order to treat the disease Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate the Ac@@ up@@ a .
the first study included almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ up@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate for six months ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) with those of plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ credited had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ up@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ cur@@ a must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions at the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ up@@ a manufacturer provides clari@@ fication material for doctors prescri@@ bing Ac@@ cur@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains clu@@ es how to apply the medicine , as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the transport of Ac@@ till@@ a throughout the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic frac@@ ture frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous 5 mg acet@@ one in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , Ac@@ cur@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get disease .
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient supply of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ till@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ up@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) Pati@@ ents with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended as limited clinical experience for these patients .
a dose adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ up@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data on safety and efficacy are absent .
Ac@@ up@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia is to be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia may develop because of the quick release of the effects of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone structure , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient supply of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with adequate preventive denti@@ stry .
no data is available for patients who require dental interventions , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of acet@@ am@@ ol may be reduced shortly after application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious side effects reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 out of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ up@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was associated with ren@@ al dysfunction , which was associated as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. increasing the serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the creation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before administration ) and the occurrence of ren@@ al failure and impaired ren@@ al function in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years were comparable to the plac@@ ebo group and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ credited to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred at 2.3 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after frac@@ ture frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of cit@@ ric acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been know@@ ingly , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial region in one patient with ac@@ la@@ a and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in case of an over@@ dose leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia , calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate in@@ fusion can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T score for the leg neck ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric head frac@@ tures Ac@@ till@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of 60 % for ed@@ dy frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures Ac@@ cur@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a raised the bone density at the lum@@ bar flu@@ oric acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.1 % , the stem @-@ neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ la@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vis .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone mass and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular mar@@ row architecture compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of Ac@@ last@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ credited , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .

the treatment carried out over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the total th@@ igh and 4.3 % on the th@@ igh .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in response to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of acet@@ one compared to the once weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar @-@ verteb@@ ra@@ e @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ cur@@ a was studied in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moderate severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value when taken into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of cit@@ ric acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for ac@@ la@@ a and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( referred to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 patients with Ac@@ last@@ a and 107 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose independent .
after that , plasma levels rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ ologic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ -@@ 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ sis time t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early phases of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ed to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance of metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because zinc acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 patients examined .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function disorder until a cre@@ at@@ inate @-@ Clear@@ ance down to 35 m@@ L / min requires no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
since severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is only limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ Latvian intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight in mice .
in the case of studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C ) have been administered thre@@ ef@@ old of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al compatibility of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron A@@ ci@@ d was determined in rats using doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use of accumulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common occurrence of repeated use studies was a prolifer@@ ation of primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats were observed with ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in doses ranging from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum calcium level .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Pro@@ vision Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine ( dual therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which can not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily set with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl di@@ ure@@ a or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ substance or insulin may be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin and insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in the process , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl hard material , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos has led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced to 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic agent in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common side @-@ effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ aes@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) to develop a de@@ compensated heart failure , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ belly pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked .
the decision on whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should continue until the clinical assessment has been conducted .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which may be due to fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
a slight reduction of mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ uses ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of hem@@ at@@ el@@ ution .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with insulin or as two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported to have a incidence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but failing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for investigating cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment is to be replaced ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies to investigate the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ogen@@ esis of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ chol@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ ine , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; commonly &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the index of the lens as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents over the three @-@ fold the upper limit of the norm tend to be similar to plac@@ ebo but less often than in comparison groups among met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ants .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ ides .
since the market launch it was rarely reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups .
over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the recorded maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat , and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the production of glu@@ cos@@ amine in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the start of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization were random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
clinical trials for one year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study on type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while negative values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a study over 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both about an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to oral application , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered sp@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ Dynam@@ ics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after the oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was mainly found in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimination rate of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume increase with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ chol@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting from the gest@@ ation and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ ine , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a resulted in increased frequency of color@@ ec@@ tal tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for investigating cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study of more than two years , the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated .
clinical trials for 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study over 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both about an effect on the lac@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study failed to target its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kl@@ es , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ vit@@ alization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not ent@@ ail cardiovascular long@@ term risks .

ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced similarly to another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of packages ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in treating diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar settings have improved significantly , for example , by intensive insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin in animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage required .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosing or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take account of possible interactions with the therapy and consult his patients always after other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , however , can gradually develop : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape picking , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid person or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by spl@@ itting is active .

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may also need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin quickly acting must first be absorbed , followed by the amount of long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosing or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to collect the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the date of performance - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection point Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma occur at the injection site ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that a 42 % reduction in mortality associated with intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) decreased by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

always set the cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let ready p@@ ens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the protective tab from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • N@@ ail the injection needle straight and firmly to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Remove the large outer cap of the injection needle and the internal cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • Take a few times with your finger gently against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will accum@@ ulate in the cartridge at the top • Whi@@ le you continue the injection needle , rotate the cartridge by one click in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle still shows upwards , press the push button completely ( Figure C ) • Now you have to leave a drop of insulin out of the tip of the injection needle .
• Set the cap again in such a way that the digit 0 is opposite the feeder ( Figure D ) • Check that the button is pressed completely .
if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed from the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the cap • The scale below the push button ( pus@@ h@@ button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number you can see on the press scale • add the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap forward or backward until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
rotate it until the push button is down and you feel a resistance , then take off the cap and reset it so that the 0 of the metering mark is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during the injection process • Ke@@ ep the button pressed completely after the injection until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • you can &apos;t set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can not use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ mal crystals that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels still exceed 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
sei@@ zur@@ es may still occur during the first months of treatment , so it is recommended that patients continue to use other medicines for preventing g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months under treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the one plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once received 120 mg daily during the last three measurements had a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
particularly in patients with cardiac problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in deposits ( including a toxic@@ ity known from the history of the disease and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum res@@ is@@ tive level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure is not recommended with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ sa@@ wing medicines , acute toxic@@ ity may occur during the treatment beginning , because ur@@ inary acid deposits can first be mobili@@ sed in the tissues by lowering the serum resin acid level .
B. for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine is so common in rare cases that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
during Phase 3 clinical studies light ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen were associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .

in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily demonstrated an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be ruled out on side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or performing hazardous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could be observed in the treatment arms with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients suffering from hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the commonly used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum carcin@@ oma ( 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the serum product pi@@ eg@@ els to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained continuously throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum carcin@@ oma &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. H ) .
the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) was achieved with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum levels in patients , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent lowering of the serum res@@ is@@ tivity levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of toxic@@ ity ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the sperm volume size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out nodes until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long@@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportion@@ ately .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum levels , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ely cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found to be un@@ changeable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7,5 m / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ , h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( chil@@ dr@@ y@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary tum@@ ours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , in about 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered non @-@ relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
in case of high doses , which were about 3 times the refrac@@ tive medical exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which are approximately 4.@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are approximately 13 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active agent used at the same time .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe skin ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
21 Open @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the permanent lowering of the serum res@@ is@@ tivity levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of toxic@@ ity ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .

the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market has to ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application is ready before the drug is put into circulation , and as long as it is available as the medicine is brought into circulation .
according to the CH@@ MP guidelines , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the CH@@ MP guidelines .
in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available that has an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ eu@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities for risk minim@@ ization • within 60 days after reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of the E@@ MEA
in some people ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations which are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ inary acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the crystal formation is prevented and in this way with time a reduction of the discomfort is achieved .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC must not be taken , if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine • if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high level of ur@@ inary acid concentration in a result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disorder where too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) .
if you have a stroke at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the attack is cancelled before starting the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be the case with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , when you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to you if necessary , in order to prevent a toxic@@ ity or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medications that contain one of the following substances , since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may possibly consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ ur@@ in ( for the treatment of the immune defence ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease )
no studies have been carried out on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on the traffic density and the ability to operate machinery .
please take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC after consultation with your doctor if you know that you are suffering from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
on the back of the bli@@ ster pack , the single days of the week are printed , so that you can check whether you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of a small vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also provided data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) , as well as sour up@@ bringing .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it may not be applied in case of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . approval for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE within the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of ris@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ations and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or take the tablet into the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ r@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as est@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients receiving al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to stop the medicine in case of symptoms of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ y , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ st@@ ale pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the appearance of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dispens@@ ing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was observed , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a were rare ( after market launch ) , including some severe and with complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy region contains mainly IV bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates administered intraven@@ ously .
there are no data available to indicate whether the replacement of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients need@@ ing a jaw @-@ surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is author@@ itative for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to use AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the next morning while taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but keep taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the planned week of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in clinical trials was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
however , the serum levels of serum levels of up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
an oral over@@ dose can cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , est@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a .

the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ mia , the weakness of the proxim@@ al muscles and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie can lead to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic people .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly decreased the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 12 % vs .
the therapeutic equi@@ val@@ ence of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D tot@@ aled 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction in the plac@@ ebo group ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo was 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients suffered from one or more ed@@ dy frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ phy continued to hold ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the incidence of at least one new frac@@ ture frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fast@@ ings and two hours before intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies of rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily divided into soft tissues after an intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate approximately 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .
following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems in humans .
res@@ or@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after the gift of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after ni@@ gh@@ tly fast and two hours before taking a meal , the mean surface was below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without taking into consideration endo@@ genous vitamin D3 mirror ) .

Advent is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , comparing the application of Adv@@ agra@@ ph with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was abor@@ ted after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious if others ( in particular some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with a paragraph , as the advance dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or super@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the closely mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirror should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ t phase .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear@@ ness substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schema can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of use In order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustments can later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a gra@@ ft recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules should be converted to once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this change@@ over has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
after mig@@ rating from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to an advoc@@ ate once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection must begin with the recommended oral initial dose in the case of kidney and liver transplantation .
in adult patients who are converted to Advent , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ t patients , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day for patients with pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood frac@@ tures in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum carcin@@ oma , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ lays and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph When switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , be careful ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on tal@@ low levels in full blood The dose should be based primarily on clinical evaluation of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the help of full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood sugar levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by adjustment of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ age adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that might alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
because Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood are not exceeding 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the full blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may result in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the closely mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have been shown to be therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph for the prevention of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients .
because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ sm levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements that contain St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , catar@@ acts described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy were observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical dis@@ ruption are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons due to suitable clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since advanced hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contain , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption are special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by inhibit@@ ing gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious when making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of tests on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in contrast to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of adverse events is the outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) , i.e. :
the adverse event profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be precisely identified because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .

cases of BK @-@ Virus associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and high binding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be conveyed through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , furthermore the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

lung transplantation An interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be switched to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients being converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases where no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ative syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) trial or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on the 5 .
col@@ on transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ cl@@ onal trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive in color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ tations showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in case of stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital heart defect caused by the lack of Factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether or not Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A is a factor of VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic episodes with &quot; excellent &quot; respectively &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to Factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II @-@ deficiency , the location and the extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the indicated plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
inj@@ ections all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute draw@@ back are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in response to Factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vivo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses ranging from 20 to 40 I.@@ U. of Factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity cannot be reached or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VI@@ II is a well known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modi@@ fying Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates to the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of whom had previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirrors in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance @-@ Rate again showed adequate values on the 15 postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE an 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) diagnosed a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that were allergic to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were informed about the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic person , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes it necessary to submit P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , so that the authorisation holder should apply for further extension procedures in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the body &apos;s cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ assemblies , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the initial documentation submitted , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in injection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore provides benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever caused by allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 or older , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ol is twice daily a tablet to be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are rejected .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment commen@@ ced and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried off their symptoms every 12 hours to a diary and assessed using a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ y fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ os@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving deser@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from severe glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardiac or vascular diseases , including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , crus@@ hing or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , aer@@ os@@ ol should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease over time in case of long @-@ term use .
after swelling of the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , respectively within the 2 weeks after termination of such treatment .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which can be used per@@ onal or nas@@ ally as a hin@@ ge of r@@ hin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this group of patients and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ functions and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or a strengthening of the head@@ aches ) has to be dis@@ continued .
treatment of the following patient groups is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck building or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be completed at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests because anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions .
no clin@@ ically relevant interactions nor changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed in the framework of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor system , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vivo , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to an impair@@ ment of the traffic density or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ no@@ ea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ ce procedures .
head@@ aches , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart@@ beat , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ dant pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P sel@@ ec@@ tivity to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
at a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess in the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage may cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared with the overall result for the symptoms ( except mu@@ cous membrane swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined on the basis of nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study of the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the plasma dose .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were poor@@ ly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to be exposed after the administration of an aer@@ os@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot identify any particular hazard to humans .
the combination did not have any greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms which occur in connection with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .

after the market launch of Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing not , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver diseases was also very rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had asthma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by comparing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ no@@ od@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the scores ( symptom scor@@ ing ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in both studies at ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the scores after six weeks with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms termin@@ ate and can be resum@@ ed at their recur@@ r@@ ence .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed about the fact that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to an impair@@ ment of the traffic density or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials across different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ aches ; this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes both in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P sel@@ ec@@ tivity to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study of multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) for more than ten days , there was no prolon@@ gation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including the reinforcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be easily rec@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that , besides the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to an improvement in the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the study was excluded from the study by the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines .
an improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of the patients .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ o@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot identify any particular hazard to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken separately from meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ se and experience a higher number of substances ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who are normal metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems should not use glucose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ free absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical doses ) .
children between 1 and 11 years of age , who were eligible for anti @-@ hist@@ amine use , received a daily total dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no prolon@@ gation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers did not detect an increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
with an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not imp@@ air psych@@ om@@ otor therapy .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in increasing alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment or increasing drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited @-@ metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) due to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bre@@ wing bottles with a child@@ proof polypropylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

in clinical trials across different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical doses ) .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Des@@ o@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for the dec@@ lining formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in an additional study , at a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers did not detect an increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also be used in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. formally announced that the company re@@ jects its application for approval for the launch of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against the flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
when the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the part of the flu virus , which is contained in the vaccine , and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies faster when contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane she@@ ath of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the surface of the membrane that the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) was dis@@ connected , cleaned up and used as part of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data basis for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA Gu@@ idance on pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has tested which an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient had previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby also the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which has been dos@@ ed with low doses , was compared with 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load enhanced with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r lowered the viral load as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 16 weeks of treatment :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a stronger waste of the viral load together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after four weeks , compared with the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase must also not be used in patients receiving St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicine , which are degra@@ ded as well as aging and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in body fat distribution ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( bone tissue death ) or immune activation syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of generic ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the transport of a@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are usually to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ dynam@@ ite as a solution to take up is 14 % less than from Am@@ dynam@@ ite as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ dynam@@ ite twice a day together with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhanced addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ and@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ dynam@@ ite that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate @-@ severe liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily .
con@@ current use should be performed with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ dynam@@ ite ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
in case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Cus@@ hing Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ag@@ ro@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active ingredient concentration .
in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the nature of the interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ dynam@@ ite , the patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ori@@ de content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be applied with care in certain other patient groups .
aging should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to which drugs were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medi@@ ums with low therapeu@@ tical l@@ atitude must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should not be combined with medicines whose active agents are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ dynam@@ ite , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance .
in attempting to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ dynam@@ ite can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient has already received St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ our mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and replace the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ dynam@@ ite ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ dynam@@ ite Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials doses of 600 mg of Am@@ dynam@@ ite twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % reduced if Am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bu@@ o@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the fanta@@ sic component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and a@@ gener@@ ase lie at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
for this reason , in combination with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ dynam@@ ite and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine effects on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r .
should these medicines be used simultaneously , caution is advisable since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
caution must be taken when these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ dynam@@ ite and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half of the recommended dose although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ast@@ er@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of f@@ os@@ cop@@ yr@@ cavi@@ ties and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed once daily without con@@ current application of f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including medi@@ ums , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may also interact with aging .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with a@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase as it may result in res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants , known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma cruci@@ ble of Am@@ dynam@@ ite .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Israel@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
simultaneous use with a@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the fluor@@ os@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous administration of gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected simultaneously .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ od@@ our is not recommended .
a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations can be recommended until the mirror stabili@@ zation , since the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , ag@@ it@@ ase cannot be used together with the or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is required .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as to how to adjust the Am@@ dynam@@ ite dose if Am@@ dynam@@ ite is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
increased monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people in breast milk .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given from the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight in the seed .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on the parent animal .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , rising early and rarely led to the breakdown of the treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the adverse events mentioned below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as associated with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ al fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stick @-@ ch@@ opping ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes were usually mild to moder@@ ately marked , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ dynam@@ ite .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with a severe immunity defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of ag@@ ro@@ ase twice a day along with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; one exception were increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were frequent in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the connection between the activity of Am@@ dynam@@ ite against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ ls / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ mat@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of f@@ os@@ cop@@ yr@@ r with 100@@ mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred by week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 sealed patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors demonstrated resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of F@@ ossi@@ p @-@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors treated patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / S , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of specific mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests .
each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r creates a certain resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r , however , remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross resistance between amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance path@@ ways , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally non @-@ treated patients , in which a f@@ os@@ cope virus ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear .
on the other hand , amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failing therapy is recommended in order to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which adults treated with a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ slip threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ oo@@ ster@@ ated ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children between 2 and 18 years of age , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s treated together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ dynam@@ ite ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ dynam@@ ite with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound ammon@@ ium which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ia remains constant fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
for this reason , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily ammon@@ ia exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the impact of ren@@ al dysfunction may be low on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those that are achieved in healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , correspon@@ ded .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the actual exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeu@@ tical applications , there was little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of a@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both in the controls and in the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure that was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us on@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhanced addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ and@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ dynam@@ ite that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
con@@ current use should be performed with caution in patients with low or mild liver dysfunction , contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active ingredient concentration .
aging should be set in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ dynam@@ ite , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance .
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ dynam@@ ite Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bu@@ o@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ dynam@@ ite and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
caution must be taken when these drugs are used together ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ dynam@@ ite and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although no clinical data is available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Israel@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the fluor@@ os@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
increased monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given from the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in weight during the lac@@ tation period .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ dynam@@ ite in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ia remains constant fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active components during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
for this reason , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the impact of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in male animals occurred in dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical applications , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both in the controls and in the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ ile the metabolism path@@ ways are not yet fully developed , so that amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to take is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
the benefit of using k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; fried &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase solution to take was not proven in patients treated with PI or with PI .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ dynam@@ ite as a solution to take up is 14 % less than from Am@@ dynam@@ ite as a capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ and@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ dynam@@ ite which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation is required for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination may be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for Am@@ dynam@@ ite is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ori@@ de content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in case of small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active ingredient concentration .
aging should be set in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ dynam@@ ite , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a development of resistance .
50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ dynam@@ ite Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous use with a@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and result in P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase plasma concentrations by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to inhal@@ ation may not be applied to the present Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people in breast milk .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight in the offspring .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ ls / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ mat@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large ve@@ al volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week in case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
the cream is to be applied to the affected skin areas before bed@@ time , so that it remains on the skin sufficiently long ( approximately eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream but without the active agent ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo spread either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a showed a total healing rate of 66 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream can be continued until all visible asc@@ ents have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the course of treatment described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual treatment plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the clean@@ sed skin area in the clean@@ sed skin until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should be weigh@@ ed between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should be weigh@@ ed between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pres@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a strike leading to circumcision .
an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experiences are currently available for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external tendencies in the genital and peri@@ al@@ an@@ al@@ gia .
limited data indicate an increased rate of suscep@@ ti@@ bility reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the cow@@ ls .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be done several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment .
since no data is currently available on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered for super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the use of previously treated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data about the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the efficacy in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease over the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions are causing great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ ating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not produce direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were achieved either after a unique top@@ ical application ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions on the site of treatment of the fo@@ als ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the B@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , most likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
this evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently led to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / dra@@ fting ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the study protocol , the clinical evidence planned according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very common to severe er@@ y@@ issues ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too heavy scor@@ ching and cal@@ ci@@ fication ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies evaluating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental single oral shot of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the most clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200@@ mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or IV levels of hydr@@ ation .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were demonstrated after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the tendencies in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is significantly superior .
at 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the disease was completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , vs. 5 % of 161 male patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ stroke applications per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary structural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ ker@@ ato@@ tic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne l@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clin@@ ically healing after one or two treatment periods .
the permitted indications of external fo@@ als , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose and super @-@ cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream has been studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , Plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml for the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month trial for the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en @-@ weight ; a study for the der@@ mal application , which was carried out for four months , yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with der@@ mal administration on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ours in the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for humans is considered to be very small due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ating movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ alizing equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines before they are administered to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of the G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by approximately 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in over 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will check all the new information , possibly known , and update this summary if necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients receiving al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect related to in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a proper clinical environment where rehabilitation centres are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related response must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience with the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer period of time , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously preceded by an interruption of the treatment .
treat 60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions .
in the event of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related response , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related response , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is present on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were mostly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older for a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often performed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory tract and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and a duration of treatment of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patients aged under 5 years of age usually came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ kon@@ y .
patients with low @-@ low antibody levels reported a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ an activity in vitro that appeared not to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even though the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely over man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute minimum distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement of lung function and ability to be healed compared to the plac@@ ebo group , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V has not been clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the size of adults .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first four weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous clinical manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , which summari@@ zes clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal Fe@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) was observed .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirrors in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients , a growth in size ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) noted after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form indicated a normal mental develop@@ mental speed , whereas in the older patients with severe follow @-@ up form only limited or no progress was observed in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a substitute alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available to evaluate each year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to those affected by elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a one @-@ time administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data will not be able to detect particular haz@@ ards for humans .
since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed below 6.@@ 6. .

the holder of the authorisation for the placing on the market has to conclude the following program of studies within the given time , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide longer @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase that breaks down certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have caused a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians or medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory tract and facial oils .
frequent ( occurrence at more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • Joint ail@@ ments , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • Er@@ red@@ ding • fever • ch@@ ills • increased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available to evaluate each year , and if necessary , the package supplement will be updated .
if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it should not be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of defl@@ ection bottles to be dil@@ uted according to body weight of the individual patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( cancer for cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and obtain inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , in addition to or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given .
in patients whose blood counts are changed or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , de@@ posed or the dose can be reduced .
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study to 5@@ 71 patients with advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time of 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells when administration of A@@ lim@@ ta treated longer lives compared with the comparative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the glass bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - kal @-@ advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed @-@ Gift and the day after the treatment .
at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed and the dose must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first match @-@ mixed dosage as well as after each third operating cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ emet@@ ry , a full blood image should be created before each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose examination must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive treatment cycles .
after the recovery patients have to be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Level 2 Blood .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- a ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or continue with the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , an increased risk of adverse effects exists in patients aged 65 years or above .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a C@@ ret@@ an @-@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin border value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the occurrence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored in terms of bone mar@@ row intra@@ ocular pressure and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed cannot be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again have a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tes again has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was considered when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed need to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( C@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients receiving a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients experiencing these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed @-@ treatment .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damaging of the reproductive capacity by means of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treatment chin to obtain advice regarding the sper@@ mac@@ eration .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ sis ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced p@@ emet@@ ry de@@ position resulting in increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is recommended if patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used for high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds is available with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the t@@ ine status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy require an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy except if it is strictly required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity by means of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the block@@ age of the sper@@ mac@@ ia .
it is not known whether it is mixed in breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes that are important for cell rep@@ lication .

E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ized , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had clin@@ ically meaningful advantage of survival compared to those patients who were only cur@@ led with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving treatment arms ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole pec@@ tin @-@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the difference between the two arms hu@@ bs resulted in an improvement of lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC followed prior chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separate random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar for p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
medi@@ an PFS was 4,@@ 8 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 3@@ 0,@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine in c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Frequ@@ ency interval ; IT@@ T = A @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ slip limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te ker@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
the patients also needed er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed as a mon@@ o@@ therapeutic agent were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ions over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is largely left in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine within 24 hours of the application .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed has a total score of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life time in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing 90 ml / min ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ation ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients taking All@@ i and unable to list weight after 12 weeks should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , resulting in a quarter of the fats led with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients with All@@ i had 60 mg of weight after one year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking plac@@ ebo .
the study of all@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with mar@@ row , mar@@ row ld@@ l , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , departure o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( fa@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or in nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ induced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is however only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • E@@ mpt@@ iness ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated blood cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take extra contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentration of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not predictable ) .
the frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
most of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the lip@@ ase inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect forms in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of ga@@ str@@ ic and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter that changes the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months , the greatest loss of weight occurred in the first six months .
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , for therapeutic dos@@ ages , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be proved spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ t@@ onal ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , identified nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration in a study of obes@@ e patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be seen as a special danger to humans .

the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks following the beginning of the treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise nutritional defici@@ encies : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction .

permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious illness and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find on food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories that is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , it is essential to observe the recommended intake of fat .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompan@@ im@@ ents .
34 This reduced calorie intake should enable you to gradually and continuously lose weight about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Lack of physical activity &quot; means that you can burn up to 150 k@@ cal every day , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal per day , i.e. by 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ inflammatory ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the drug inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined for 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy regi@@ mens , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 from 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute is@@ le@@ us after injection should be tightly monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is offered with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that leng@@ then the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to be an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron hibited the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics directed against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ ine and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pl@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ i@@ ti@@ dine , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Clear@@ ance .
experiences regarding the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least could be associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the date of performance ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; no dose @-@ active relationships were observed .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with an al@@ op@@ ic over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25@@ mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving significantly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy individuals and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to three consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) compared to the one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the use of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy patients , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elimination rate is increased and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , but a reduction in the dose is therefore not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only on ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicated that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) which were given daily over two years led to increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is estimated to be low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommended for the use of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml Inj@@ ection Solution for the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medical prescription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon is to be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue shows damage , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amino acid fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medical drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus were detected in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
in addition , concerns have been vo@@ iced that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C related to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease decreased again in more patients than in the reference medical device ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon has more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study was not adequately vali@@ dated to determine the extent to which the drug acts as an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection accompanied by cru@@ sts ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ds ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or likely caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
alt@@ ar@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin area to be treated must not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients treated with plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were considered together with skin patients , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with alt@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the ordering site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go within the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is to be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected spot occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on de@@ ported skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean return of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines o@@ int@@ ment on pe@@ dic@@ ated skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical retin@@ os@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with alt@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , it is possible to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go used was the most frequently reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the date of the administration , affecting about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , partially blocking P @-@ binding interactions , preventing the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at at least some infection forms seem to be question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us were detected , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and pe@@ eled skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last use .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after top@@ ical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) is 6@@ 60 times lower than the retina in@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro screening on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 worn skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , at oral dosing ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while im@@ muni@@ zation and ensures that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end .
if a refresh dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the in@@ oc@@ ul@@ ant Twin@@ Master Ad@@ ult , which has been approved since 1996 and the mandatory vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ su@@ i children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ su@@ c adults and Twin@@ su@@ c children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix took between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ ence protection was similar in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who are potentially hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als Inc . a permit for the placing on the market of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for Pri@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is given after the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shot is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to hepatitis B vacc@@ ination need a booster shot as protection , as they may also be protected by the immun@@ ological memory in case of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , it is recommended that the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units contains a Hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value is achieved after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the administration of other vacc@@ ines may be required .
since an in@@ tra @-@ male injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration of the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , Ambi@@ ence can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ tic@@ - m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that an adequate immune response may not be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ gency , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ age and preserv@@ ative formulation .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ination doses of Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines between 1 and 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ urities on a calculation basis per cap@@ ita dose , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of subjects administered by Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ urities was comparable highly per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who got Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ urities was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparison study of 1 to 11 years of in@@ oc@@ ulation , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ence group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ence a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical studies carried out at the age of 1 to 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ can vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme for persons who were between 12 and 15 years of age .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units with form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was possible to show that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time with the booster of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps @-@ scor@@ ing vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and serum conversion rates as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing to any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food@@ borne foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as water contaminated by water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both doses of vacc@@ ination , ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B in your child , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the vacc@@ ination series ends .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ enses , or if you / your child undergo hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis / sub@@ tract .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take / take other medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / or have received / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or that is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
traditionally , Ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix request inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 multiplied t@@ ins ) : • pain or discomfort at the punc@@ ture or redness • Mat@@ ty • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches • lack of appetite
♦ A common ( up to one case per 10 capsules ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • He@@ at di@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 associated doses ) are reported :
these include loc@@ alised or extended ras@@ hes , which can be it@@ chy or ves@@ ic@@ le , swelling of the eye area and face , ag@@ grav@@ ating breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .
flu @-@ like ail@@ ments , including ch@@ ills , muscular and joint pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , irrit@@ ation such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ants running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , diseases of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , interruption of normal brain functions

23 Information your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you / your child or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on data acquired since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP showed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine are limited because of low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - split by several individual doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ eme ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ ial could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active substance ) .
am@@ mo@@ sis can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste problems , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented excessive ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of the lifetime ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) then there is an indication of the use of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ b phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ b@@ scar@@ is .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ inate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk of the gen@@ esis of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be applied with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as for clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and oil formation .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of the patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to be associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ex@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , bul@@ let@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting ne@@ uro @-@ toxic@@ ity when administered intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of surplus nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram taken in sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease itself led to death even when treated with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues in the first year of life .
through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ b@@ scar@@ path@@ ian deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney by glut@@ amine with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also investigated in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ kl@@ oric disorder or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) did not det@@ ectable phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma after a noc@@ tur@@ nal fast .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no auto@@ cla@@ ved effects when treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children not yet able to swal@@ low the tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ a or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ b phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ b@@ scar@@ is .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the brain cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ex@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , bul@@ let@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
according to rum@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the secre@@ tion of surplus value .
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste disturbances , rel@@ ap@@ se of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment .
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to the same single doses or over a ga@@ stri@@ c ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Apply a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended amount of measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
nearly 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in the sole application or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients were often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they received additional medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab und A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without GP@@ I administration - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ vit@@ alization ) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective in terms of all indicators such as he@@ par@@ in , except in severe bleeding where it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox should not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as for people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is used in a further sequence , an additional 0.5 mg / kg can be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
an injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be given immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the use of the an@@ odi@@ ac should be given intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second intake dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second intake dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which was admitted to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us with no dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tioned He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible irrit@@ ation . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients should be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in the case of PCI patients with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , most of the hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages of arter@@ ial punc@@ ture occur in patients who undergo a per@@ ic@@ ular cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding occurs in principle all over the world .
in patients receiving War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is once again reached the level existing before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggregates ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggregates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ology parameters must be checked regularly in any case .
the animal experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , un@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ poll@@ uted He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area that required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , the use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding @-@ loc@@ ali@@ zations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din Group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately ab@@ ort and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ atic inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as to the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots .
binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , it was not possible to in@@ duce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ ol@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is confirmed by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
in the event that a PCI was performed following a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ en@@ apar@@ in was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were equally distributed over the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ took 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a per@@ ic@@ ular cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that as pep@@ tide , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as pep@@ tide enters into his amino acid components with subsequent re@@ utilization of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or can not process insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin colli@@ sions .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin sy@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin may be reduced in patients with reduced liver function .
any change of the effective strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method may result in a change in insulin delivery .
3 . insufficient doses or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effective profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is changed .
substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened under the effect of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic medicines such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin circul@@ ates in human breast milk , but generally , insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it absorbed by oral application .
listed below are the undes@@ irable drugs known from clinical studies , group@@ ed by system organ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive hun@@ - , head@@ aches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person or treated by a doctor with intraven@@ ous glucose .
after a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ al injection the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( in particular by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin resistance the effectiveness occurs faster and the effect is shorter than with the normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ li@@ on@@ tus , insulin lu@@ li@@ tis in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ ine effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ por@@ tional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ine effect , just like the human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ ine effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was clear that a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin sy@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
once Insul@@ ing@@ lu@@ li@@ sin was done 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
when insulin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin dosage in 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin intake in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison with human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
