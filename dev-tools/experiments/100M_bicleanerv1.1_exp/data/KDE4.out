package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , choose settings extensions .... Open the map card tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools Canc@@ ell@@ ation . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available .
the Posi@@ tioning Filter module ( also known as the folder filter ) can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Application Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed webpage . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this node node .
the Module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides an additional view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views so as to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to graphi@@ cally display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree @-@ map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; this reflects the size of a file or folder , specifying the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have useful color and labelling settings .
the colour of a rectangle , which is switched over View color mode , can either display depth for easy recognition of the depth or the representation of another file feature such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area of sub @-@ arranged rectang@@ les should be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rectangle .
in case of Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , it should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . it is drawn frame in order to show the ne@@ sting of entries , and this fr@@ ame@@ works need space , which is no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries .
how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames so that rectang@@ les arise that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive two .
you can set the minimal displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View to hold on an area . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or C@@ trl ; I .
when you call the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , which allows you to specify the image of the gallery .
the option Tit@@ le of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the Image per line option has a sli@@ der and a script to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
the box name of the picture shows whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
with the check box file size of the image , you specify whether the file size is displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails .
with the picture size check box , you determine if the size of the pictures is displayed in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved .
with the sub@@ folder check box , you can set the sub@@ folder with a sli@@ der or a rotating field to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
with the check box to copy original pictures , you specify whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
using the comment file check box you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the Custom color depth box , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; Edit ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , dozens of professional skills are available . it works completely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion with li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; through the camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; attempts to make reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the bug report system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would encourage you to join the user mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we will ask you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam site to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder here . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . this path is saved for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam , you will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . Set@@ ting Set@@ ting Set@@ ting Coll@@ ections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam , viewing every sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . during browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; dialog ; dur@@ ables recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub @-@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . this allows you to do exceptional &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; complete by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon .
once you &apos;ve configured the base folder , you can go to &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Cue List to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu .
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in the section Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfer over the serial port are slow , this connection is meanwhile ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview pictures from digi@@ ti@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to go to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes came &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the al@@ mine tree , above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window . the only restriction is that you cannot put a picture in words , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to emphasize the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter on the filen@@ ame works only if it is displayed on the symbol view . which fields can be displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was created first .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album Properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos if you select from the tool bar or sort albums sorted by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
the oldest , average , ne@@ sts buttons : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead .
when you open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be recycled .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
if you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this allows you to avoid using all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can customize the settings , change it . select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse @-@ cursor take a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the Intro@@ duction section of the main window displays such an auxiliary window .
photos are everything about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tags and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can reach all the functions that came with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ .@@ You can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the pictures .
you can open the picture editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... . in the Edit section ; picture editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
you can open a photo in another program by using the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing through other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the image may occur . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; dialog ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze it will be moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image deleted or Del . if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ cel@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam , using either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a cue is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ pi@@ quot ; collap@@ sing so that you can find the keywords that you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported when the database is lost once &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the pictures will be noticed .
you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keywords ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the option to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword , drag and drop . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview images and select from the context menu .
you can add a photo with an arbitrary number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have completed a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window while previ@@ ewing the image .
you can remove a keyword by using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove From the Tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords associated with the photo .
the time beam image shows a time @-@ adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame you just have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . this displays all the associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and more .
next he search box is a small lamp the green will find when the search hits . if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . after you have saved it , the filter appears in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the OK button and the search is performed . the results are displayed in My search list in the main window . the Text box Save as is used to select a name in my search list . if you want to change your search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Search , the form to enter the search appears with the search information previously entered . if you select Advanced search , the dialog for Advanced Search will appear to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete search from the context menu .
advanced Search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search options that you can search for in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group , or deleted from it . each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... . furthermore , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any image to find a similar . by means of a Schw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere along the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam . find the matching pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam , provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl + L to add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window will be opened . if you are again in &amp; digi@@ kam , the main window is , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Tools .
from the preview toolbar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you can select a preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the images , then these are also executed in the other image . you can compare the same area of both images .
another mode is better suited to quickly rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ate from a series of images . if you navigate for pairs from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas . the image on the right is displayed in the right pane . this simplifies to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file edit ....
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available in the lumin@@ aire for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan feature that you can see on the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the image , you have to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; both images will show the same image area in the preview mode .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and forth . this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos results in a form of digital asset management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure , find , protect and use your images . we focus on the process for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , convert , group , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content which has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is data that can provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need to find a certain photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . the approach to save the metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether other access to your photos should have , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive some@@ time .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location . the remaining photos will be organized several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will share sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements , e.g. version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the metadata entry page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ kam , provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an app@@ rais@@ al to each picture . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the further work .
let us now use keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata inter@@ s@@ ect . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata consists of many sections . filen@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to in@@ scrip@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you want to share your photos with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . w@@ ow ! you begin to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical time period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos , the title might be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive that you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) as let@@ tering . you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these let@@ tering will be exported to your wishes into the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels using pictures with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam , can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and design@@ ates practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam , as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this , in the picture . for private persons , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : plate error , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , dis@@ semination super@@ sti@@ tion
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated cau@@ tious and you can no longer trust them for a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; Dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and keep them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum@@ mation mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
slowly burn with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ eter format . then , read the data again to check you . likewise , please read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that media can read .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturing warran@@ ts include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks on this topic : disk failure study
the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s detected faults prec@@ ede the im@@ min@@ ent failure . this is particularly read errors and publishing counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also save data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electric devices don &apos;t matter much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and avoids the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember , however , that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . it guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the correctly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used on your computer , you should take care that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as also by this one over@@ voltage . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors who also have a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even an failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run down the system . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited storage , which should only be verified in reality .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are disaster safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these faults remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day will open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that use Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
you do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss of not@@ ebooks and 46 % on the work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the broad@@ est file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stop settings from fundamental physical limitations . this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss . so , backup your data frequently to a plan and test this backup before making any dangerous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make every day your backup on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , hit a flash you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft suspension : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous to your data . they usually affect a whole space or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Security : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made . this backup comes next with the exception that is only scanned and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only r@@ sync the difference of the files that were actually changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach lets you recover and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution might happen manually after you have made a complete review .

in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to wal@@ low as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have plan@@ ed the scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was recognized by the system but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ ad@@ c@@ 1 # modi@@ fies the size of the file if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier year @-@ to @-@ year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . however , it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can have relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed on the basis of the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology in 2001 to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , there may be problems when connecting the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format can occur . therefore , you should consider whether you are using D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI Working Groups , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ ct , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edited the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . these were then truncated by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them into web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the addition of a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ric indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application do not appear on the camera for any file , photos , movies , music etc .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata Metad@@ ata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam . please note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . downloading will not delete all photos from their camera and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have been downloaded until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you are using the Show all or download the selected folders , a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam , loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting all of them . if you want to delete only a few , you must first select them and then delete the selected delete option .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check whether the photos have been successfully downloaded from the camera before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera view@@ finder , you should do so via the camera menu as this is much faster .
cameras often don &apos;t use particularly meaningful names as filen@@ ames for the photos . this can lead to dup@@ licate filen@@ ames , if you load photos from different recording formats into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are done before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the Standard aut@@ ori@@ fi@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you prefer a different date format than standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y @-@ % Y % H : % M : % S in the editing area . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file names , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new filen@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ kam , for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata page , you can read more details about the information you embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ kam , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam can be used . these sub @-@ albums are based on the image data . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras will provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must to@@ ggle this option . use the Advanced button and select Dat@@ eline @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done &amp; digi@@ kam . you where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this refers to a position that is specified in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you forgot later , where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam , users who want to locate the location of the photo thus , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ or and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last through the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the signs of hair@@ y coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; dialog ; tries to give you as much control over its work procedures as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to edit the Edit menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . this allows you to set the default behavior of &amp; Edit ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even with a database synchronization these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author &apos;s title is syn@@ onymous with the author &apos;s title : this field should be the photographer &apos;s job title . this can be names like e.g. hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture to others &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ Fel@@ der@@ . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the &amp; digi@@ kam database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported can be imported without losing .
save images as embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions , from &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings by clicking the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire from &amp; digi@@ kam can be set on this page to the default values . however , when you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings are turned on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better view results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are defined here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling refers to the fact that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation .
with the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn on the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the setting Los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . at present , it is rapidly evolving into a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . default is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the sky@@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned in due to the inability of your camera to catch the peak lights as transparent white . to do this , use the setting through white in the settings . the setting colors creates some unusual results , as it shows the pointed @-@ lights in various rais@@ ins . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the lack of green and red portions from the un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which a matrix of colored pixels is available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ ming Design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w gives you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Variable Number of Gra@@ dient ) was used . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ ding gra@@ ding as you are carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam . information such as color information from one color space to the other can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Ask if a picture is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder S@@ ort the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam , this folder will examine them during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon that does not contain any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print image , because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could be corrected manually , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for . unfortunately not with the models from Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam can support many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Pre@@ ferences .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata into or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features on the left hand show a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can set the camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option Con@@ version dialog for moving &gt; Display pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can customize the dialog from &amp; digi@@ kam ; when you delete a photo in an album , you will find further details in the sections del@@ eting a photo and deletion of an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option Chan@@ ges in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ kam . under certain circumstances this will speed up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam .
setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam . you know if it is to delete them from the database .
various color schemes can be edited in &amp; dialog ; used to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings in Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Edit ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item Display / Edit .
the image processing includes a series of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting up the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . none of the features will however change the original photo before you have saved the file Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing from the File menu or using the Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save .
almost any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . you can und@@ o the last action by res@@ etting res@@ etting or re@@ covering by selecting Edit Res@@ et from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the return or restore button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be und@@ one or restored in between .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , down picture or the entries in the File menu . if you &apos;ve made any changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo and zoom out where you can use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in toolbar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change it in the dialog from &amp; digi@@ kam . you can view it from the Edit menu ; view the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single images or entire sentences . entire image preview pages can be printed out of your selection . you just have to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the Menu album Export Print Wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab makes the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible , which means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
with this button you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this will always be done if you have selected a metadata setting which is always written into the images .
the rating indicates a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency , which follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword .
if several images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a keyword to a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Date , keywords and searches . if one or more key words filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is set on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with Str@@ g + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword @-@ tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched on under Options Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have created and created a rule and find it to be one or more , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry you are looking for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of image processing work@@ flows . additionally , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image editions are via email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ll@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB . if you work as an RGB colour space , you either need to calibr@@ ate your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Comp@@ are and Con@@ tr@@ ast Exp@@ and from the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try to make the best of your colors . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the beam intensity values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ous intensity of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light borders and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the largest range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited to a color space of 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are therefore too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be customized in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original image again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the top right there is a hist@@ ogram shown that changes dynamically once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if any of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on the shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or di@@ mming down .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved into a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button re@@ stores all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings may result in another photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , comp@@ ut@@ ational time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult chapter Colour Management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under Col@@ ors Sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar radiation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that came into being when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash and then completed the development of the image . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to fine adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally generates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ a@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ via &apos;s highly saturated colours , however , are also a few photographs , especially those that have hardly any landscapes .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeat the thickness of the ne@@ on light . in case of large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can try to experiment the various color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you do a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you can perform can be previ@@ ewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma the tool is positioned to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complex , you need only the range of the sli@@ ders for the purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and shifted to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controls and make sure the picture changes .
on the right you can see the original and the preview of the image . the preview is updated dynamically using the image settings . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input parameters of the shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded picture as background while something else is to be seen in the background .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded again . to this end , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between linear and log@@ arith@@ mic views . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode is mostly the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become dark@@ er .
on the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if detected in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the Color channel mixer for image editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the colour for hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . when you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : control for red , green and construction permit you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the picture will retain the general brightness as well , because the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from color @-@ bre@@ wing . color @-@ bre@@ wing consists of small noise @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear differently in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance preserve is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene patterns and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves scen@@ eries , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ th@@ onite : creates warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ atter tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ ke@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ oc@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture in the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . continuous surround the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce den@@ oun@@ ds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , rounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any location . this also works at several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use@@ . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the bigger the image , the bigger the character set will be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply the tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation . however , you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam , please send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button &quot; base folder &quot; in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . selecting a folder will automatically update the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this knob decreases the image underneath . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you have to res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . to do so , take the image and position it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ educational . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a colour point . this in turn causes blur@@ red edges to be combined into a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharp@@ ness . images in raw format on the other hand must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a field of sharp@@ ness while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool suit . you can call this using the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ting sharpen@@ ing .
you should deal prud@@ ently , since the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . generally , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus it using the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ting . below re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the soft sign tool with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge is affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount is applied . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference with it to apply for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharpen@@ ing and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red blur@@ red was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected development filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtration . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular fold is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche fold has a very long tail , which leads to this the mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ el@@ es , which are far from the original pixels . the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular fold . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is extremely blur@@ red , but then pay attention to the icons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is incorrect . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value unlike zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the g@@ auss . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any more focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the tri@@ mming , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that a lot of operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible , but will leave unpleasant arti@@ facts later on .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp masks produce better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ ring mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp masks always have to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods for the correction of sharp@@ ness in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the smooth@@ ness regulator sets the sharp@@ ness of the area dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
level of detail p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform smo@@ othing over the image . whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and make details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ s evenly in all directions , while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD images , a high value will generate wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 is enough .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles create a long run @-@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal . it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected using small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact created during the journey . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on digital cameras sensor noise , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window Details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter is looking forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . you may need to re @-@ adjust the edges filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or s@@ mi@@ thing occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dark@@ er areas , which are typically more blur@@ ry , but also the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjusting of the phase j@@ itter atten@@ uation . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges . it can remove noise spi@@ kes and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting plas@@ tici@@ zers and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam , photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ act quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ en .
the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixels from photos that have been deleted with a CCD camera gem , eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem in high @-@ quality raw mode , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file to the wizard with the dark image . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you connect the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will detect the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and automatically re@@ charges it in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction using a color photo from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not light the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting &amp; quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes the necessary sh@@ utter speed so high that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses , also with Center filters , should use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise ir@@ regul@@ arities are caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ing ranges of today &apos;s film and color or gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction removes the transformation with a Center@@ filter . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three controls you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of maximum density . the standard density is 2,0 , which compens@@ ates an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . reduce the density by a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree to compensate .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want fin@@ er real@@ ignment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu ; picture editing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a Leu@@ ch@@ stär@@ ke@@ - and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth gra@@ ding correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two you can almost eliminate any geometric distortion .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the inver@@ ted parameter of the parameter General .
zoom : this value scales the image size and results in a correction of first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the tone or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tone @-@ like correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the t@@ ine / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ ers blan@@ king from image editing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog .
for most images , the tone @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area to preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Show movie kern@@ els if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) to be seen . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ened from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photo , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you need to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the standard value is , although frequently higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film particle effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smo@@ othing controls the smo@@ othing or , viewed from the other side , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage sketch . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to outline you .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob adju@@ sts the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter Grav@@ ity shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stack@@ ed in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter Grav@@ ure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important one . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving fil@@ ter@@ . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wavel@@ eng@@ ths 2 : analog@@ ous to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time by pressing the exit button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Zoom : blur@@ red the image along star shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ b the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ utter blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by means of random displacement of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ b it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the picture into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button Be@@ en .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives your images a wet look . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm inspired by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can do with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing an area free of rain@@ drops . to do so , use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . you can find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ers Tur@@ ning or transforming Refl@@ ection .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information again ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size change in menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the size tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing .
many image editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo blown was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below :
maintaining the aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ on@@ ess for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast in what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ en .
you can see below an example of photo blown by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison .
the cro@@ pping of a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows this very easy . to cut a photo you just have to create the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rectangle . you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rectangle . you can drag a new rectangle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button for image editing in the toolbar and the photo is tri@@ mmed ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the File Save or Save File menu item in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the higher value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned .
cutting the tool by aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
below in dialog you can use the Max . relation button to set the area for cutting to the wid@@ est possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are saved as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help make it possible to show help so that you can better put your images together . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmonic divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ eb@@ re@@ ins , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rectangle with a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division that relies on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have been using the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos to achieve . compared to the 3rd el@@ re@@ gel , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s view along the line of the spiral and creates on this way a sym@@ metric visual flow .
another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to make the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that , in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , gold tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diagonal on these lines can be published a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve differently .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
if you do a photo then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; picture editing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . by button Pre@@ ferences , you can set the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you shot an image , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers blan@@ king out of image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automati@@ cally tri@@ mming function . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smo@@ othing the picture a bit after rotation . note however the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically comp@@ uted . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new Wid@@ th : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels .
angle to the top left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle Left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the image will be a little lubric@@ ated . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformation tri@@ mming from the image processing .
a horizontal she@@ ar for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rectangle turns into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via Transform@@ ers scissors .
drag your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can shoot horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single shot , this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two insul@@ ations make twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation tri@@ mming from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; dialog ; shows only files in formats that know . this happens based on the file extension and a comparison of it with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam . please refer to the configuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . thereby , redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the &amp; digi@@ kam raw image converter ; see the configuration section for more information on how modules are used with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam , support loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . hereby more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the Dave Coff@@ in web page . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editor and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program for playback .

if you swa@@ p steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can do the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam . your description will follow here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applying quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to display over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module will be noted .
the Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is shown as a line in the Pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the Pal@@ let view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m cursor is activated under the color button , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written by another ; depending on whether the over@@ write mode has been selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for clip@@ board data : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a line @-@ end character , if there are three values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
graph@@ s are used in science , particularly in computer science . graph@@ s are used in science , particularly in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that are &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; included , are according to the program author ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ inter ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph is re @-@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; represented )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from around 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to present more than this node )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graph pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . required in detail :
the main window displays the open graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later also will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can configure the menu item Settings k@@ graph@@ viewer ; set ... , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , and in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
with the program start you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page are to be fitted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ s distributed across multiple pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Shop page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can specify a default behavior in this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( the files of the last session open or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which normally appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z website , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated graph@@ s . it produces images according to the spr@@ ing@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm produces a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for un@@ eri@@ ved graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man pure gold he@@ ur@@ istic , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the node circular according to the description of Six und Tol@@ li , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph file as a parameter , and give the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify special options , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
specifies the type of graph ( aimed or ung@@ eri@@ fied ) and turns the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ s ) .
if this option is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further help to this element ( if any ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module includes tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default values duc@@ r@@ he in order to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed .
after you have cli@@ cked the button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the Import &gt; Screen photo ... menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have picked up the complete desktop , only the window is read in the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog box appears with the options described above .

if you change the option Chan@@ ges the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered in Maximum Size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Gallery Export Module is a tool for ex@@ porting your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery export now has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please contact the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF key words of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ alizing pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to perform a possible correlation between time and location , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file naturally contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera zone . if the deviation is below the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have matching dates . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog shows the coordinates of a call to the next one you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do this , select the region concerned and increase si@@ e.@@ Run this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ ool uses to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the Choice allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the tab defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you select the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth , which naturally affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nails allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are shown in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred while generating . the web browser will automatically be started at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found , for example , in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation at this moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please contact the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all picture formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoder module is a tool for converting a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic picture transition . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player .
first you have to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , high , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be adjusted next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the m@@ peg file . keep in mind the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings according to your wishes , you can use the Ko@@ de button to start the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or easily enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button at the bottom right .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for that .
Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , retains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the star@@ code and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image . for this purpose four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to customize your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional scale in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . more images can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent .
after you started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more pictures using the button Images . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the New message window of your email client with the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are already attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to send . it may be possible to send a good idea to multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
the PNG format in the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you to JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the Advanced Sli@@ deshow module , a window with questions like your slideshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by means of Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the filen@@ ame option ensures that the file name of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
between the images , the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance , however , depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should test it before you show your friends !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , every transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on you .
with this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please contact the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries present .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are shown on which both persons can be seen . by using this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown in a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action .
each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to locations , keywords and other categories you have defined .
to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your words ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you must select the image @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and select the corresponding person in the context menu . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
when you call the Find Find dialog in the main window , a dialog is displayed which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture .
if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be searched for that text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals but rather want to try some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo when you start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then , some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , please refer to the &amp; k@@ photo@@ album homepage ; as a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview pane from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture will display this date in the preview window ) and also the time line always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview window .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps . if you select an area , you will see in the preview screen only pictures of that time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described , which you can create through the File menu ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and destination . in the following each section is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the survi@@ ving and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file that is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information displayed to the viewer without description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; at the moment all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more pictures , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so you can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if he wants to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , set the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to specify the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created is started . otherwise , the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . so the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will set you in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you may want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you need to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do once again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files are searched . this is , of course , only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file by means of HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can export through the Export ... menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the Manual option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to import ( if you are a domain ) while this category is called by your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the file to be im@@ porting and which categories match them in your database .
in the fourth step you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . you can see an example of this in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; for example , if you see pictures of your holiday trip and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Speci@@ fying the information about your images , about ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal Backup tools , to a dis@@ kette or re@@ visions in the CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your images are stored and automatically re@@ stores it with future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; i.e. , another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the next section of the user manual , you will explain the various settings options .
on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view the preview options and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the Options section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up entire member groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in this section .
in the list box above you can select the category you want to configure . in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
modules can be called via the Module menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access through the module itself .
since the modules are shared by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before you use them on your own images . demo database can be used either via command line with the &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications do not support their images in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
simul@@ ating &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all images that you can see at the moment .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so whether you would have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select which modules to load .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are familiar with it from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and a tool bar at the top . at the moment , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but click on the pictures below to show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
here you can see three lists with a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are pic@@ tured , you can find that the names used are moved upwards to find and assign persons more quickly .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sort by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click the above and back buttons below the picture to the right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these images and to use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a sub @-@ group . to show you that this is a sub @-@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can easily drag an entry into a category and place it there to make it an sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and drag@@ ging the bar that forms the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to view this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the Show images in your browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be found here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can also use pictures without having saved you on the hard disk . of course , you need to have the images stored somewhere to record &amp; photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , where the right upper corner is cut , are not saved on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present ; however , you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , it does not support you to ask for the inser@@ ting of the CD concerned . so , if you want to avoid anger , like the m@@ ess of your images , please buy a larger hard disk to store all images on it .
in the pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , simply filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible to others and click Instant view in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister can see and bar the menu item All except up @-@ to @-@ date view .
with this you have defined which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again shown , click on the lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand all images on the hard drive and on the other , anyone can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml to read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only to forbi@@ d those who with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to look at private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to view them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using a picture _ and video viewer . these can be started from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered into the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is available at all . all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image above and below image . you can jump to the first and final image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it can load a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can zoom in and zoom in . to zoom in , you can simply move a rectangle with the mouse . with the minus key you can zoom out The Plus key zo@@ oms in in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key , the zo@@ oms function , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos show in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the rotary functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make ann@@ ot@@ ations to the current image using the menu item Notes from the context menu .
when you view images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can cancel the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you might prefer to preview only the picture and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in the picture you see an image with characteristics A , B and C .
once you have set characteristics on your images , they are available to you in the browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply complete all of them at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you can display categories in the special preview , then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you allow &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in order to switch on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; do not fully master , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press on thumb@@ nail preview and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub @-@ arranged element . if you want to render only a part of the texture ( e.g. a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , check out local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level of the scene selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also save multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or under one view , pull the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , pull the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , pull the beginner on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left at the beginning bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the beginning bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can be saved with View Window arrangement ... Save . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 is up @-@ to @-@ date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View Sc@@ ene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View R@@ ender mode ... the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can type any name , but useful is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the cross section sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in combination @-@ field quality you can select the properties that use &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard , an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling covers the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adap@@ tiv @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively because every pixel is split and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ord@@ able depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel passes the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further tra@@ cked and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for rendering quality is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent then if the associated beams have not hit any object .
opens a new window to display the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import the scene , select the Import menu file ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click help in the property view , click &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object capture of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you cross High degree of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections . this property results in a better approxim@@ ation for the projections , but requires more time to render .
when you view a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . in the section R@@ ender modes you can find exact details on the parameters .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section , explains how to create and store window orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation box Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button .
the new window . with New Col@@ umn , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ ored the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ ored the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have straight &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : one ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . especially note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply button or the Enter key , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a j@@ ader ( insert infinite body cross@@ fa@@ der ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model @-@ view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look closely at the object tree , you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to the exercise a unit below the h@@ oriz@@ ons , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , where you can select how to insert the object . please choose the first item . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the preview button see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment is just a matte black material because you need to enter the settings for the pigment yet . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on the preview . also , there are many options now , but now take the simplest one .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the box and the ball in the preview , click on the Apply button and then go to the preview .
the material for the floor is now properly set . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you have expected . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called one color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree every time you select and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to execute this step because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should already have understood the ball as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button ) so that the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now makes a wei@@ rd result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matte black material . in the following step , set up a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the settings of gloss effect and reflection sometimes result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal is not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoot hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray reflects and breaks through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ produces the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ted command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Res@@ in .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . with this option you can add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands .
a B@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface , without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic geomet@@ ries are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these bas@@ kets . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s button or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a particular file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialog Configuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; flash@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start @-@ up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is also filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; D@@ exter@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed that can display the program as well .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time interval between the image change in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlar@@ ges the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
show the picture in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the filen@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ shot ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam site ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means that the user will contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ shot ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry Reports you problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ shot ; then we want to encourage you to join the user mailing list of &amp; show@@ shot ; and hopefully soon answer any questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to join &amp; show@@ shot ; to participate , it &apos;s the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ shot ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as you can . there are many options that can change the behavior of &amp; show@@ shot ; to access these settings , you must select show@@ c@@ ture in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . Sk@@ ills should display the colors with what you want to display . exposure should display a light color and exposure to a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ shot ; features a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in picture editing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer can scan and save as images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer can scan and save as images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to save each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can first start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if a preview is displayed in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when de@@ pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of each scanned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save File option without asking for a filen@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it by button ... .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the suggested name for the image in dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is uploaded each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; used under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up the global keyboard short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking into the player window and setting up Global button short@@ cuts . the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; specific keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and setting short@@ cut commands ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of the collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
start require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can replace data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . to this end , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Soft the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started Amar@@ ok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signi@@ fies that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions to query more information about the new piece ( such as metadata or piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume ensures a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contain the path to the selected files in the playlist , when a user defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , clearing up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user and z@@ b have downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as e.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ o@@ ks script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the ex@@ iting amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is complete , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re also looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search will find you the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart playlist automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to hear your music . these and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies have to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
activate Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
when the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this modi@@ fies the color scheme for the tun@@ er bar@@ ometer .
add voice files to the music files : this feature is only available when compiled and Amar@@ ok ; if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files will be saved ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece change visible , that the play@@ lists window will roll up / un@@ roll in order to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
when changing the piece to the context browser , automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can customize it &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the Fon@@ ts section , you can specify the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn Fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Choice of Custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection activated below for foreground and background color .
resume playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback with the piece in the place with which it was stopped at the last exit .
the on @-@ screen display setup allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the display text field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space brackets , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , which allows you to determine which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the Audio Output Card lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate other setting options in this card .
the flash@@ card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up as to the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub @-@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : enable &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser later .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination panel driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : will the machine enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the load card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and refresh the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok requires only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will , for example , cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by going to ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file causing the crash .
mostly this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure that all libraries of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate automatically . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open during a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information , but they are not lab@@ elled as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repeat / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects will simply be forgotten . this can be done in the Control Center under App@@ ear@@ ance Symbols . note that in some cases , you need to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting has its effect .
if you get this error : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct q@@ t library .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first .
there are some ways . most installation problems are best explained by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the Channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please note that there is only one error , if something is due to the correction of an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to review pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the Sh@@ ort@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the button can be saved . click on it .
probably missing the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be : which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in the default do not include MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio at the same time . this can be achieved by using a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ tization ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that car@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you well .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ f _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less beams respond the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all components . register the registry and register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with follow @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report this to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set up an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm perform this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok multi@@ player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;ll be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music you &apos;ve stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles running on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usability bin Amar@@ ok player now@@ pl@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your user name with your user name . this assumes your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button displays a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what is now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to link to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . a file browser opens with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , use files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically , this adju@@ sts the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can add the rating for a piece by right clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then , you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
developers do not want to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publishing plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when you play anim@@ ate in the general settings .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports are caused .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound@@ card with Amar@@ ok ?
setting Amar@@ ok Settings ... Add audio output to the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts is not taken care of . of course , you are welcome to take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed tut@@ or for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide should be a help . with its help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection facilitates the search for certain pieces . if you are content with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button Play@@ list . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . when the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . a file browser opens with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you will also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; It offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any regular multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important features . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else . the Play@@ list window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; including the creation of a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream . just below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sample rate of the current piece . a click on this section changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fiable window .
the PL and E@@ Q button can also be found under the scroll bar . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece posi@@ tional sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start playing / stop and switch to the next or previous piece .
the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pre @-@ settings .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use the Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you select the equ@@ ali@@ zer box , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the wealth of features they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be split into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist itself is easy to use , yet even for advanced users .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser styles . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub @-@ windows will be explained in detail later .
if you have already used previous versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; perhaps you may notice that the sub@@ window is dropped off . the information shown there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistical window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window shows information about the currently running piece as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browsers will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can specify which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you don &apos;t have a text script yet , you can choose which one to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required to do this .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing artist - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces will be arranged according to artist and below will be a further division after the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent Interpre@@ ters .
group Artist / Year - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by one another . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings for the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ record your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . you can find hints to use this filter in the section on the playlist in this manual .
the search filter contains a selection box that allows you to filter the recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours to one year . in addition , you can of course select your entire collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to playlist - Att@@ ach the selected pieces of the current playlist . double click on an entry to reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this way you will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the waiting queue for transmission to the media player . see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark it as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among various interpre@@ ters .
high@@ lighting up selection - Modi@@ fy the album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . after that the album is no longer displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the playlist browser makes handling many play@@ lists very easy , including smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . this uses &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be included before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , find the pieces on your iPod according to artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the required tracks from the playlist and drop them to the Artist list . when you &apos;re done , click Apply . this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the commit is finished , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you find a address bar with which you can pick music from a given URL . if you enter the example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter key , you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping the Shift key . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful . in this case , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms with spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
when you enter OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that Mike Old@@ field does not include , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you would like to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign prior to the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants as you wish . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that include either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can set the sequence of records by holding the C@@ trl key pressed , and then right @-@ click on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist . to the right of it , you will find play@@ lists , Emp@@ ty Play@@ lists and Rand@@ om Mixer .
next , the buttons will follow the und@@ o and restore buttons . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set to the analy@@ zer by clicking the right mouse button .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you want to display in the player window over the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example , playback control and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and setting up Tool@@ bars there ... select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and repeat play can be changed easily by double clicking with the mouse in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar flag in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . via this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
click on this entry to open the Visu@@ alization Plugins window . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry you find a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big move into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ set ( the details to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window , or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pres@@ et modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists Mix instantly popul@@ ate your playlist and you can start playing directly . the recommended pieces will start with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next unit change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated .
the New button re@@ fills the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and no play will be played in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while listening to the songs .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists that have been crossed .
some scripts make your own settings possible . you can customize the settings by bo@@ oting the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking the script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on how to write your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plugin is used to enable the available visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you can create an audio CD . to track the steps you need to have a run @-@ up installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , remember that when you re @-@ code to MP3 , you can get worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have put the source @-@ CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , CD Copy ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible burning settings .
after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please click the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as reading the original into the image file is complete , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ ppers .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio coding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis deco@@ ders and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : more libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , it is possible , for example , to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ Ma@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . click on an entry to open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new filen@@ ame .
save the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown to allow you to select folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call file Save for each project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what should happen , just as if you have called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can view the files and folders already available on the medium .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
it also allows you to create only one copy of a DVD , which you can then burn some@@ time later . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the submitted media . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is ti@@ cked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Table of Cont@@ ents allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header does not have any real function , it looks pretty and separates the projection screen from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard mapping to the bottom .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator privileges are required , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ising and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of your task will be decisive , which of the accompanying programs will give you den@@ sely .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ string parent ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ders that enco@@ de these WAV files ( comp@@ ressing ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( these enco@@ ders have to be added from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have to be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions but it is probably not necessary to install some of them yourself .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer provides a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog has to be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily use to read a &amp; CD is explained later on . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , all of which is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if an En@@ co@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default . it must be noted that before the En@@ co@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , be@@ eps ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; quit ) .
opens the main Configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , for setting the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such &apos; shor@@ ts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play devices is present .
MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto hi @-@ fi systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate app 5.5 . always needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate app . 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by you@@ ths , portable devices and auto accessories . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; add title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information , so that all others can download this information instead of itself into the computer . it &apos;s worth not@@ ing that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal but I ( editor &apos;s note : with this the author is meant ) am not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being hurt by the &amp; CD ; there is also information without the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway by a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator , actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio creator is set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirr@@ oring server will be needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening are predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab itself .
the encoder package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined encoder . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer is available in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; to do so , check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; read l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine because it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is / usr / share / cd and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy it into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; audio creator ; something that is probably done only once , and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each broadcast &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to change them during each read@@ out of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name will be passed to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card list General Settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information is missing to generate keywords ( tags ) .
the map menu CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during the reading of the &amp; CD .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately begins reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filen@@ ame or tag entries resulting from it . the directory and file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; tags and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org side and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously missing pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , so simply try themselves .
after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is on average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags may also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each depar@@ ting &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data cleared for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of fet@@ ching them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; can be identified as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then search the Questions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully obtained from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are filled in and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there , a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that is best suited to your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current titles &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the comment field of the album can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. all words with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the issuing CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off . make sure all pieces are selected or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
if you click on the selection button to read the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the toolbar buttons .
this is the window to control jobs . the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error oc@@ cured right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in the case of weak machines , the result is unclear . the used computer with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of course two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is maintained today within the k@@ de ; CVS is maintained as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you are reading this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map flash@@ cards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still to read ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any reference point like it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot keep this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; may it do . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts as well as some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US maps . al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the process used .
session Support . when you stop playing a song while playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will appear the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button on the toolbar , select the play from the play menu or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you click it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as you play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two functions : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item pause in the play menu , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text , others use lyrics , and some other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so you don &apos;t need to manually adjust the text . so , if you select the Automati@@ cal Text option in the Settings menu , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type fixed , select text events and / or property events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these are played back in series . in this section you can see how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , open the Collection Manager first . you can find it in the menu item under the item Organ@@ izing .... Click here to New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then giving the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember , if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you need to be selected in the Collection Manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu Coll@@ ections , the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it from the Collection Manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button For@@ mer piece , the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow left arrow .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter because it is not stored when you leave &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of Change patch to B@@ right Piano in the event of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all GM sound cards are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US maps , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A further key map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches from General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so do not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard , for example , does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( g@@ amm@@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch refers to where each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how notes are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument .
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several ke@@ yp@@ ads for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used primarily to map notes on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and the second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map with the name name is used for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der ratio value indicates in what ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ ayed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard that gets a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards are trying to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a complete set of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played right now .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view in the Settings menu under the item channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
so , for example , if you find a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files separately .
OK , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first of all , enable Automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop open &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection , turn on the Automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ Q. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have a lot of spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
they really make me happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will get in contact with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid , written entirely in my spare time and I don &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to stress that I only need to continue programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ash@@ i I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten W@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks go to all these excellent musicians on the web that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM instrument or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it works as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not listen to any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ MB ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category persistent playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . when you click an entry , the group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can do this only if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ players / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you need to select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; S@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
animation during start and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ last option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml ; the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . however , this would be bo@@ ther@@ some in the end animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of your favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ correctly &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; In directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; KM@@ players .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of S@@ MB . this is where the output of m@@ player is visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , such as setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignment of K@@ DE .
kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ MB ; can be started in a console application and searched for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; S@@ MB ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to get a given back@@ end for a particular Mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) Settings in the S@@ MB , the dialog can be used in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the code to use must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of S@@ MB only can use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , various names are used by S@@ MB for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom will be run as user root after binding the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure / dev / c@@ drom drives to the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time ?
note : the response is over@@ hau@@ l@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ iling &amp; ti@@ pping ;
latex ; : a professional typ@@ ef@@ ace application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be res@@ or@@ ted to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be included ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box should be established .
if questions arise or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking ; on or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn its options , the manual can be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly there with reading the chapter .
for &amp; latex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( close ) &amp; latex ; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview on &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be able to master properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other recording languages contains &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the most common properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ ati@@ fication are specified as well as a body with text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ &apos; begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : hereby , the type of document to be created is : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : hereby the encoding of the system is set . modern systems are increasingly using U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex ; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used when preparing German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it &apos;s just a short description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you are seeing gr@@ asp@@ berry areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed .
with the automatic fail@@ over of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ beginning { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line to lock the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu Set@@ ting ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the most common and the most subtle element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when creating a DVI ; file &#91; right @-@ dependent file &#93; &#93; , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is besides PDF the standard output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the image search , the elements of DVI ; file with the editor are plu@@ cked and once cli@@ cked to an element in the DVI ; the pre @-@ search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex ; source code has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is j@@ umped .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
video Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is based on ther@@ mo @-@ n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â and it does not call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction .
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be displayed . the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick outline of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ instructions for sub@@ division are :
the selection box Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting items such as Tags , notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : this command creates a description for a section , a picture or a different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( selection above a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is hung to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files may also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ ss is used for determining the font size . it enables the font Ã © s for the main text , the notes notes etc . the following fonts are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and placing the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above source code sample has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the button quick construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; for storing automatically .
if the document is not comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . when using Quick Construction , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( close environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows for the change of the fonts in the environment .
changes are only considered within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , there may be certain fonts , bold print , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
the background for writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language is now followed by a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text is entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . to do this , there should be a quote , a few passages in the fat and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it and have fun .
DVI ; is a constant file format ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; source text has been created , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the search option allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . you just need to set up Modern under Settings box ...
in order to select the preferred search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked to pre @-@ search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then done so@@ then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Statement by &amp; Ki@@ le ; Open and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . for this , &amp; box ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( Set@@ ting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if you do not open the &amp; DVI connection , a bug is available . if an error is present , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file will explain the source code in the source text . in the editor , the buttons can be used for pro@@ verb@@ s between errors . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the error line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the defective line .
once the button is cli@@ cked on the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to use for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from the ground up or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document . more information on this can be found in the section .
high @-@ income users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by pressing an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , you can choose your own template rather than the default one .
a template can be created from any and latex ; files created in an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described in the following steps .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its options , the manual can be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly with the reading of the chapter .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double click with a pressed C@@ trl key to select the word &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par with \ \ par \ \ \ big@@ skip , only \ \ par will be selected .
when drag@@ ging the text with the left mouse button pressed , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jump tok@@ ens . this is a special type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items Edit kl@@ springs or the corresponding button keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jumping record , so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent possibilities offered , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code has been added ; special commands for selection . under Edit Settings , the following commands for text selection are included :
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with consistent lines ( like in other text editors ) . this extended meaning closes with tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bent thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a round line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; C@@ ate ; provides the keyboard short@@ cuts C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; C@@ ate ; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Remove the following commands to delete the text :
del@@ etes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le provides ; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment .
if the cursor happens before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , the cursor is j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the view over can quickly be lost . this command closes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure is not distorted .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special orders for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those of Edit environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command we jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the bra@@ ces of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , the cursor is j@@ umped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted pair @-@ bra@@ ces , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not distorted .
in &amp; latex ; two simple quotation marks are used as guest feeds . for the pur@@ pos@@ eful implementation , the sign is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign is used for two simple quote characters . also for the end of the quote , the sign is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and has two conclu@@ ding quotation marks for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic insertion of double quotation marks can be set up in Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. german or french ) and thus German or French quotation marks . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item .
within a spread@@ sheet environment , t &amp; Ki@@ le closes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ associated with a subsequent line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set up under settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line . even though this tab is not the one added , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) still extended . three of these work on demand and the other two are set for automatic adjustment . all of these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings box ...
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the button , the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to gr@@ ate the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , von &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jumping nets can be inserted , so that a jump to these positions can be possible by editing jump brands N@@ Ã ¤ th trampoline and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete , settings can be made to these lists . there can be different lists of wishes for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as wi@@ dening of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin , and the call of the complete dig@@ ging mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of the environments .
when calling the full disk space above the menu item Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment automatically is opened and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient comprehen@@ sion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is closed automatically . as soon as &amp; Ki@@ le sees it is a list environment , a first \ \ item command is even added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete , settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of termination mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of cuts , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under settings box ... and can be set up fully . as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is used , for example , the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word Processing Mode is introduced over the menu Edit Batch Con@@ version or C@@ trl + Alt Space key , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large @-@ scale break@@ ers are not helpful for automatic processing . however , it has been found that many users in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written users .
this mode can be set up in the menu box ... Ki@@ le can be disabled completely . here , too , the threshold value can be set for the display of the completion .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen Home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be followed and followed .
PS files are not as familiar as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to view the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus , compilation , converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the subsequent conversion can be used the keyboard key Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by Alt ; 4 using the old ; 4 the PS file .
when using the Quick structure command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window is opened each time .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
when rolling the filen@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a large number of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different tools to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . it contains documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
a complete Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its e@@ â like Fre@@ in@@ de@@ â . it is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; it is not always easy to find the right document . as a possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the documents and boxes ; provided documents and herein a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or tags . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; working area environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all use under observ@@ ance of the &amp; GNU ; license .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . with the command line interface you create random signature or time signature from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signature signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . due to many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day use with it different signatures , as with the random signature you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click with the &amp; lt ; blank signature ; and in the bottom section enter your new signature . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails private or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross on the toolbar .
to change a short command , select an action from the list . then , click the Custom button at the bottom right of the button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ ies ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 is required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all of these tools use com@@ m as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my@@ pro@@ c and how superior it is . if we raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal , simply cli@@ cked on the symbol for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the desired working folder , then leave the current working folder attached . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current job folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is flaw@@ ed . please check the reported error and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then the current file is simply checked . if not , delete the tick in the current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the Well @-@ formed review selection .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed by the other file file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug@@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start editing plug@@ ins to the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several individuals in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and serves to uniqu@@ ely identify .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold after which you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can be an event for information sent to the team leader when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing the project so that later you can see how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that initi@@ ates a file to the CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter notes is simple . either the note entry from the editor context menu can be selected or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , where nick@@ name is the assigned nick@@ name of the team member , is part of the project from the following possibilities : the respective area or sub @-@ project names should be given as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it . the entries are :
large / lower case of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / Small writing of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lower@@ case means that the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically lock : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags .
automatically update the start and end tag : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here will be st@@ alled from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
default D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting here will be st@@ alled from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly , so that the document can be recovered from this backup in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . also for un@@ saved documents , backup is generated regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in its own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and dock / app@@ end views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message section serves to control the display of warnings by enabling no longer promp@@ ting .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the illustration of the par@@ ser nodes in the document can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ ture Tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree in the editing and how deeply to change the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , the most well known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; Only @-@ Read mode &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ parts refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the entered information is correct . un@@ select allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations across plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it shares the plugin with , to listen to de@@ bug claims . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if it happens before a request is made , the execution begins once a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible with functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help get better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / etc . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbol orient@@ ated strips of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user may ever have .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see for details to convert .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day displays . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow quick inser@@ ting tags into a document without danger of a type@@ writer .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in an easy way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than the element type itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the Type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a merely element type element .
this element can only be used once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc . this is a merely element type element .
specifies the source code used to fill in the attributes in tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that brings together the elements of a list . it can only happen once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
sets the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( i.e. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a merely element type .
specifies a list of elements that termin@@ ate a tag . this element is a merely element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ained and closed properly .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , particularly in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and review Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a more dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filen@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; loading function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor , accessible via D@@ TD Edit D@@ TD settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings ... . click New Action to open the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered into the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file will be removed : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is added unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the exported application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , directed to the standard output ; error messages , to the default output output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the output written on the standard output by setting the input field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a separate toolbar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure promotions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
complete all required fields and add the tag to the right toolbar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and plan their use , enable &quot; Edit the Tag &quot; when available so that it is possible to input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green most of the time will be interpreted as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least send a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the toolbar setting dialog by Settings Tool@@ bars . make sure the toolbar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to preview the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all symbols to ensure everything works .
back up in the correct folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it is created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar ( s ) is loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . first , let &apos;s let you know the second one we treat here .
# K@@ DE Configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index Top element = your description for this documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html sec@@ 2.@@ = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1 html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2 html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of doc@@ r@@ c file intended for designing context sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation should be displayed for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separated contex@@ tual elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps .
if you are sure that this is good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you won &apos;t be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the disk resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places there is an email @-@ menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . to make a contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this guarantees the origin of resources , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , up@@ loading tool@@ bars , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installing , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be cancelled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD menu and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that should appear in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , adds &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and to take full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to be able to draw , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to back up different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which allows common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the card holders with information and the tool bar . please check in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all tab , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the Editor area to add a context menu to the edited document content , such as edit / copy / paste , edit the tags in the mouse poin@@ ter , help to the word under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string under the mouse poin@@ ter is a file .
at the top of the editor window are the tools of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is displayed as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of toolbar is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the symbol representing the tag . now , you can insert the data for this precisely inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate , open and ro@@ am information in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . in the representation with index tabs , for files , projects , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views are available .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view displays all files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category hangs from the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of breakdown in global , local and project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the right mouse button further functions are available , such as starting the script , editing or sending an email .
with this view you display the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the application @-@ oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab displays all error in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options to pass to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what has been developed by someone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only allowed users and developers to expand and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or help k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on templates . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converted when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ Note that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ Note which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of the scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
turning and switching the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the column column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a single click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents will be group@@ ed in the menu based on the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or Project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar , which only creates the name . actions must be saved by means of Settings ... or you will be asked when you are asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; anyone who has made you or someone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD are to be refres@@ hed without updating the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , in the Tags menu , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using a tool bar den@@ ies when this day is contradic@@ ting the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed in the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plugin to disable it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the current version .
choose the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may need time or create un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended to use the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the main window is switched on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
sets the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and change the row sequences .
this should create a help in the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift + F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have a static web content that you want to download and modify . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
be linked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be mounted . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the box , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree menu in the sub@@ window profile or changed using the Shift + F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signal are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information on Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by clicking its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was open .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the Project icon Open Project from the Tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
various profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is hidden to prevent removal .
the password is kept in the kernel memory and forgotten by BAE . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is needed and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; lots of upload profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your spru@@ ce , this is either a time @-@ saving feature or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password will be stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened , opened or deleted from the Project Tool@@ bar Menu Project or Project Tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your own way of working .
as mentioned above , toolbar buttons are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is best to customize using the Tool@@ bar menu . use and add differ . adding tool bar is handled in the bottom section of the Add tool bar section .
the toolbar and the icons can be set either using the context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the toolbar ) in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar can be removed , toolbar icons , or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be displayed in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up Tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and set Settings ... set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are stored in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate manner to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find it all , from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or per@@ l . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As a template Save As a local template ....
once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template Save as a local / project template Save as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drag@@ ged and dropped onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for example drag@@ ging and dropping or inser@@ ting over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project files you can click a folder on the right and select site template to enter a name for the template and backup . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can submit he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically using &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them to them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set a folder &apos;s behavior in the template list with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set up , it would basically disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , one probably is in a root folder .
allows pre@@ ordered or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to furnis@@ h a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , using the context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) , you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor that can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL editor .
the V@@ PL editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor . then you can edit and turn back to the source editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is active , this mode is already active , the key pressure puts the active cursor from one window to the other , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization gap between the V@@ PL editor and the source text editor can be set via the Qu@@ anta setting . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the web page so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called once a new document is created with the V@@ PL editor . this is used to reduce the manual encoding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list makes it possible to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to integrate an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
using the cursor is possible like in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor is peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting using a button or distance button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the T@@ ables Assistant or the Li@@ sts Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for checking style sheets . unlike other sty@@ les@@ he@@ et programs , searching for specific elements is possible and the style template design can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to compile successfully , except for &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a filen@@ ame without path . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded sample file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire match is checked with a pre@@ age named QNAP &apos;s or a given name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP entity that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNA@@ P@@ ME &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file , x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a rag@@ ged holding point has to be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

with the installed Re@@ ad@@ line library you can scroll with the arrow keys on / off by the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

filen@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ Win systems , the name must have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems .
path : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had a lot of text in the same file .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what changed exactly within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows enables resol@@ ving conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to synchron@@ ize and merge entire folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; for folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and le@@ aning against the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other one differs in a line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease typing by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example :
folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder folder folder 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the opening dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog shows your selection and displays it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
via the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filen@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately set up an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison then begins immediately . in the open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now , you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and dropping of text into another program as tri@@ mming and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is well to see in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
when differences have been found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the abstra@@ cts column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . when the line breaks are enabled , the line is shown on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription Edition : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; changing &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains already text by automatically mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the jumps to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference must also be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . this group then becomes the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merge or manual work ; no line is left in the queue ; this is only a wild@@ card for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and copy elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignore options or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate primarily with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , up , end , C@@ trl @-@ beginning and C@@ trl key , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
you can also use the other buttons for editing in the display window . with the Pa@@ ste button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
clicking with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ picture up / C@@ trl @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . note that all non @-@ automatically solved conflicts continue to be considered as conflict . therefore , between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you must press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is checked , whatever you mark , will automatically copy to the clip@@ board and the manual copy is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix versions use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + new@@ line files \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start .
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width for selection , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered stream@@ lined . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ regulated color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is checked , each selection will be copied automatically to the clip@@ board .
you can choose which new@@ line type you prefer for saving . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . also when mer@@ ging , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only store a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , the cart return characters may be visible , but like a white character .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated as white signs .
this option is disabled in the default setting . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensively searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in auto @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is j@@ umped .
resol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the mer@@ ging menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging for details .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be added to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for the encoding a short note appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress any changes in white characters in text or view columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color@@ fully coded ke@@ yp@@ ad column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . by choosing A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal yet another over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just hide the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison windows side by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . merge the current file together in the merge menu works even if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot the merge , then the name of the last output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is given to this external command first . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre @-@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for row synchronization to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; refers to the found text in the first log . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line interc@@ ept . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements from one another . example :
instead sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the regular pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... perform selected actions with either all ( F@@ 7 keys ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the file dialog .
when three folders are merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
when you read the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files will be listed which were compared until then .
when the folder scan is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions to open all sub@@ directories and open all sub @-@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders .
double @-@ clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window will appear .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as can be seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries , however , the colour is identical even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are regarded as identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option dir@@ s are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible filen@@ ame for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and select New file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different but the same date appears , then an error message appears . if such errors are not fixed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
when mer@@ ging , a file is processed by the other . you indicate the status column when mer@@ ging was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected happened . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is ok anywhere .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all the entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then C will be used as a destination in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode , and B will be selected as the target while synchron@@ izing A and / or B as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all the entries in the destination folder should be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current item : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid merge actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options through , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( set up Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can enter multiple patterns . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match that pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would be ignored by CVS too . many aut@@ olog@@ ous generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be adjusted to a .@@ c@@ v@@ indication file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a ver@@ tex attribute . in other file systems , a preceding point sel@@ ects a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
if the option is switched off , symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be checked and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security . please use caution .
similar to the change date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this can be useful , for example , if the modification date has been lost . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are the same . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file will be suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders .
normally the folder merge view remains visible to the merge of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can disable the option Directory &amp; Text window and switch between the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and the text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do so , use the current file mer@@ ging from the merge menu .
this status is lost , however , if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contained . it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished , whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the permissions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( please refer to the option of selecting the size . ) ( this is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts first always with the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3 Part display from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is applied as K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3 Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . bringing together or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ h it Kom@@ pare ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines disappear next to each other , this is more often the case .
this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort for this was too big so far . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit a larger amount of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; released and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ r@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the sub@@ folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties arise , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift In@@ sert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current marker .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder after changes to these options . )
this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the A , B and C lab@@ eling below the menu bar . if you click one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both within a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other working areas .
the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries to set up ... and termin@@ ate . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and exit . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other areas of work .
when this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is ti@@ cked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty areas are displayed to allow their selection .
the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from P@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in horizontal and vertical right in a vertical row , which is very well suited for representation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move the windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switches ... let the dialog appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not own a write permission for the file , you must login as user root or contact your system administrator .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a movable magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid displaying the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter setting . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not yet able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fication window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Sm@@ ur@@ f &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lu@@ p . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to make use of a screen area , use a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter is resting on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter has remained in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive pen@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and can em@@ ulate pain with the mouse . this requires little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain caused by the mouse click and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere moving of the mouse may cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary equipment , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drag@@ ging by pressed mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be st@@ owed after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool .
when Intelli@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the shooting range is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button , wait before it release the mouse button again , if no moving is done in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking by mouse shift . if this feature is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to shor@@ ten the reaction time . to do so , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will start ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already cli@@ cked the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of Apply .
it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of which places a click of a mouse is left without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse varies . it should be clear , however , if you view the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when a move is started . if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you do yourself a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving may cause unwanted reactions . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the tit@@ els of windows .
I try to work with intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely to copy text into the clip@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice about it :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , simply select a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is done every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . this allows you to know exactly when sliding the move time . later , you can use the smart move also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window should be installed . this should be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling process to start before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag@@ ging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; mouth ; is a program that can let silent users talk to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sets which are to be re @-@ spoken .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the speech output of text . see the description of the setup di@@ alogs for more details .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can select often used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can be edited naturally .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for the word @-@ passing . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the lists of words with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a sequ@@ encer of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you are properly set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select from it sets which are to be re @-@ spoken .
with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the wor@@ ter@@ fold page as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , you specify the character encoding that is passed on to the language generator with the text .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box if the text is still to be passed on to the language generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service , &amp; mouth ; first try to pass on the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box Action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by short@@ cuts or by choosing a text passage in the text passages or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of heart@@ strings the selected text passage is spoken directly and added in addition to the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially entered only in the input field .
with the second selection box C@@ lose the edit window for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the edit window .
with the selection of text pass@@ book store , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Save , will &amp; mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be saved .
the wor@@ ter@@ fold page contains a list of dictionary entries . in the main window , next to the input field , shows &amp; mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the dictionary currently used .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and select the language in the selection box .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is easily determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the dic@@ tion@@ aries available . &amp; mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you set a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar , or a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sections of the exp@@ eller memory .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sections of the exp@@ eller memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar is by default placed above the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is cli@@ cked , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . the bar is by default placed above the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you haven &apos;t entered the command for voice output properly or not completely . open Settings ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card voice output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line to set up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ ve@@ form , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax happily swal@@ lows the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . the complete command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data must be turned on as default input .
the voice output dem@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wide voice service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot talk to output text through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re @-@ spend .
note that &amp; mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows every application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers are ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS abilities .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
speech output is done through the speech speech program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , etc .
enables creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) using the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech mark@@ up language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech mark@@ up language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service from &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can subscribe to the list via htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ ind@@ s. the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Channel # k@@ de @-@ ind@@ entation ) .
before you can use it , you will need to install speech @-@ schedul@@ er and adjust it correctly . see also
on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no actors are set up , the card board is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the map is displayed General .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those who differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you start &amp; t@@ t ; otherwise the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
when you click on the flash@@ card leader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card board is displayed . it also appears automatically when you start t@@ t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all pre @-@ arranged speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not give a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls range to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the Spe@@ aker menu . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can go back to the map general and check if the voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; starts . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create text orders and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker you can start the &amp; k@@ de language delivery system . click the General tab to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card map will be displayed and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the mark , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it will run ; on , if the voice output field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the Control bar &apos;s system area when reading , it disappears again as soon as the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , stop and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages .
the card list is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab card in General and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read before , and select the text output in the main menu .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; head@@ lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read before , and select the text output in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; it noti@@ fies you about events you have set . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear al@@ erts in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes tags b@@ r and b from messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be accepted in most cases as provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before being sent to the speech speech . it is useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filters work , it &apos;s important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed following the issue of the warning .
messages have the highest priority . a message stops normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you have a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . any order you use from the card order is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this output is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be even further types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre @-@ defined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the re @-@ format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or by e @-@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with voice selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sends the text to &amp; t@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the speaker card , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it passes the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters which were set up on the page below . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are processed in series to down@@ wards .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for setting string replacement filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . case sensitive is not observed when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Re@@ place column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . if you load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID number @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter a copy .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Remove filter when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ations ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs add or edit as help for putting these expressions . the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ ron@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT @-@ files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible through the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaking voice selection filter you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that specify the text , which sends the text to &amp; t@@ ts ; and the features of the speaker set on the board of the card are selected .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you can specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected that best meets the required requirements . click on the button on the right to view the dialog box selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber output filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen Fil@@ ters if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both APIs is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . first start in a window , then t@@ t@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; conver@@ ters filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone for S@@ able to work at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also , make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is installed and found using the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the option encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string reduction filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license which you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can find the source code under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ organic .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer among the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that is not yet contained in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to bro@@ aden and expand the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile &amp; execute , you need a recent development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the pack@@ ets k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for download or downloaded the Tar@@ ot created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use a speech syn@@ thesizer , make sure that speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be developed in such a way that the creation of speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ chers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can go back to pro@@ posi@@ tional or paragraph styles , repeat the output , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker is used . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ man sel@@ ects , you will see in .
when you click Add to add a speaker to the list , and in order to add a speaker to the list , or click Edit , the Voc@@ abulary Book is displayed below . as an example , the setup of the Module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in the PAT@@ H festival , you just have to enter the festival .
select the encoding for text handed over to the festival . in the case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controls and display them gray , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow you to set these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first movement is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed on the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol named kt@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the Spe@@ aker @-@ ID corresponds to the column ID on the card board speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can pre@@ - or rever@@ t to the order placed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on the OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be taken over and will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then , click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the Audio box . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed . output of screen re@@ a@@ vers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the respective audio module or kt@@ ts ; cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
imagine the speaking speed here . 50@@ gr ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ ,@@ 00@@ .@@ % about the double normal speech speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , select Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message stops normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you have a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room is welcome .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds tim@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read Noti@@ fy messages , start t@@ t@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card alert appears .
select this check box to switch to &amp; k@@ de ; disable noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are from &amp; point ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as top entry in the list on the card board . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is set for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as a final option , the action will be carried out , which was specified under Standard ( all other events ) .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) for this purpose , you can specify the following noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button Load to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the standard voice used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ gr ; SS@@ ML text is generally spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds divide text into individual sentences . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter . at the first start of a punc@@ tu@@ ation filter , a pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other set @-@ limit detection filters , but beginners will be dep@@ rec@@ ated .
the easiest way to learn is to set up the subscri@@ ber selection by trying out . switch on the subscri@@ ber selection and select text to read . switch on the list of subscri@@ ber boxes , change some features , and check how the subscri@@ ber &apos;s selection changes . of course , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start faster with reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or stop text orders on the card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filter is set automatically when you start t@@ t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set @-@ limit detection filters compare text with a regular expression for punc@@ tu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( Dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab character are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default pro@@ posi@@ tional sign filter preserves the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , warning messages , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers .

you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the Spe@@ aker menu . the card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the speaker card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which displays all the features of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; execute this speaker . otherwise , you select the speaker , which is most likely to match the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker features by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property is to have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the language is present if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language other than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker select and then use the speaker , which is closest to the following .
in this case there is 0 for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) .

I have invited an extra voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the card board for speaking device . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML b@@ ypass filter , and set up the speaking speed .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you can find help in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software to festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to set for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option has to be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ kal@@ ische analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice sharing system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival produces this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone .
this procedure adds an additional wra@@ pper code to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the folders festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module will display network settings in &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network features .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and release status . by selecting non @-@ re@@ visions , the setting can be made permanently . then , when setting up the network settings , then this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , click on the button system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode , which is divided into three tabs :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . the following tasks can be carried out by the rider network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... can be edited in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
with the option Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are simultaneously started with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or switched off , depending on your needs . switch on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface .
network devices can be enabled or disabled according to need . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and click on interface to de@@ activate ....
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine asks htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Beh@@ ind or Her@@ under in priority .
clicking on the Add ... button from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . then the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... the Edit dialog will be displayed .
the name @-@ known calcul@@ ator lists host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
usually , the list of particular known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still exists in the test should replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will display .
enter the name of the known computer and click Add . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit ... The Modi@@ fied Computer dialog will be displayed .
you can perform one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to enable the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a rpm console ; with rpm as below :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice , but in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is recommended for experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never found great pre@@ val@@ ence . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future , and this description currently focuses on the common IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in external networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact point that has@@ ries a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore its arbitrary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own host ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , working as a closed circle .
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is a different content found there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different status as expected may therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a tar surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing .
before a tape can be used it needs to be enco@@ ded by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; train the tape back and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . don &apos;t know &amp; dat ; the pre@@ p@@ onder@@ s on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ tension@@ er , searches for the right index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the tape index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; passes through a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape type must be format@@ ted before you can use it to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires a tape to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you are format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; floppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and the capacity , the tape continues . all data on the tape is lost . after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .

right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup is started , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can check again the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .

once the test procedure is started , the dialog will appear for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for review .
if you confirm the settings for the check , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before initi@@ ating the restore , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rec@@ over from the menu .
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the work@@ station for recovery .
when you confirm the settings for the restore dialog , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the tape inde@@ x@@ file by means of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the selected folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up which are located on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be registered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling a tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up through the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option for floppy disks .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must communicate the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be handled directly with &amp; GNU , tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions at your disposal to easily filter and sort the log lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it will open instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log , for the normal user normally no permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or entered strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so that only the log lines will display the entry . in the default setting , the selection box contains the Show All . then a log line is displayed only when the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is checked in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol lines of the stage Note . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can switch to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new lines to be added .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; enables the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage extra sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; has its own website at htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. You will find more up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of &amp; k@@ System@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; also find in the following folder des &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of the program starts when the system starts up in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux kernel looks first in / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to launch when you boot the system or switch to another run level . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only launched once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds .
the default runtime is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning section you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably see that the default runtime is 3 . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have a bit mess@@ ed up then you can fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when a K contains , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . moreover , I could also have a user runtime , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other hand tool is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six Run@@ ners to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this only happens when they pull out an entry from the area of the available system services .
note : items are moved when you drag them to a new range . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ time , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run level , move it to clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl + X ) and insert it in the desired Run@@ ners with In@@ sert ( C@@ trl + V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , it will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n and now the machine is constantly changing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the Enter key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed for running under Run@@ time X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please refer to the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply stop without message if their configuration files are not present or false .
the significance of the &amp; Linux ; runtime varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ time so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapters Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading .
after you have made any changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save button in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled limited space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card is created , where you can make individual settings . further flash@@ cards appear , if shadow passwords , or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the password management tab appears when shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if space constra@@ int ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized for at least one fil@@ esystem space constra@@ int ( see the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the limited space limitations are in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with limited space limitation .
the tab card groups are informed about the group members of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the group &apos;s Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works similarly .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot the default OS , add , remove , modify operating systems , remove , change , and more .
