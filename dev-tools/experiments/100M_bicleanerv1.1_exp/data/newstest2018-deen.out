Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a chapel that is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the erst@@ while cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories on days .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that had to be exciting because the car sat on a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one cannot recognize as such .
in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called judgments , were incorporated for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying authorities between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops concluded with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was registered 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , when Munich &apos;s district was established .
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in appears a smaller @-@ part map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; primitive reception &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small plots there are no more farmers today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in sun . &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the composition sheet , in the area of the present district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen one reads not only the street name &quot; am Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the height &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße people locked up people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was managing the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , finished the ank@@ le of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from using force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
there was room for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the centri@@ fu@@ gal force in 1905 .
Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people now meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
to the west is the football field of the TS@@ V München Eastern , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a chapel from the Middle Ages stood at Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days are the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn core track will take place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ours has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , is calling for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ians to take special attention while travelling through the state and to be noted here , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based incidents are to be found throughout the country and can be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim to minorities , the group declared that the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year under question@@ able circumstances after he had no more gasoline during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be prepared to bring ch@@ ewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 Hass@@ an Bre@@ ak in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ an Bre@@ ton report of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws , forcing local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further ra@@ cial differentiation .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
the electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n Project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac made a picture on site .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U town association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the legal graves of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ arten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative market@@ able way for him for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ arten , only Regi@@ on@@ ales arrive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the chairman of the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Bas@@ in , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably manage on such steep areas .
the green area is a lot of work , a lot of things have to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and used it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he does not lead a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and worry about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed for funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the surface area is 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farmers it doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the regional care line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state funding of electric f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the existence of a funding set drawn by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be enclosed must not be pass@@ able ( slope of over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Di@@ electric Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , who would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the most secure sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans este@@ em these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olog@@ ues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ ow@@ ls and liberty @-@ im@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but it took its significance , and in particular the importance that was attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the monument was completed , was added to its base .
as Miller a@@ co@@ sta described , &quot; I don &apos;t want to mention a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is materi@@ ally right , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who long to breathe freely , the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends , who set themselves to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political act .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classic portra@@ yal .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives that the American flame goes into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch will not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever like to recognize .
their torch will not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
the Director of Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong cont@@ ingent of the world championship cad@@ res will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special has been developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that there is something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h did quite naturally , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , competing in her fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 @-@ m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mid@@ range runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , which one should observe after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved with med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take a long time until the papers struck him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles .
he was kno@@ cking at the cri@@ tique , for sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and dropped the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union was therefore compl@@ aining about him at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ il@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Mr Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too simple to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not profound .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same issue , they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical clo@@ aks or to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County decre@@ ed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter recor@@ ders hit his lead .
even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zing his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t sil@@ ently put them to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round last year before losing against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player who is home to South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year are coming back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who , after his 50@@ th birthday , came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year , returns to the action on home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish performance ever since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer deaths are due to passive smoking every year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking every year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new investigation is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ inger Straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the Bau@@ hof Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noticeable in the plans .
traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , is a big problem for the building pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family in the un@@ spo@@ ilt Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the co@@ iled tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most village men are unemployed , and many people drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into everyday life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was admitted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public raising in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up independence from the Dutch rule turned quickly against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal guar@@ dians .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea was the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desolate . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo hed@@ ger@@ ms , and made of corrugated sheets , which were converted by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but Indonesia is also the gold land of Indonesia .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Phoenix Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port valued 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua boasts wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in one single officer .
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal lands in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the United Nations Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ der Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the Erz@@ s@@ ö@@ z@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents happen every week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have intensified , as Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ding cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are struggling to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - ta@@ sted their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President , J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai had suffered a depression only two months after the inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers attacked their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their gun barrels , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten to fall into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua boys , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - running in the circle and im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing a bird song - from Pap@@ ua Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began hur@@ ting stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings occurred only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he uses an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely un@@ beli@@ ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , be afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site bure@@ au .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting on the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble maker for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by shooting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ top leaders came from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : mainly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , having arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the president of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to shoot .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ er &apos;s election campaign were not realized to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai firing .
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said Jak@@ arta journalists : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
Go@@ bai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never receive justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ tures the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise building in just two years , which one accidentally calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing fire at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said that she is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can re@@ vit@@ alize questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by management of the g@@ ate@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from cl@@ adding , outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for isolation and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal made for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two profits was not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but also very valued five @-@ sentence classics , the traditional competition is thus preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ ce missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to ensure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not until now , after many contradictions , the proposal had come before the proposal to carry out the final on a neutral location .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the following year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ er , the requirements for training places etc. will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to perform fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items were s@@ mu@@ g@@ ged at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had been bel@@ ated that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who agreed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , was 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items that were intentionally drag@@ ged by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted to have know@@ ingly borne objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods had brought about by airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that the people who are the most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly the most frequently .
the company however points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they can take or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while , people thought T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .

so far , he has under@@ estimated that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less brilliant number when announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
Mus@@ k dre@@ amed : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 had already been withdrawn .
critics always pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euros ( in the US $ 1000 and the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations appe@@ aled , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be assembled - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines that have never been tested in practice without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Head P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s on account of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being accused by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the environmental authority , with@@ drew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that was raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline that expi@@ red on October 1 for States to comply with the standards of O@@ zone for soil @-@ related o@@ zone standards in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was accused by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations for chemical industry and fossil fuels industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA authority sur@@ passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the EPA &apos;s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for performing and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to determine the date for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that some@@ time P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive reform of the O@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet voted by the Senate .
the New York &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States , who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ ten &apos;s surprise change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday 16th July at 4.@@ 30@@ pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made friends and suppor@@ ter tum@@ ours to their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ary chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer premi@@ er : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ our Hill , apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the right of pat@@ ron@@ age belonged , and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the local picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the glorious settlement centre of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 have under@@ pinn@@ ed these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval village law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .
associated with it was the right to use a priest or propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two were crushed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later it had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church @-@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the final resting place for the dead from hearing schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ary Church was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
during the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortun@@ es , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as a promot@@ er , friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with speeches by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 15 : 30 a.@@ m .
the seren@@ ade of the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers provide the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and audi@@ tors .
friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home care , such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to let approval of wind turbines be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refra@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not consider any legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refra@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called upon District Council Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen a wind force concentration zone existed only at the border with Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
these zones are intended to prevent the landscape being &quot; par@@ amount . &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier by a change in the land use plan - but that had not approved the district government Düsseldorf because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legislation , the granted approval certificate remains un@@ lawful and therefore also rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refra@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the provision of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been entered at the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her on the occasion to re@@ consider the matter .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with a view of ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had concluded le@@ ases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ vor@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured .
two other people were injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
according to the police , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch went with her car in the course of accompanying driving with her 53 year old mother as accompanying person the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to attract residents to shopping in the city centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heimat Sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city provides away from the usual supermarket commodity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training vac@@ an@@ cies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the stores of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mit@@ ter@@ bury @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is aimed not only on residents of the city and the region .
in preparation were commerci@@ als on the radio , an Internet video and printed p@@ ou@@ ches which point to the event weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; for well @-@ gro@@ unded Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened again or again .
this includes tourists and tourists .
but many locals also lost the city center while shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was a good idea to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was a bit wider , king said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities took part in the nation &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation for local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

tr@@ ump after trans@@ liter@@ ated tran@@ scripts of telephone calls in Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump was calling on a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president described him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and disclosed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dump &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after Mr. Turn@@ bull said , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ massacre : activists manage rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury launched a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and went to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es broke the silence , when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
fortunately this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience ble@@ w very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been syn@@ ced by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organisation of po@@ sterity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt @-@ stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the state Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights activists .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a sheet on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was ever accused of .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice gave the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the pre @-@ election campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election stab@@ bed according to the FB@@ I of the black color ten@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore was not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they got away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , eliminated evidence and perpet@@ u@@ ated the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene managed the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is descri@@ p@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many would like to believe in America no longer exists .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
calf Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member for many years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ne@@ sts cri@@ es out and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , he van@@ ishes from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona respon@@ ds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people were &apos; n --- &apos; they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors was funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the tough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed humans .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ a says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repetition exp@@ ires violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a gri@@ eving dress is about the bodies of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ eld sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song end , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit at their heads , record the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta talks about the post @-@ position with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people that look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks lives at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reproduction is in some way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans to Bayreuth
in the fourth install@@ ment of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful and fri@@ vol@@ ous setting in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the Wall Rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ in and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo coming from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ h@@ unters are pos@@ ing as a rock energy or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil waters recall Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ sau@@ chter - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise wonderfully well as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess se@@ duce Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier dig@@ ging a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he killed Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) must also believe in it .
the audience ow@@ es it to the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are ha@@ unted stor@@ my , who hum@@ bly bows his hands to Merkel &apos;s space .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat back in casual leisure wear .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ellen@@ ic pipe concert on his own , five years later there was great rejo@@ icing in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rods went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is pleased to have been pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its way of view .
I draw a positive resume .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in st@@ on@@ ef@@ ull in the furniture market , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open all @-@ day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that happen ?
amount : I graduated from school .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realised for myself that it is a fal@@ seh@@ ood for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe , really .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing your FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that provoked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one always has other people up@@ side down , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British Education Group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will disman@@ tle further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced .
the job sh@@ edding , which Director General John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and in the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced in a third cost cutting program a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack killed in suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , and shared a NATO Declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of NATO it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the wounded are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a Kab@@ ul , chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite district .
the Tali@@ ban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country &apos;s dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani , in recent weeks .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Decision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Rule
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the emissions @-@ causing emissions . this happened one day after 15 states accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulation 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to establish stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda driven by Tr@@ ump to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EP@@ O &apos;s website says that breathing air , the o@@ zone containing &quot; the lung function , and can increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .
community wants community room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the municipal council of flu@@ orn @-@ win@@ ches resol@@ ves the establishment of a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although the area is still owned by the church community , it will still take some time , but there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are facing such a community space not just as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ iors just living , but openly in the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , is determined by means of funding .
the building is located in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a common room would be , so reported T@@ j@@ ades , eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent .
the resolution fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this respect no bil@@ lets should be thrown between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - which are le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as pent roof - which would reduce the height of the tr@@ ump and make the building more economical .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means , be this addition .
when it helps : it happens unanim@@ ously to the body .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many separate buildings with which one does not move forward so right now , they now rest in the community room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface one does not give a subsi@@ dy , but get a real equivalent in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to split the proposal accordingly , will find three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
thus it remains with two opposing voices in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; if we put the decision in this way , we make a giant step towards closing a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and was seriously injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction gave him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder landed on the road , he obviously did not look at the counter @-@ traffic .
he met with a car which was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the World Cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
with human resources , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger .
personnel managers at the German Football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical state and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was last but not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
wander@@ ing in resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin the nation &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emerge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the purpose of the association &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; ( Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg ) .
there is a planetary path in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and star pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the arrow will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star trail , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was more light than another , although it was much far@@ ther away .
let us also know in which con@@ stellation is a selected star , and when it is best to be seen .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest situated astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Indian@@ arium , there is something similar to the planned Star@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Trail .
beginning in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ planet &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( district Glei@@ chen ) with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to dem@@ oted to the d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the total distance of the planet &apos;s path is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to plug@@ ins requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fix would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the hall to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday in Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how are you going to champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; up to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weight plates &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand that .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) that also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title match in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ ons Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held out with the generous pra@@ ises for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show striking strength then boxes .
they both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top warri@@ ors , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four Ver@@ ses after Ty@@ re Plat@@ a
on Thursday afternoon , four people were severely injured during an accident on the A@@ 7 .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then stayed on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left side of the road was passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; the three chain works better &quot;
after the 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the optimisation of defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , if the two opponents were not at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf defense player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the supply chain should also be further optimised .
and a gate after a free fall , the For@@ tun@@ ers don &apos;t want to capture themselves any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that nobody else besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) is on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better right after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain link , than with the four @-@ chain link .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his cause , &quot; because we currently have players at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko found@@ el@@ mann . &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we cannot afford so many mis@@ understand@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak of a mis@@ guided start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can get four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her , because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascension favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland work as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stup@@ idity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ holder assessment tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish migration authority ( migration verk@@ et ) was critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were under age .
until today , migration verk@@ et posted 6,@@ 8@@ 80 tests and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the findings of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly told that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in the x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they used to go through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
works on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are proceeding well .
on Wednesday a heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the department of road construction and transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1.@@ 30 m wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a boundary mount , which is also used as an operating mode .
at the southern part of the bridge , a bridge crane with a width of 2.@@ 20 metres is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special part is that these are finished parts , a patent of Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger @-@ sp@@ itz@@ ing feeling has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable connected to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans first had to be caught off .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach city entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridge refur@@ bish@@ ments amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to get under a hat .
the parties represented in the chal@@ k of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) are part of a broad alliance that marks a peaceful flag on that day because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle to the &quot; big election campaign clock . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land makes the top duo for the election of the Bundestag on September 24 , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally planned , the town picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , is now taking place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reports that he has tried such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kirchen enough parking spaces are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the front square he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good people &apos;s right , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the venue , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ person Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
trumpet meets trumpet
there is a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher trump@@ ets Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian Tr@@ ump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Schwar@@ zwald , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; hits a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo violin of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unites the desire not only to transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
this is how Johann Sebastian Bach stands for the two as in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ ger N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and the free play mix to a fascinating overall artwork .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was only premi@@ ered this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the most famous relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette musician ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was deeply in love with whom I have had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think I &apos;d played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never conf@@ uses me or hin@@ ders me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she especially suffered from the school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I &apos;ll look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some people call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes his party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised beforehand a big announcement at West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump took West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the country , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal mine from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , who would rather hin@@ der us from doing so in order to make our country look great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of f@@ ew@@ est legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he reiter@@ ated that it was not the moment for the country to be re @-@ admitted into the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ t@@ ine said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were taken away from competition gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a speech at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers st@@ amped in Mali
during a funeral service in the north Hes@@ sian town of F@@ ritz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two soldiers killed by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ solved crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice made by them in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old st@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at mid@@ day only the relatives in the church took their leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
ro@@ ses settled down , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ s and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the fallen soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ra@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rod sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flying operation of the fighting helicopter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crew couldn &apos;t turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali ruled by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ yen not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are being buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave near his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agrees with her husband &apos;s decision , she said it further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also laid down the title &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ mahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not after death , said L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the leader of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bl@@ eman , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife &apos;s sympathy with the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the gau@@ lo@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand &apos;s society @-@ critical intellectual , I could not hope for for@@ esi@@ ght .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
the Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the Parliament &apos;s resolution on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising withdrawal of a Green Euro MP from her country @-@ day fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover thus lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP .
the present Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 vote in her constitu@@ ency circle in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U fac@@ tional leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ank@@ ler will recommend his group to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this meant that CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be regularly elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ank@@ ers said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l remains indispensable for the fact that the Land@@ tag quickly resol@@ ves its self @-@ dissolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the state parliament el@@ ects the trust and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options have to be checked legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ank@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ank@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens demanded the dissi@@ dent de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country &apos;s mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she returns her country tag , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to speak out in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Euro MPs to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her latest vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U fac@@ tional leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests in the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 country election with a personal career .
at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD and the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gi@@ g@@ gling , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal be ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp recovery .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ foodstuffs war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all that we are currently aware of , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economics ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has been dis@@ connected immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since we have become acquainted with the s@@ adness of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessments are available for consumers .
trade has just the same way as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are transpor@@ table and harmless to health .
if the residual hardness of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , they are not traffic @-@ capable .
however , un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time not the factories are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers located in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , the production companies are not directly responsible .
rather , they have to expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices by service companies .
as always there are too little controllers in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is it missing only at the staff or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ utor in the cases in which off@@ ences can be present is of decisive importance .
I have repeatedly made clear that I am expecting a complete education from the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm mis@@ m necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to buy only safe and market@@ able food .
when an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
by means of the pan@@ ted means manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ delivering animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all responsible authorities that the facts are resolved swiftly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Fis@@ cal Rules of Football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed issues from European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that super@@ vis@@ es the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove some@@ time that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the wealth of wealth of Qatar .
clubs may have a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they have to counter with legitimate income sources enabling them to break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had accumulated enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin if banks or owners re@@ trac@@ ted their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentr@@ ating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor , A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are off excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat fee , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the loss of revenue for the next five years amounting to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million can be stated in the annual financial statements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first wave of sanctions in 2014 was hit by PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise ordinary 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ist company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambassador is going to be ambassador and could easily find such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , told on Thursday people who were familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association expects that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing the contract .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ senal manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss Life .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed chocolate panels at 14 grams will distribute the flight atten@@ dant before landing on the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but what is more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to disclose how many applicants there will be a new tender .
only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for an opinion .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board their flights since 2006 .
Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter .
Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the First Class customers will be spo@@ ilt by goo@@ dies from the confection@@ er Spr@@ ün@@ gli , Business Class n@@ ags Vo@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short circuit Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is also sharing business as well as in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking den@@ ose vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by bra@@ cing at the core of the g@@ ag - actors of middle aged play cool children who will grow - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who play adults now , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting can@@ yon principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point a character rum@@ mage through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy vi@@ cious P@@ lot that is included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well done impression from Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s under@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it is the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repe@@ ating &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two Buchar@@ est officers fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues will be synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice tags for watching ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , like Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who we@@ ars a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy isn &apos;t fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef repeat@@ ed@@ ely visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick males who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian authors were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police hit the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
in the process , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 and have already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore likely to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian agents were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime , heavy violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the C@@ ID Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the big work was accompanied by four officers from Palermo .
in the course of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als mainly came to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
way to claim large gaps in the foreign register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to a report , the foreign Registry in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country @-@ country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis presented by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including about 5.@@ 7 million people from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data were not adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in some cases , data from 1921 have been found &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and no longer should appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data entries can considerably slow down reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who do not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assignments led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with tax@@ pay@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they have entered the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - the BA@@ MF can be carried out again in Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper comm@@ its itself to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state , whom they first achieve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a immig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can return it to the country of entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the admission and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ t@@ HR ) considers these commitments enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would send refugees back there as part of the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the domestic spokes@@ woman of the parliamentary group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare due to the short@@ com@@ ings of the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now donated 50 litres of blood to his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the municipal council , the congregation appreci@@ ates the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out for it , and we have respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , not self @-@ serving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the cann@@ ed foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house has led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Re@@ beer were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for each 50 donated blood donations .
half as many of them book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter have sold 500 milli@@ litres of their juice for ten times each .
the Bank of England will hold the interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ en the spec@@ ulation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it maintained interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted in favour of 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that interest rate increases would be needed over the next few years in order to brid@@ le the inflation raised by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected from the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut Business Package , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the next February , although it has been said that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets expect .
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the bank stressed that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are forecast for this and next year as compared to the 1.9 % forecast predicted in May and 1.7 % .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on interest rates and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor wage increases , as the sharpen@@ ing will be even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the down@@ turn in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recovered at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which can be attributed to the weak pound , which will compensate a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years before it will fully reach the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose , as inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be attrac@@ ting them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the transgres@@ sion in relation to its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the recent down@@ fall of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ iring and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will have access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight before the High Court in September after a fight against the funding of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis held before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the Health Service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious areas .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
for those who are eligible for treatment , gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
appropriate participants are identified in clinics including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in to participate in their local participating sex clinics .
the program will be signed by £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the overall potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence such as targeted , targeted and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September on people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individual controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ ank in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot square has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and an mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to make use of 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create an mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends in order to let it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the tops and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposite , so that when you push the door , you gli@@ de very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne gained additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real estate agent will enter a ru@@ di@@ mentary form and carry out a calculation based on the size of the soil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which will help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself into something quite amazing with a good design and an elevated square meter number .
indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers struggling for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate empire Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and business assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family founded West@@ co je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - von Paul described as &quot; the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record states that this means Col@@ in property has a value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in an Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed medi@@ tations , the first hearing was held by the Supreme Court .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul affir@@ ms , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in an in@@ competent manner .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties .
wife De Lu@@ tis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that Mark has been paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contact Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Chief of Staff Tr@@ um@@ ps plans to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried it and have failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in mail@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame dump by monitoring its media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit controlled , according to six former campaign officers , is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep it away from him a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented the fact that Tr@@ ump has spark@@ ed controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - fully occupied with this story - told in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with le@@ aking le@@ aks , and that he can figure out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone announced to the President a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of Stab@@ s@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ smith added that then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police across Europe send mail to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and asked for .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting at vacation destinations were hiding , called it by Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards were compiled for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , this website has been viewed at www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wo , more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online search@@ ings could be found so far , at least eleven of them due to information after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a tren@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back on a war foot@@ ed with some determined travellers , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May , but without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging dug by the council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ imped@@ ed to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must indeed be forced by Sch@@ am to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay for my community tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof you will find the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1st next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente company company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 nights were lost per year at the time and also revenues from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time in the municipal council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &quot; Lord Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald &quot; defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested people at the house at that time .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof already there are building sh@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance for a longer time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty ci@@ vic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room belong to the equipment .
it is impossible to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer points out .
Sch@@ erer explains the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its 60 rooms spread wide .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sh@@ aver .
the ideas of the city are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outside facilities are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Set Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US president Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller will have deployed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper became a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigation .
the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N reported that there are already the first pre @-@ invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time , specifically interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investig@@ ators focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ cans during the election campaign .
as a result , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Sonder@@ er@@ issu@@ er Tr@@ ump was put in the centre in person and asked the accus@@ ation whether the President might have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to raise charges . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called anch@@ oring chambers .
mostly they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial instances .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the body can also be consul@@ ted by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to invite people to act under E@@ id .
according to the station CN@@ N , pre @-@ invitations have already been issued that revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were asked to testify , was called in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his former campaign chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension indicates that Mu@@ eller would not be intim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he would act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end in order to decide on the accus@@ ation of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , the President made a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his Special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that accelerated the work of the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he would not be as@@ cer@@ tained against the President .
I have no reason to believe that something has changed , it was stated in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June Com@@ ey testified before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump invited him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after representation of US media , the White House collected material against the Sonder@@ er@@ issu@@ er and his staff .
it spark@@ ed spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was sack@@ ed .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the late president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday , after which the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the Western Antar@@ c@@ tica , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened from the Sch@@ el@@ ven .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tonne and 5@@ 800 square kilometer , is now driving north and will need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that have registered researchers in the last three decades .
he is not a danger to people .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
however , for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fest .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this archipelago , the balance of wa@@ xing and abor@@ tion was dis@@ rupted a few years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ ven will fall apart , writes A@@ WI researchers Daniela Jan@@ sen .
I am talking a lot about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is in danger , as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow straight into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only slightly , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e of Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ven will grow again or go back over the long term and possibly collap@@ ses , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even though these researchers did not lead the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , however , in recent decades , however , many of the polar bears of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart .
this long skirt of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends to South America .
according to data from the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature was a contribut@@ ory factor .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated by about three degrees in the last 50 years and thus t@@ ames to the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants a house tari@@ ff at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new positions in the administration prevailed .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first day of work .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously very popular .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
however , the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are 50 non @-@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the wish of the parties , the administration is to develop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act future @-@ oriented candidate shortage .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you previously did not know .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees leaving the service for disease or age reasons .
it is high time for action so that no more jobs are left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , president of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he had a long time already in the circle of chal@@ k for a la@@ zy surprise when he publicly challenged the st@@ aff@@ ing of human resources and amazed the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow an exit from the communal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county government should aim with the unions - perhaps even in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the public service tari@@ ff .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available when you switch to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , coun@@ cil@@ ors Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few personnel .
Italy acc@@ entu@@ ates the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warn that they must not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came one day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ ur@@ ns &apos; because their team effectively worked with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio &apos;s Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s alleg@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ ur@@ ns &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that the crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive off so that the ships can be re @-@ used .
at least one such meeting was allegedly carried out only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board , who super@@ vis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their rescue actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , which meant that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine ham@@ mer be@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal turned out to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Harv@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ kap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
viewing points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were always long asc@@ ents , rewar@@ ding for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the popular saus@@ age market .
again , there was a look@@ out spot at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ versions made welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had become acquainted with the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - spor@@ tive and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for E @-@ Sport
will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium racing at wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
the first federal li@@ ais@@ ons have also recognised this , which are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took part in the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Managing Director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are several clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend the FIFA World Association FIFA in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , you could be present far more often on these markets than once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA are focused on competition level .
as in normal sports , li@@ lies have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the 2022 season E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certain to get used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example , elevated heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
moreover , cognitive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and fast responsi@@ veness are needed .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to play in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative impact of e @-@ sport .
the players are internationally on the move , this is like a large global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by Management Consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to be 130 million .
this is very little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte coun@@ sell@@ ors write .
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition provider Uni@@ ver@@ n .
there is also a lot going on in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ inia .
in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison , Germany lag@@ ging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia , and to glori@@ fy old times is no longer sufficient .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that only in football everything remains as it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy ur@@ ges for suicide
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for a negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy spoke on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward directed eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they fully regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , saying that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day in which I am not rob@@ bing the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will bear for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , stated that she would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I was together since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters disclosed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is to turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that by any press she should benefit from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as captain during the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern op@@ ts a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua called me instantly , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made the bond that he had allocated to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner told afterwards , after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the sign from the coach .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game guide from youth players , de@@ but@@ s and just out of holiday , but he was chosen as a game guide .
sugar is best distributed to those you want to keep in a good mood .
those who were chosen to take the inheritance of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ cked over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
to the right behind , that is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest .
and Kim@@ ber@@ ich took part in this initial formation , just like the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the inv@@ inci@@ ble tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal managed to over@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly folding ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches was trying to get out of the performance of the Asia @-@ trip on the devil , and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver were not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bavarian tri@@ cot .
after all , it worked quite well .
Sü@@ ver ran beside Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy before the def@@ ences , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm proved to be difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ ver proved successful in the game @-@ building a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy stated that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shifting of the game , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game .
Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to a few conc@@ ise statements in the back of his new fellow players .
there he heard from Sü@@ ver an interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .
al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ FB ladies

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak on T V &apos;s request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing addresses the wishes of the economy which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest revers@@ al in infrastructure policy : the gap closing of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priorities list .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the construction law shall stand .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
the goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a guide to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is striving for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine expor@@ ter which has been sack@@ ed for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the passing of the master exam and 2500 Euros if graduates enter the master &apos;s apprentices@@ hip within ten years of the master &apos;s apprentices@@ hip .
however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is to quickly create facts , but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive of the Trier Chamber of Commerce .
up to now , only 29 vac@@ an@@ cies have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing during regional operation .
the Chamber of Commerce is calling for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U fac@@ ts@@ vi@@ ze refers to calculations made by the Court of Audi@@ tors that the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about sto@@ cking internet connections and out@@ breaks .
E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , former Minister of Economy , is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she has already cleared the field because of in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chair said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to prohi@@ bit or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alization of exhaust f@@ umes ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid the faults of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but in normal driving conditions .
several of Volkswagen &apos;s employees were charged in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the visitors to join the Is@@ ar visitors , a raft goes through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
those who pass the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building stock wants to clarify .
on the raft one sees a large Inf@@ otran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to an awareness campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is meant to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a worthy wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll @-@ n@@ oses and Lau@@ ghter against the Sor@@ rows
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , his characters are his trademark .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an even traces with 85 and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he offered himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figur@@ ines cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works every day almost ten hours .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches still find its dro@@ ll figures worldwide .
he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los fav@@ oured animal in his drawings - that has an exchange @-@ foot@@ er as a counter@@ part .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D movie , which will be released in 2019 on the cinema screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather focuses on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced without word .
la@@ ven@@ der threat@@ ens Provence from climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining because of the conditions which are reminiscent of d@@ rought and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes great head@@ aches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed minor , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 years of existence .
the feast of holidays is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ab@@ onds or a land @-@ of @-@ land store are to be experienced in the city centre on these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist acc@@ entu@@ ates the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent may@@ hem in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
you ask the repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings are enough .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under attack and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspiration for Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ era .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and although the terrain is still tra@@ it@@ ec@@ tory .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce newspaper in the state capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot at him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the cont@@ actor drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , aisle members bought any copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second error was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own safety after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he served as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was founded , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever she went .
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the job that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead men ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was His love for routine be his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing paths &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing is happening with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters wonder@@ ed whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers who designated the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto control .
for this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce played three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state spending that concentrated on the native city of the governor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , carried out a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing National Revolutionary Party ( PR@@ I ) , which almost throughout the century ruled all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this pub , one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers would have considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few notes and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist at the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings .
that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to raise international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a a day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of scor@@ ing journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
since then she has asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that in Mexico , journalists were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who put the organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media guard group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .

din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to do@@ dge his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening .
now researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbelievable r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mine worker have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even find out that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably well preserv@@ ative condition has amazed scientists who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
he hit something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the 2500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have discovered that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , even though it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a rotating tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage in order to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to blend better in its surroundings and do@@ dge its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure was hun@@ ted by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his preserved gut , to find out what he had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank to the se@@ abed on his back .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as Sou@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ dose carrier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served fl@@ ak@@ y skin , but also retained in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chal@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he &apos;s asleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge geo@@ des , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ some ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on 21 March 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet long ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were ra@@ ined by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swe@@ pt through Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the water cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the house @-@ branches always cover hol@@ lowed cur@@ b plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as winning in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured panels that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in thunder@@ storms : Mass@@ ac@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re @-@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , around 5 o &apos;clock between the junction boxes Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into one another .
at first there were no information about the exact number of the injured .
it was a light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large number of lif@@ ebo@@ ats were at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , an approximately ten kilometres long tail @-@ jam developed .
like an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , there was also on the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire department noted the characteristics of the vehicle handle@@ bars , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : there is nothing wrong in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an unpleasant or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
one simply confirms by cell phone that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
at present , a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other long haul routes in Germany next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you must have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator &apos;s app , which is anyway the most convenient way of booking the ticket .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you go to the train , call your ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation will then appear among the test customers .
the train atten@@ dant will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket control in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train guide staff , please check the DB Navigator itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Chief Marketing Officer of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest off@@ ences .
because often one does not have all the documents you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets , but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document needed to be presented .
the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the evenings or the large space and delays in controlling one &apos;s own tickets and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s just on the links between ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shocked to her core .
only one day after they arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was placed on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll@@ te by Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from the high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police had just killed a 18 year old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ou@@ ted on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people scre@@ aming , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman ass@@ ures his ri@@ f@@ le and shou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she picked up her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which are from the viewpoint of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation that they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only by activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no other than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter combined with a local business owner who had lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after August 9th , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came into mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt det@@ ain@@ ees .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other local people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are presented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager by Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ list Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black women have to bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these junc@@ tions as a black gay woman standing so much in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the Bit Gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct split the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold the topic hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , and the rest of the shops also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands where 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - to the Bed@@ a square with the opportunity to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying in the farmers market almost a week for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the con@@ cu@@ bin@@ es always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ ch@@ ery for us .
we would like to wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if there is direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should probably not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s the shopping spot in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of that in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger firms , because the rent there are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er .
it &apos;s a shame that special transactions almost no longer exist , and that which is left of it will disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market hall take place during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives .
or does the gh@@ ost @-@ bit gallery already manage to drive all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to introduce a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place .
when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces have to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after making diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ female and dissi@@ dent dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
de@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from 30 portraits , such as anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , al@@ beit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ sleeves and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned bl@@ ouse were too un@@ equal , who in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a com@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Can@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which President Chel@@ ms@@ ford would transform judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also a little deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways in order to fl@@ ames the rigid spl@@ its that he should actually remedy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take along is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a hands @-@ on hands in the United States disciplinary bar@@ racks like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they turn your speech , then they won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if she should do it , she will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic ha@@ un@@ logical groups were written with pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea as the movement stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
a nationwide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several en@@ grav@@ ings .
a joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 La@@ dies has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ vis , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be reviewed and excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal proceedings examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this study , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ assist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to show himself .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he insist@@ ently demands the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza has issued an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA driving plan in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian vice @-@ president Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA driving plan was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA driving plan to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has acknowledged a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we won &apos;t give something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ey &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales outlets at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we repeatedly stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has decided to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA of the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves in the right direction to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs anymore
these were divided by the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion that could not be preceded by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the announcement .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ine anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promise anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she sum@@ mon@@ ed people out of the outside for help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , to offer special groups and demo@@ graphical groups , to provide employees with anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which leaders have low tuning results - so that you can drill why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Finance website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
the client has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has recorded regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
rug@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has implemented Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors that have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cent earned $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want you to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is part of their votes , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
indeed , if a company asks staff according to your feedback , it can have a expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this can raise dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you do not follow people asking yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , &quot; says Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company is constantly gaining new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the team &apos;s new field of practice on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said brother @-@ in @-@ coach Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the fry postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time while Mor@@ as conducted six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they will hold 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s regulatory change even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they continued to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is due to the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been raised with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective network behind a gate post , and will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then preparing to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false news to third parties and then display their results under the original article , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual veri@@ fiers that may show results of the fac@@ tual examination from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks , if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts will be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fake reviews are challenged third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and will work on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creation of a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy sitting in the Main@@ land River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shire with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his stamp of thumb ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ valued &quot; ) this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to look through the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ apers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , cast it on the loft . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing who had what : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history on a broader base , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it priest , who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed out of the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the masters seemed to be quite Ga@@ ther@@ ers , always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote land@@ lords . &quot;
Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences after the end of its use in the castle
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel on E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the opening of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team , Nelson Ar@@ tz , want to keep the logo and slogan at home until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a party at Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website un@@ folded yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
basically we are convinced that as a Bad Honne@@ f citizens we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost an average five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
Turkey &apos;s military reforms - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on pension plans and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the head of the government , the five Deputy @-@ Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the meetings .
thus the civilians in Y@@ AS were in abundance .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar stays in office , but the commander of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wire drawing of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan called the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dis@@ comfort in military headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the he@@ ap ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the great deal with the army and the security forces goes on anyway .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was firing further 7@@ 3@@ 95 public servants by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as guar@@ dians of the world@@ ly state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform agenda of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan drives targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad , would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
he fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by the US to change the way citizens will be issued from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that benefits our business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for the shuttle bus
over the past few months , over the past few months , over the future of the road gate sh@@ utt@@ les has been fought - now it is to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the ailing track on which the tourist railway runs .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start on the track in order to secure the future of the road gate sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this important connection , especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Secretary of State Klaus Techn@@ olog@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reduced the costs for the repair of the route to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future by the country , is currently being defini@@ tively agreed , declared atonement .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia Railway as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said at@@ oning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the race @-@ gate shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is an especially popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , in the course of a pilot operation , it was tested whether the route is used by plenty of people to order them again in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ale in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought that 2017 may not become even more crazy , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes indeed .
sex robots are a big thing right now .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots during the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we have to start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we &apos;ll see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey announc@@ ing his new report .
modern sex pupp@@ ets have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with consciously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; person@@ ages &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex pupp@@ ets have evolved into robots with a silicone membrane .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy Gold Ro@@ bot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has its mo@@ ods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many wor@@ rying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah .
on his site compatible True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ och@@ ed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star pro@@ portions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ary or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ ids
hu@@ um@@ ps high performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney an ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of human dignity
it has become a tr@@ ump outlook of the tr@@ ump era that political divisions that have pol@@ arized the U.S. voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all rep@@ uted to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist po@@ et@@ ess who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she strug@@ gl@@ ed for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely peculiar to the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but I am aware that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the ign@@ om@@ ini@@ ous effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his babies will no longer discharge us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in which tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans norm@@ alize the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump are indeed a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ cked and the animals twi@@ sting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ cking music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
but the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as here two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it in the 40 &apos;s and all have a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was dis@@ ap@@ pointing while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to extend my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs , according to a case in his cell , according to the prison authorities .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet booth in his home in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal may be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the door@@ men of guns and don@@ ors were fired into the vac@@ ations and secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening the school manager An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school discharge , the 29 pupils of the four classes chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the cheerful flock introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from its chi@@ ckens .
instead of a hen &apos;s cr@@ ush , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making him a chicken sh@@ attered , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and wa@@ ved .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the rehear@@ sing of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who bore the cylinders to make the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school manager An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .

two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained because of illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited , cited by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally tents were arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians were subsequently released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and lay down considerable fin@@ es to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission characteristics of cars from emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have become the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Office of force ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has announced to write to each affected person .
if any inspection is due , this will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long should the retro@@ fits be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the bond depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ orists who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
it is likely that foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
now threat@@ ens a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
such as the cultural institution announced on Thursday include singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographic Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be awarded at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania to participate in the award .
the winner of the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows already announced that he would refra@@ in from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that burden me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to make her point of view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
previous prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ ch City Engineer , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a City Engineer since 31 years .
and the work is still a lot of fun for him as he communic@@ ates in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it is wonderful that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way , while resp@@ ecting the regular periods of notice , there should be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach works for the administration community as the Lower Building Law Authority , the applicant has to provide appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill them , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but the city and the city are important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry some important projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ ing@@ space , for example , have begun .
the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium restoration is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will beat with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
there is a great back@@ lash for a city builder .
Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted flexibly to much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the creation of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city construc@@ tor emphasizes .
anyway , the city construc@@ tor bears great responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of support and co @-@ ordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor to remain long : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , according to the city of Has@@ lach , you should provide completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in the field of architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of construction and planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) sub@@ mits construction and civil engineering , building control planning , urban renewal , administration of urban properties , urban farming estate with building yard and urban gardening as well as Lower Building Law Off@@ ices , including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : South track closed
according to the police , the so far unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road gli@@ ding in the area of the Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and are looking for them since the night hours .
a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike driver were observed near the scene of the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz region , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have put themselves in great danger and also end@@ anger the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation , as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail transport , the off@@ ender could also reach the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum to go out said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon again , the railway traffic on the south run@@ way could be led without han@@ di@@ caps .
just under ten people were booked Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they had delays .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger infections are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system applies to people .
the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe that had not been accommod@@ ated separately .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oms had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i spread in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ able cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ able cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ues can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ field player made his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season match , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ supply Asia tour of the blues and only managed to manage 45 minutes , which gave M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to M@@ atic also Victor Lin@@ del@@ and and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but insist@@ ed that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in the U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and retired in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such an advertisement earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD chief , Social @-@ Democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only a camp@@ fire from the central party , merely no head@@ wind out of the wa@@ ist@@ band - was the most important wish of the electoral warri@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been monitoring the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were failures .
one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprise faction exit of a Green Euro MP has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called upon the apost@@ ate low @-@ Sax@@ on Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s desire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Green Party of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner gro@@ ans when the new job message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the mis@@ chief began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades at that time so@@ oth@@ ed themselves .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was it - and indeed everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel led the SPD to stag@@ ger , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
the comrades have lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ped back in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader in the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ environment and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time .
some survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the last few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not hide his comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him alone , because they promised to stabili@@ se the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not responsible for the non @-@ party co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on nature .
and Schulz at all .
at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger appe@@ aled to the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , to the revol@@ t parliam@@ ent@@ arians of T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic how Mr@@ s T@@ v@@ ests puts their own career interests on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ westen was not elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but on the country list of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters made four years ago clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clearing the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments by the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for Center III
who wants to rehabil@@ itate his coming home in the years , can soon get support from the country .
the mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg City Development informed about this on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again made a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there are in sens@@ ations san@@ itation areas .
back then , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I between 1991 and 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II between 2005 and 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a restructuring area III .
the sum of the funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros will come from the country , the rest from the congregation .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will , as Sch@@ in@@ dler further , investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is any interest in rehabil@@ it@@ ating .
if necessary , the area borders may also shift again .
the jet@@ ty represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basement presented the contents of the federal state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot , carried out .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the granting period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of the existing survey , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill in a questionnaire .
in November or December the posi@@ tional decision is to be carried out as soon as possible , so that in the coming year can begin with the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings .
afterwards Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every commun@@ e must carry out the aforementioned preliminary examinations .
it is about evaluating and deciding the situation of urban development when it is rehabil@@ itated and what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make himself a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ o stressed that the project was a key success factor for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which includes , among other things , the structural condition and reconstruction prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing Sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it should be noted that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of the subsidies operated according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes first grin@@ ds .
you can &apos;t reserve funding for later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local center II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project were shown to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home as well as with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the shipping costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises American production last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to military records left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was at the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the Connec@@ tic@@ ut helicopter was issued by a yacht from Ma@@ ine , Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Administration demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn according to the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 : 00 p.m. and until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew was required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
the records provided by the TI@@ ME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event might viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for photo surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet made a service in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Assistant Secretary of the White House Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ Pres@@ idential Support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in issuing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to U.S. Secretary of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D ref@@ unds for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
unit records record the flight time of the aircraft more than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he took his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump addressed representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the post@@ erior pole positions I find the team very well . &quot;
imports from the high north mainly provide class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels attacked the US offensive itself .
after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors from the Austrian O@@ MV , jointly with other European companies , have been co @-@ financed by the construction of the North Stream 2 Russian Baltic Sea coast .
the dr@@ one is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even would have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the centre of the charts by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest bad@@ dies of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kartell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four mighty god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the head of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican bond , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

roll back : the city introduces 46 dishes
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself .
with firm contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal day@@ care centers the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) back in self @-@ control .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , the deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
it continues to be cooked outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and provides fresh cooled liqu@@ ors .
the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time .
in the past kit@@ esur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for by 45 week@@ lies are eating in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour care when children stay at 14 : 00 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ al forces from 1 September kitchen service : they heat the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , leave the food , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the administration to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it &apos;s also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in the ita , a person familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - is done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also under@@ gone the quality improvement of the kitchen capacity as well as the charm that it presented itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical one , it is called the Press Office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces will be recru@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at around 750 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the boss of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , Chief Executive Officer of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the coun@@ ties in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and involve in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year the elections for the first time will take power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reported that 1.2 million women of a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters were registered .

MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in the managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies next to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience as the first if their activities change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expressing concerns that funding for modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the labour forces strongly focus on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of work@@ places , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman at Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond immediately , as we value the ongoing commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and in@@ secure business climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds at our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona be warned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the side of La League enjoys her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not lag behind N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after issuing an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous stamp , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G president three years ago in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him on his lane so that he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail .
material damage emerged on the passenger car .
the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident report , it may be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are Church , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared after publication to the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Em@@ eri@@ fied Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church very much , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the events .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral @-@ cats , it was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and avoided in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is part of everyday life and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and this is a dev@@ oured Fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a quite normal ped@@ ago@@ gical instrument &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for the past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally un@@ justified , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the mem@@ or@@ and@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is there in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber ordered from the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s were subjected to high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; to sum up , it can be said that von Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister lived in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be even more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims noticed that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence against def@@ ences in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became more pal@@ p@@ able when a domain had no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside of his sphere of influence .
one can at best throw at it , experience it too late or have not taken first indications seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as literally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the vast majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger described him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always was surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to hat@@ ching .
that he did not only pop up with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the ground , but also condemned sla@@ p @-@ cow@@ ards and over@@ ly che@@ ek@@ ed guys to the hair or ears , he himself has given up years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widely used in the time , the 1960s and 1970s , both in parents and in teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state grammar school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders whether it is not with his acquain@@ tance and role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just fell on him .
many people who never understood him are still busy at the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report it was reported a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put some involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have been entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the affected people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the investigation of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even famili@@ arise themselves with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then surely not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen School students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student put it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely re@@ ali@@ zations and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I think it ... even for really absurd to assume that it is expected ... to have opened up more intru@@ sive or more clear or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not possible to confirm that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of any co @-@ knowing .
so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate their good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station , between sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence and , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leader of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows .
all the horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were arbitr@@ arily har@@ assed and portra@@ yed , all of them at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , like most witnesses stress , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um &apos;s gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , at most , the reproach remains to have looked away .
yet despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and from his predec@@ essors at a school in which he was not responsible and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently give ear to the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test penalty will continue to be practiced &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he received urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as audi@@ tors were also banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , like everyone else knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where the limit was really exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 the test for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger to evaluate the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times and not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the then beyond that time .
it &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m happy that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so to pull ear @-@ h@@ amm@@ ers and to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was forbidden , he also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shown in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of testing also apply to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , meaning Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , as the dom@@ es only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not at all hide that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but that also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world class from the rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not make a big singer from the un@@ ru@@ ly boy and before each success , no matter which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundament@@ alist , deep @-@ believing and hear@@ tless people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something wrong with a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former dom@@ es today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ zation , keep in touch with him regularly , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not forgiven him so far that he once was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person to whom they still look up and glori@@ fy them .
and please , once more clearly : all that you submit to him are educational methods that were at the time of the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intention behind it , all too obvious .
for the report that was just released reli@@ eves him .
now the starting point would be , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who earned himself great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps still Germany , nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen to finally leave it in peace .
