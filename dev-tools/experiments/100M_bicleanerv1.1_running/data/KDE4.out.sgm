<seg id="1">"" "translate the" "" "Website" "" "page in the & konqueror; menu under Extras" "" "translate" "". "select the source and target language of the translation from the list below." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this section will be translated as the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish in the best case produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated from the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert texts into translation directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, choose settings extensions.... Open the map card tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the box kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror, before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools Cancellation. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Positioning Filter module (also known as the folder filter) can be found in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Application Filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's up-to-date working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; to use, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed webpage. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this node node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides an additional view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views so as to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; is to graphically display nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree-map. tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; this reflects the size of a file or folder, specifying the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have useful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched over View color mode, can either display depth for easy recognition of the depth or the representation of another file feature such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or if the area of sub-arranged rectangles should be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of Treemap in & FSView, it should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with. it is drawn frame in order to show the nesting of entries, and this frameworks need space, which is no longer available to the subordinate entries.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is always advantageous for labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames so that rectangles arise that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive two.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View to hold on an area. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery... or Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you call the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens, which allows you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Image per line option has a slider and a script to set the number of thumbnails in each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">The box name of the picture shows whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box file size of the image, you specify whether the file size is displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the picture size check box, you determine if the size of the pictures is displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the subfolder check box, you can set the subfolder with a slider or a rotating field to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the check box to copy original pictures, you specify whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment file check box you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Custom color depth box, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; Settings can be found in & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Window Navigation Pane or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation section of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browser recognition changes a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition, with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & conqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change the browser recognition to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that deny access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE Browser Recognition to access the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set-up browser recognition is used for all pages of the website you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the range of information about the browser used and the operating system in detail.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & conqueror; module, check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; -documents in accordance with the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module website in & konqueror; check the menu under Extras website. you can check the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check whether your & HTML document is the syntax of & HTML; it matches all found errors. with this test you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets that are embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a unified look regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your page to redirect and erroneous shortcuts. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you will find the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web-Archivierer for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and pictures in .html format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click on the Tools website with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed website.</seg>
<seg id="54">The module Web-Archivierer is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik schlager @ iam.unibe.ch larossa malte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& Edit; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitized; easy to use, dozens of professional skills are available. it works completely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion with libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; through the camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam, an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitized; attempts to make reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests.... This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the bug report system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would encourage you to join the user mailing list of & digikam. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we will ask you to answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam site to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digitize; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digitize; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder here. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. this path is saved for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam, you will also use as an AlbenLibrary. Setting Setting Setting Collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures, as a base folder. & digikam, viewing every subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. during browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& dialog; durables recursively the library path in its full depth. you can't exclude sub-folders unless it iste in hidden folders. this allows you to do exceptional & digitized; complete by inserting a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you've configured the base folder, you can go to & digikam; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Cue List to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it can also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set this up and work with raw files is described in the section Roh-Decodersettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfer over the serial port are slow, this connection is meanwhile obsolete. & digitized; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the preview pictures from digitiphoto2. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to go to & digitized; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes came & digitized; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the almine tree, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that you cannot put a picture in words, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to emphasize the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter on the filename works only if it is displayed on the symbol view. which fields can be displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Albensettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was created first.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an album from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album Properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos if you select from the tool bar or sort albums sorted by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The oldest, average, nests buttons: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you open an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlipiquot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As album preview, select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be recycled.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digitized; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. this allows you to avoid using all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can customize the settings, change it. select the albums page and adjust the thumbnail to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse-cursor take a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screen shot at the top of the Introduction section of the main window displays such an auxiliary window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything about & digitized; tags and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can reach all the functions that came with & digiti.You can choose between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the picture editing with a photo by using either F4 Image Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit.... in the Edit section; picture editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by using the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing through other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the image may occur. some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& dialog; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & digitize it will be moved to the garbage dump of & kde; moved. F8 Image deleted or Del. if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumcelstequot; organizes your photos using the data. & digikam, using either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a cue is assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword lipiquot; collapsing so that you can find the keywords that you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported when the database is lost once & digitized; the pictures will be noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on & quot; My keywords; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu appears that gives you the option to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword, drag and drop. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview images and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with an arbitrary number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can assign a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have completed a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window while previewing the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword by using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove From the Tags menu. the menu only displays the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam image shows a time-adjusted histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a timeframe you just have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit. this displays all the associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamp and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next he search box is a small lamp the green will find when the search hits. if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion. after you have saved it, the filter appears in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press the OK button and the search is performed. the results are displayed in My search list in the main window. the Text box Save as is used to select a name in my search list. if you want to change your search again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Search, the form to enter the search appears with the search information previously entered. if you select Advanced search, the dialog for Advanced Search will appear to change your previous search. more information can be found in the section The Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete search from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search options that you can search for in certain fields of & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group, or deleted from it. each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least.... furthermore, you can create searches of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitized; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any image to find a similar. by means of a Schwellert, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere along the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam. find the matching pictures. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down. move it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam, provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl + L to add the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and its window will be opened. if you are again in & digikam, the main window is, you can quickly open the luminaire with L Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview toolbar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you can select a preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the images, then these are also executed in the other image. you can compare the same area of both images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly recalculate from a series of images. if you navigate for pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas. the image on the right is displayed in the right pane. this simplifies to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 file edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right sidebar of the main window is available in the luminaire for both thumbnails. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pan feature that you can see on the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the image, you have to click it and hold the & LMB; both images will show the same image area in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. just use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and forth. this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos results in a form of digital asset management. however, most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to secure, find, protect and use your images. we focus on the process for digital photographers the & digikam. we look at the download, rename, convert, group, archive, optimize, maintain and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes on, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confectioned and exports content which has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is data that can provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will need to find a certain photo without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use & digitized;. the approach to save the metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether other access to your photos should have, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location. the remaining photos will be organized several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will share subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, e.g. versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to be saved in the metadata entry page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to do so, & digikam, provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now assign keywords, captions and an appraisal to each picture. of course, you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata intersect. this is a very rough representation, as each block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to share your photos with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, to have associations, memories, the historical time period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title might be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer to help him about the motive that you moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as lettering. you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time. if you export your images in web galleries, then these lettering will be exported to your wishes into the caption and / or the title of the web-gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocalization are already innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels using pictures with geographic information. & digikam, can also export kml files that you can use with GoogleMaps. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and designates practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digikam, as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's work name. examples can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a stock photo, the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this, in the picture. for private persons, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitized; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, dissemination superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section you are dealing with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated cautious and you can no longer trust them for a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & Dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and keep them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control summation mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a favorable program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-proprieter format. then, read the data again to check you. likewise, please read the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected site. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that media can read.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturing warrants include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks on this topic: disk failure study</seg>
<seg id="187">The most common cause of error, SMART is the most common cause of error, SMART can not detect these errors. some of SMART's detected faults precede the imminent failure. this is particularly read errors and publishing counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also save data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices don't matter much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable result that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and avoids the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember, however, that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. it guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used on your computer, you should take care that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as also by this one overvoltage. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors who also have a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even an failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and run down the system. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in the case of Flickr more. for $25 a year you get unlimited storage, which should only be verified in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are disaster safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are vulnerable to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these faults remain undetected until you one day will open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that use ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">You do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss of notebooks and 46% on the workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lesser damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the broadest file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 stop settings from fundamental physical limitations. this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't blame anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss. so, backup your data frequently to a plan and test this backup before making any dangerous such as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make every day your backup on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, hit a flash you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft suspension: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous to your data. they usually affect a whole space or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential Security: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. it generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made. this backup comes next with the exception that is only scanned and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only rsync the difference of the files that were actually changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach lets you recover and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution might happen manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retained XMP files, original retained, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., usage of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to wallow as a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planed the scalability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was recognized by the system but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBs; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # modifies the size of the file if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, you can create it yourself. this task is easier year-to-year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. however, it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can have relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (Deflate). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG is a royalty-free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the basis of the need to unify the camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace its XML-based XMP technology in 2001 to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, there may be problems when connecting the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format can occur. therefore, you should consider whether you are using DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI Working Groups, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edict, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layered editing, you can use external programs. if you edited the pictures again with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again. these were then truncated by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them into web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam. in the addition of a photo to an album, you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a ferric indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application do not appear on the camera for any file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata Metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam. please note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam. downloading will not delete all photos from their camera and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired ones with the default selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the selected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have been downloaded until now. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the Show all or download the selected folders, a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam, loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by deleting all of them. if you want to delete only a few, you must first select them and then delete the selected delete option.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. you should carefully check whether the photos have been successfully downloaded from the camera before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera viewfinder, you should do so via the camera menu as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often don't use particularly meaningful names as filenames for the photos. this can lead to duplicate filenames, if you load photos from different recording formats into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will automatically be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are done before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the Standard autorifidentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you prefer a different date format than standard format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-% Y% H:% M:% S in the editing area. for further adjustments, you should read the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file names, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digikam, for a photo is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitized; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata page, you can read more details about the information you embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, & digikam, the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was made available, & digikam can be used. these sub-albums are based on the image data. all images with the same date are uploaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras will provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case it stores & digitized; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you must toggle this option. use the Advanced button and select Dateline-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done & digikam. you where the pictures should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. this refers to a position that is specified in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot later, where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam, users who want to locate the location of the photo thus, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, semitor and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and last through the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; do: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs of hairy coordinates, which are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& dialog; tries to give you as much control over its work procedures as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to edit the Edit menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. this allows you to set the default behavior of & Edit; fixed if you click on an entry in the main screen.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. even with a database synchronization these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is synonymous with the author's title: this field should be the photographer's job title. this can be names like e.g. hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the name of the photo. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture to others & quot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC-Felder. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the & digikam database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digitized; imported can be imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded lettering (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitized; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitised; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in a & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions, from & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by clicking the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire from & digikam can be set on this page to the default values. however, when you open the luminaire, these settings are turned on if possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are defined here. in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling refers to the fact that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can turn on the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting Lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just an image viewer for photos. at present, it is rapidly evolving into a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. default is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the skylights, so the parts of your images that are burned in due to the inability of your camera to catch the peak lights as transparent white. to do this, use the setting through white in the settings. the setting colors creates some unusual results, as it shows the pointed-lights in various raisins. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam, and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the lack of green and red portions from the unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option Reconstructing, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam. to keep the time for the demosaicing you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which a matrix of colored pixels is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farming Design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw gives you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. as if AHD Interpolation (Variable Number of Gradient) was used. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue proofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for grading grading as you are carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be returned. there are also LCMS and & digikam. information such as color information from one color space to the other can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Ask if a picture is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Sort the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digikam, this folder will examine them during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility & quot; default squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon that does not contain any color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate as your image would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you print image, because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated. this could be corrected manually, rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for. unfortunately not with the models from Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digikam can support many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will be loaded by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Preferences.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get through the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata into or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand show a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set the camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window's menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Conversion dialog for moving &gt; Display pictures in the trash bin, you can customize the dialog from & digikam; when you delete a photo in an album, you will find further details in the sections deleting a photo and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly by & digikam; apply if you use the option Changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen from & digikam. under certain circumstances this will speed up the start-up of & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting Beim Start after new photos is forcing & digitizing; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something was deleted from the base folder, & digikam. you know if it is to delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be edited in & dialog; used to customize the main window to your taste. you can select these settings in Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& Edit; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to edit and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a series of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting up the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. none of the features will however change the original photo before you have saved the file Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by reproducing from the File menu or using the Restore button in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image editing can be reversed or restored. you can undo the last action by resetting resetting or recovering by selecting Edit Reset from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press a moment longer via the return or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be undone or restored in between.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, down picture or the entries in the File menu. if you've made any changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out where you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: select magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change it in the dialog from & digikam. you can view it from the Edit menu; view the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the Standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single images or entire sentences. entire image preview pages can be printed out of your selection. you just have to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the Menu album Export Print Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar on the right, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, also available in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab makes the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible, which means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied into the EXIF and IPTC- fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are deformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this button you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this will always be done if you have selected a metadata setting which is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating indicates a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency, which follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword-tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this & digitised session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you typed different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to add a keyword to a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - Date, keywords and searches. if one or more key words filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">Suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is set on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Strg + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword-tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched on under Options Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have created and created a rule and find it to be one or more, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry you are looking for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of image processing workflows. additionally, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. additionally, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are via email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calliate my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to callibrillate your monitor, since sRGB is based on sRGB. if you work as an RGB colour space, you either need to calibrate your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Compare and Contrast Expand from the Correcting Automatic correction try to make the best of your colors. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the beam intensity values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the luminous intensity of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light borders and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the largest range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam, is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited to a color space of 8-bit per color. if you are therefore too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be customized in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original image again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the top right there is a histogram shown that changes dynamically once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide if any of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved into a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button restores all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings may result in another photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computational time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult chapter Colour Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under Colors Sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar radiation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that came into being when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to fine adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase finally generates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvia's highly saturated colours, however, are also a few photographs, especially those that have hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the thickness of the neon light. in case of large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can try to experiment the various color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you do a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you can perform can be previewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma the tool is positioned to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complex, you need only the range of the sliders for the purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into and shifted to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controls and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right you can see the original and the preview of the image. the preview is updated dynamically using the image settings. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input parameters of the shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, compression of the output values can be used to create a faded picture as background while something else is to be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and later loaded again. to this end, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between linear and logarithmic views. for images taken with a digital camera, linear mode is mostly the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve part to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you created can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if detected in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digitized; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the Color channel mixer for image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the colour for histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as a comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. when you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: control for red, green and construction permit you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the picture will retain the general brightness as well, because the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from color-brewing. color-brewing consists of small noise-artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear differently in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can save you for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance preserve is activated. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, because color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Plus</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good at all scene patterns and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves sceneries, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. thus similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithonite: creates warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shatter tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and the re-development in a sepikeoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cocin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digiplug; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. continuous surround the picture with a colored line, Niepce denounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), rounded it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any location. this also works at several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply insert the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the bigger the image, the bigger the character set will be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digiplug; apply the tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam, please send an email in English to the & digikam mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button "base folder" in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil. selecting a folder will automatically update the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this knob decreases the image underneath. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you have to resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. to do so, take the image and position it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychoeducational. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a colour point. this in turn causes blurred edges to be combined into a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpness. images in raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool suit. you can call this using the menu item Correcting sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal prudently, since the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. generally, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you can refocus it using the menu item Correcting. below refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the soft sign tool with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or amount amplifies the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge is affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount is applied. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference with it to apply for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharpening and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred blurred was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected development filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fold is much better than the Gauß 'sche fold. the Gauß' sche fold has a very long tail, which leads to this the mathematical result also depends on the source pixeles, which are far from the original pixels. the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular fold. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is extremely blurred, but then pay attention to the icons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, eg; 0 the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 'sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring is incorrect. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unlike zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauss. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any more focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that a lot of operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible, but will leave unpleasant artifacts later on.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurring masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masks always have to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of blur. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for the correction of sharpness in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothness regulator sets the sharpness of the area darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Level of detail p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and make details sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence alpha [0,100]: a small value smooths evenly in all directions, while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD images, a high value will generate wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles create a long run-time. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected using small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artifact created during the journey. the original image is shown under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on digital cameras sensor noise, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow Details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blur the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter is looking forward to determine luminance changes. you may need to re-adjust the edges filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or smithing occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically more blurry, but also the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjusting of the phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges. it can remove noise spikes and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool for softening with the menu entry Correcting plasticizers and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam, photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a loss-prone compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefact quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Been.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is shown under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixels from photos that have been deleted with a CCD camera gem, eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem in high-quality raw mode, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file to the wizard with the dark image. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you connect the dark image directly to detect new hot or light pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will detect the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark image and automatically recharges it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square turns (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction using a color photo from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitized; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not light the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignetting & quot; (shaded) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes the necessary shutter speed so high that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses, also with Center filters, should use an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise irregularities are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposing ranges of today's film and color or grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter. the tool Vignettierungscorrection removes the transformation with a Centerfilter. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the vignetting correction filter and three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of maximum density. the standard density is 2,0, which compensates an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a luminous intensity of 2. reduce the density by a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree to compensate.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want finer realignment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Edit menu; picture editing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a Leuchstärke- and contrast-correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitized; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth grading corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two you can almost eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the inverted parameter of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scales the image size and results in a correction of first gradient. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tone or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tone-like correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tine / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transformers blanking from image editing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tone-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives, such as photos from the front, frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org web page which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area to preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can see the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Show movie kernels if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller alters the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture below (2) to be seen. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver granules of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere loosened from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photo, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the standard value is, although frequently higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film particle effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitized; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitized; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machined is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitized; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage sketch. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you have chosen to outline you.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; Filter Gravity shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stacked in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitized; Filter Gravure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important one. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelengths 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wavelengths 2: analogous to the wavelengths 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time by pressing the exit button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Zoom: blurred the image along star shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Blurring: blurred the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurb the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blurring: blurred the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shutter blurring: blurred the image by means of random displacement of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basins in the picture and blurb it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the picture into rectangular cells and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button Been.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives your images a wet look. it uses a copyrighted algorithm inspired by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drip. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can do with the & digikam; image processing an area free of raindrops. to do so, use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. you can find the tools in the menu Transformers Turning or transforming Reflection.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information again? the CImg algorithm used here makes it a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size change in menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the size tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool for blowing.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitized; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo blown was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintaining the aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each stoness for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast in what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Been.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo blown by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cropping of a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. the image processing allows this very easy. to cut a photo you just have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. you can drag a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button for image editing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl + + X). use the File Save or Save File menu item in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the higher value of the height and the transverse format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool by aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in dialog you can use the Max. relation button to set the area for cutting to the widest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are saved as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help make it possible to show help so that you can better put your images together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elebreins, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle with a similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division that relies on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have been using the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos to achieve. compared to the 3rd elregel, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's view along the line of the spiral and creates on this way a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to make the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, in contrast to harmonious triangles, gold triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal on these lines can be published a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break up your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digitized; picture editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. by button Preferences, you can set the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot an image, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformers blanking out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatically trimming function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothing the picture a bit after rotation. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically computed. on the right-hand side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New Width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top left: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle Left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image will be a little lubricated. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformation trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal shear for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle turns into a parallelogram. you can start this module via Transformers scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Drag your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can shoot horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shot, this effect is mostly negligible, but two insulations make twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitized; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphs are used in science, particularly in computer science. graphs are used in science, particularly in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that are & graphiviz; included, are according to the program author obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphinter; is a KDE program for viewing & graphiviz; -dot; -graphs. the & Graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphs; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; on. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate; the graph is re-calculated and in & kgrapher; represented)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or open the graph in & kgraphviewer; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from around 1000 knot and a hack to present more than this node)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphiviz; -Tool & dot; for displaying graph presupposed. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the open graph, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file currently loaded in & kgraphviewer; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later also will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can configure the menu item Settings kgraphviewer; set..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a running & kgraphviewer; instance, and in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphiviewer; instance, or to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">With the program start you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be divided on several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page are to be fitted to this page. in doing so, the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphs distributed across multiple pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Shop page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk & eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can specify a default behavior in this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraphviewer; you can specify a default behavior (the files of the last session open or not) or decide to be asked at each start.</seg>

<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphiviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the & graphiviz website, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs. the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for uncoated graphs. it produces images according to the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm produces a springspring model layout for unerived graphs. it uses the Fruitman pure gold heuristic, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm orders the node circular according to the description of Six und Tolli, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell. the command should specify the graph file as a parameter, and give the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify special options, or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (aimed or ungerified) and turns the default algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for unerified graphs).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module includes tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select here the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by selecting the default values ducrhe in order to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have clicked the button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting the Import &gt; Screen photo... menu. a window appears where you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have picked up the complete desktop, only the window is read in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other desktops you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been created, the dialog box appears with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module calendar does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please contact the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the internet. with Flickr it is possible to send your photos to the people that are important. you can show your favorite photos in the world, display the photos of your mobile phone online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and your family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export Module to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this will be used for your authentication. so, it is your ID to Flickr. a browser is launched to allow you to login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed to Yes, you will see the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exports to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. for uploading you need write permissions. the module does not currently support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">Button Photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button start uploading the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the picture as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set access permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option Changes the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value entered in Maximum Size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Gallery Export Module is a tool for exporting your image collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Gallery export now has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please contact the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF key words of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for localizing pictures geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsone can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears. to perform a possible correlation between time and location, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file naturally contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera zone. if the deviation is below the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have matching dates. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog shows the coordinates of a call to the next one you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do this, select the region concerned and increase sie.Run this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the map can always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool uses to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the Choice allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you select the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth, which naturally affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails, which are small images that are shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred while generating. the web browser will automatically be started at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found, for example, in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Digital Camera Client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation at this moment. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please contact the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the KIPI mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all picture formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool for converting a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a basic picture transition. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you have to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, high, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be adjusted next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the mpeg file. keep in mind the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings according to your wishes, you can use the Kode button to start the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or easily enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button at the bottom right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance are to be used. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for that.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. however, this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starcode and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. for this purpose four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional scale in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your favorite email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before. more images can drag and drop to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you selected. you can add more pictures using the button Images. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the New message window of your email client with the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to send. it may be possible to send a good idea to multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format in the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you to JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Slideshow module, a window with questions like your slideshow will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by means of OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the file name of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images, the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. the best distance, however, depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, every transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please contact the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module wallpaper is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the sub-menu, as background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can with & kphotoalbum; through these browses, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, now in each group, so in people, places and in the group keywords entries present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have added your images and videos with annotations. additionally there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are shown on which both persons can be seen. by using this selection method, you can restrict the number of images shown in a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">Each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to locations, keywords and other categories you have defined.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your words).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual. in order to do this, you must select the image-view window (described in more detail) and select the corresponding person in the context menu. in the view window, you can customize the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you call the Find Find dialog in the main window, a dialog is displayed which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the labeling or description field, the captions and descriptions of the images will be searched for that text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can search all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals but rather want to try some functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo when you start & photoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; -Demo. then, some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, please refer to the & kphotoalbum homepage; as a contiguous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview pane from the database (if you select a date, the first picture will display this date in the preview window) and also the time line always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timestamps. if you select an area, you will see in the preview screen only pictures of that time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images. the one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version described, which you can create through the File menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas contents, layout and destination. in the following each section is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the surviving and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether to create a & kphotoalbum; export file that is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information displayed to the viewer without description. for example, that all pictures are of a party. note that & kphotoalbum; at the moment all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more pictures, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so you can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time. if he wants to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, set the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to specify the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created is started. otherwise, the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. so the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name will set you in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you may want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you need to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others to your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the File menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files are searched. this is, of course, only possible if you created your .kim file by means of HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting images that you can export through the Export... menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manual option to copy to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folder the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to import (if you are a domain) while this category is called by your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the file to be importing and which categories match them in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. you can see an example of this in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you see pictures of your holiday trip and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the various steps of (1) Specifying the information about your images, about (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal Backup tools, to a diskette or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remember the folder where your images are stored and automatically restores it with future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; i.e., another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">The menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of & photoalbum; in the next section of the user manual, you will explain the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols, with which you can view the preview options and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options section, sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up entire member groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in this section.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list box above you can select the category you want to configure. in the left part of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digitiam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can be called via the Module menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access through the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbums; therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before you use them on your own images. demo database can be used either via command line with the &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, whereby it may be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications do not support their images in albums. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulating & photoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all images that you can see at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here, & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum; so do so, so whether you would have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbums are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select which modules to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are familiar with it from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and a tool bar at the top. at the moment, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but click on the pictures below to show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">Here you can see three lists with a text box by setting persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are pictured, you can find that the names used are moved upwards to find and assign persons more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case simply click the above and back buttons below the picture to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these images and to use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. besides, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a sub-group. to show you that this is a sub-group, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally, you can easily drag an entry into a category and place it there to make it an subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and dragging the bar that forms the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to view this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the Show images in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have a filter. an example of this can be found here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you haven't opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can also use pictures without having saved you on the hard disk. of course, you need to have the images stored somewhere to record & photoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut, are not saved on the hard disk. however, the thumbnails are present for the images 1-9. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present; however, you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back. & kphotoalbum; therefore, it does not support you to ask for the inserting of the CD concerned. so, if you want to avoid anger, like the mess of your images, please buy a larger hard disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, simply filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible to others and click Instant view in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister can see and bar the menu item All except up-to-date view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have defined which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, so that all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again shown, click on the lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand all images on the hard drive and on the other, anyone can access the file index.xml to read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection serves only to forbid those who with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to look at private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to view them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; using a picture _ and video viewer. these can be started from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered into the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox is on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is available at all. all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see matching entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from your browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image above and below image. you can jump to the first and final image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it can load a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can zoom in and zoom in. to zoom in, you can simply move a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key you can zoom out The Plus key zooms in in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the key, the zooms function, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos show in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotary functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make annotations to the current image using the menu item Notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you view images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can cancel the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name. however, you might prefer to preview only the picture and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you view them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters. in the picture you see an image with characteristics A, B and C.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set characteristics on your images, they are available to you in the browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply complete all of them at once with annotations. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you can display categories in the special preview, then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you allow & kphotoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to switch on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; do not fully master, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message is displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to the & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -Reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on thumbnail preview and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a sub-arranged element. if you want to render only a part of the texture (e.g. a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map), check out local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the Visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also save multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under one view, pull the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, pull the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, pull the beginner on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left at the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the beginning bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you can find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View Window arrangement... Save. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it render. & kpovray; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 is up-to-date. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render mode... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can type any name, but useful is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the cross section subsection and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination-field quality you can select the properties that use & Povray; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling covers the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptiv-recursively; recursively because every pixel is split and adaptively because the recordable depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel passes the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further tracked and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process, called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for rendering quality is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent then if the associated beams have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window to display the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; to import the scene, select the Import menu file... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click help in the property view, click & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object capture of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross High degree of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this property results in a better approximation for the projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you view a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is shown in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is shown in a chessboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and threshold value can be set. in the section Render modes you can find exact details on the parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window orders section, explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination box Standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The new window. with New Column, create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten anchored the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating anchored the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have straight & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: one ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. especially note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the Enter key, the wiremodel views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a jader (insert infinite body crossfader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model-view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite finite level. when you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look closely at the object tree, you will notice that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to the exercise a unit below the horizons, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, where you can select how to insert the object. please choose the first item. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the preview button see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment is just a matte black material because you need to enter the settings for the pigment yet. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on the preview. also, there are many options now, but now take the simplest one.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the box and the ball in the preview, click on the Apply button and then go to the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now properly set. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you have expected. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called one color. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree every time you select and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to execute this step because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you should already have understood the ball as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button) so that the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now makes a weird result: as you can see before, the ball surface looks like a matte black material. in the following step, set up a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of gloss effect and reflection sometimes result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metal is not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoot hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray reflects and breaks through the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect. thus, the scene pixels are processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Reproduces the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reverted command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Resin.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can change or add commands to & kpovmodeler with this option; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. with this option you can add and remove toolbars for & kpovmodeler; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface, without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic geometries are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these baskets. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can display by clicking the & LMBs button or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a particular file, simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file is highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as & Amarok; short commands work. this makes your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, most of which can also be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of the collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options from Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Start require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can replace data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; any KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. to this end, the function exec () is usually used. this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Soft the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started Amarok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signifies that a new piece is played. the script could now & zb; use DCOP functions to query more information about the new piece (such as metadata or piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume ensures a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contain the path to the selected files in the playlist, when a user defined menu entry is clicked. to add an entry to the menu, you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, clearing up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user and zb have downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as e.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amaroks script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exiting amarocscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is complete, you can download it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script page of & Amarok; for your entry to kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; script.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok requires only the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. so you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will, for example, cause difficulties. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the Taglib library for days. you can locate the file by going to ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file causing the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is somewhat mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries of & Amarok; used libraries are compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate automatically. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open during a crash). if it is a frequent crash and send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta information, but they are not labelled as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: symbol lookup error: amarocapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixERK7QPixmap, please check if Amarok uses the correct qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some ways. most installation problems are best explained by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the Channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please note that there is only one error, if something is due to the correction of an error in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only a blank playlist appears. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the Start subwindow was converted to the Statistics window. you can find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field to filter the collection facilitates the search for certain pieces. if you are content with the playlist, you can save it with the help of the button Playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. when the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the option to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right-click on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed that make work with & Amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you will also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; It offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any regular multimedia player also has & Amarok; a player window with the most important features. in addition, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to everyone else. the Playlist window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how to use all the functions of & Amarok; including the creation of a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream. just below is the area, the game time, bit rate and sample rate of the current piece. a click on this section changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifiable window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ button can also be found under the scroll bar. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece positional slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start playing / stop and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own pre-settings.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use the Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click on the EQ button in the Player window. once you select the equalizer box, the Equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player, but don't be deterred by the wealth of features they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be split into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist itself is easy to use, yet even for advanced users.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser styles. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three sub-windows will be explained in detail later.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used previous versions of & Amarok; perhaps you may notice that the subwindow is dropped off. the information shown there is now divided into other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistical window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow shows information about the currently running piece as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover image of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to track the piece in the Musicbrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the Musicbrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browsers will also display cover images, which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer. this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can specify which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if you don't have a text script yet, you can choose which one to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then saved in & Amarok's collection database. no running text script is required to do this.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping artist - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Group Interpret / Album - First the pieces will be arranged according to artist and below will be a further division after the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Different Interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Artist / Year - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by one another. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings for the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically rerecord your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. you can find hints to use this filter in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The search filter contains a selection box that allows you to filter the recently added pieces to your collection, starting from the last 24 hours to one year. in addition, you can of course select your entire collection, whereby the filter is practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Attach the selected pieces of the current playlist. double click on an entry to reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this way you will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as playlists. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the waiting queue for transmission to the media player. see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files into the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark it as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Highlighting up selection - Modify the album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. after that the album is no longer displayed under different interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes handling many playlists very easy, including smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. this uses & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Smart Playlists to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, it must be included before starting & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, find the pieces on your iPod according to artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the required tracks from the playlist and drop them to the Artist list. when you're done, click Apply. this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. when the commit is finished, finish & Amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you find a address bar with which you can pick music from a given URL. if you enter the example tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press Enter key, you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping the Shift key. in this case, holding the Shift key can be helpful. in this case, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired place. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter delimited search terms with spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. if you enter for example one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">When you enter OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will look for entries that Mike Oldfield does not include, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50th This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you would like to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword, set a minus sign prior to the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you wish. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that include either Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of records by holding the Ctrl key pressed, and then right-click on the entries. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button you can add to the playlist. to the right of it, you will find playlists, Empty Playlists and Random Mixer.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow the undo and restore buttons. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, enlarged analyzer. the refresh rate can be set to the analyzer by clicking the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you want to display in the player window over the right mouse button. via this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example, playback control and volume control. you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and setting up Toolbars there... select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. in addition, the status for random mode and repeat play can be changed easily by double clicking with the mouse in the appropriate display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar flag in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. via this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok;</seg>
<seg id="1404">Click on this entry to open the Visualization Plugins window. there you can select the visualisations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry you find a submenu with links to this document and other information on & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move into & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, the playlist appears in the playlist next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are pre-set (the details to set up these later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces during playback.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on load .fm recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want, drag it to the playlist window, or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Load. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two preset modes of Random Mix and Playlists Mix instantly populate your playlist and you can start playing directly. the recommended pieces will start with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added to the next unit change, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, activate the latest possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic Mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. using the same menu entry, the dynamic mode can also be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New button refills the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode. edit Playlists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">With a right-click on a dynamic playlist, you have the option to click Edit. then, the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist here. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist, so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece. if you set more than 1, the playlist will grow continuously, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right have already been described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog, you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you cross multiple playlists, & Amarok will add random pieces from each of the playlists that have been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts make your own settings possible. you can customize the settings by booting the script and then clicking on Setting.</seg>

<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described above the What is the? -help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful if you have files for a multi-session CD. it is intended for you rather than help, so that you can view the files and folders already available on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & k3b to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD copy dialog. this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively, you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">It also allows you to create only one copy of a DVD, which you can then burn sometime later. in addition, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. in addition, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. furthermore, the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW, so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW drive.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), which makes the content completely erased. & k3b; lets you choose between the writing modes overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog will prompt you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the submitted media. this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains characteristics of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is ticked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Table of Contents allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header does not have any real function, it looks pretty and separates the projection screen from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change keystrokes for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keyboard mapping to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator privileges are required, so you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is intended for personalising and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP interface. using this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line or the more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of your task will be decisive, which of the accompanying programs will give you densely.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you are using the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void addurl (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void addurl (KURL:: list urls, Qstring parent) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring Newname) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on hard disk) and from many encoders that encode these WAV files (compressing). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (these encoders have to be added from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders have to be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions but it is probably not necessary to install some of them yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer provides a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog has to be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily use to read a & CD is explained later on. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, all of which is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the step by step example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">(this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an Encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default. it must be noted that before the Encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, beeps) for program events (such as read & CD; quit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main Configuration dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different cards (such as Encoder, for setting the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such 'shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important because both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto hi-fi systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate app 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate app. 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by youths, portable devices and auto accessories. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or automatically fetched from freedb via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / used with & kaudio creator; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; add title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudio creator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information, so that all others can download this information instead of itself into the computer. it's worth noting that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (editor's note: with this the author is meant) am not lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being hurt by the & CD; there is also information without the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway by a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator, actively select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio creator is set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirroring server will be needed. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added to this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoder. more information on Kodierer is available in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD; to do so, check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; read lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine because it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is / usr / share / cd and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy it into it with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & audio creator; something that is probably done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each broadcast & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used to compression the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the freedb to use the & CD; download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be able to change them during each readout of a & CD; if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be passed to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card list General Settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only for incomplete information, so that you will be informed if information is missing to generate keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map menu CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server during the reading of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry found, immediately begins reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filename or tag entries resulting from it. the directory and file name is changed with Konqueror &gt; tags and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database before. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org side and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, since many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send any data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously missing pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, so simply try themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1566">After reading the last piece: check this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is on average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 tags may also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic set up of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each departing & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data cleared for a & CD; therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually, instead of fetching them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this hasn't happened yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; can be identified as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then search the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully obtained from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are filled in and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there, a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry that is best suited to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but retrieve the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current titles' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field of the album can be used for individual comments, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. all words with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously consistent with the style of the issuing CD; in this example, this is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off. make sure all pieces are selected or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the selection button to read the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control jobs. the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen if you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occured right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in the case of weak machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with a AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of course two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. and 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at persons compiled by source files and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different map flashcards and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still to read? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any reference point like it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaokespieler of & kde; besides others, it has real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts as well as some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS maps. alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the song text on the screen with changing color so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session Support. when you stop playing a song while playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it will appear the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; drop windows into the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button on the toolbar, select the play from the play menu or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you click it on the & kmid; (for several pieces, they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as you play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two functions: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item pause in the play menu, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text, others use lyrics, and some other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so you don't need to manually adjust the text. so, if you select the Automatical Text option in the Settings menu, you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type fixed, select text events and / or property events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played back in series. in this section you can see how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the Collection Manager first. you can find it in the menu item under the item Organizing.... Click here to New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then giving the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember, if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you need to be selected in the Collection Manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu sequence of the menu Collections, the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the Collection Manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Former piece, the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow left arrow.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter because it is not stored when you leave & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of Change patch to Bright Piano in the event of the Change patch to Trumpet type and always lets a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all GM sound cards are compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS maps, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Keymap"... END Define keymap "A further key map..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches from General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so do not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard, for example, does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gammshot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch refers to where each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how notes are mapped on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keypads for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to map notes on the percussions channel. take a look at the provided keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap with the name name is used for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The Pitch Bender ratio value indicates in what ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard that gets a pitch-benefit event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards are trying to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a complete set of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played right now.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. view in the Settings menu under the item channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">So, for example, if you find a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all the files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. just open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First of all, enable Automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default speed you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop open & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, simply switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to quickly listen to a file without adding it to a collection, turn on the Automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so, set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.Q. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga. I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have a lot of spare time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They really make me happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will get in contact with friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid, written entirely in my spare time and I don't get any money from anyone. I would like to stress that I only need to continue programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Wtheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks go to all these excellent musicians on the web that give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can be found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view images. you can also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM instrument or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it works as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not listen to any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& SMB; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category persistent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy. when you click an entry, the group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can do this only if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMplayers /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & SPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Animation during start and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 oblast option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable another animation. & SMB; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml; the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. however, this would be bothersome in the end animation, so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of your favorite photos: & lt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; img dur = "incorrectly" src = "file: / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; In directory tests / some examples of SMIL are supported by & KMplayers.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path can be set from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of SMB. this is where the output of mplayer is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerc, such as setting the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swf dec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SMB; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignment of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">Konqueror or & SMB; can be started in a console application and searched for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors here, the backend issue is within & SMB; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To get a given backend for a particular Mime type (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be looked, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) Settings in the SMB, the dialog can be used in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the code to use must be found (e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of SMB only can use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by SMB for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these are dvdnaval, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom will be run as user root after binding the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure / dev / cdrom drives to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and to learn its options, the manual can be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start working with the editor of & kate directly there with reading the chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right pronunciation: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, can also use a Laie (close) & latex; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview on & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book about it. to be able to master properly, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other recording languages contains & latex; an introduction with which the most common properties like paper format, page numbering and text gratification are specified as well as a body with text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ 'documentclass, the body starts with the command\\' begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) provides some possibilities for creating the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: hereby, the type of document to be created is: articles (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [report], article (DIN) [scrartcl], book (DIN) [scrbook], projector [beamer], film [prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: hereby the encoding of the system is set. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Articles (DIN), Book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the documentation classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). they should always be used when preparing German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it's just a short description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - just like other source code editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you are seeing graspberry areas of a green text on the screen, it is very likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic failover of the environment, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ beginning {command}) of & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the associated line to lock the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu Setting... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the document to be divided into the following elements (part is the most common and the most subtle element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating a DVI; file [right-dependent file]], jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font and is besides PDF the standard output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the image search, the elements of DVI; file with the editor are plucked and once clicked to an element in the DVI; the pre-search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex; source code has been clicked, the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is based on thermo-nderungenâ and it does not call from & eyepiece; after fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be displayed. the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for quick outline of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -instructions for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Further is for inserting items such as Tags, notes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a section, a picture or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified name (selection above a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file is hung to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are appropriate editors necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files may also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ ss is used for determining the font size. it enables the font Ã © s for the main text, the notes notes etc. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and placing the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ 'documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code sample has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or the button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; for storing automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document is not compiling, it should be searched for errors in the logging process. when using Quick Construction, the eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (close environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} allows for the change of the fonts in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only considered within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, there may be certain fonts, bold print, italics, submissions, etc. these commands end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be represented italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">The background for writing the source code with the & latex; markup language is now followed by a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text is entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. to do this, there should be a quote, a few passages in the fat and italics pressure and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a constant file format (D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as necessary for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source text has been created, the conversion can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search option allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. you just need to set up Modern under Settings box...</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to select the preferred search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked to pre-search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer is then done sothen.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -Statement by & Kile; Open and jumped to the corresponding line. for this, & box; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (Setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you do not open the & DVI connection, a bug is available. if an error is present, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file will explain the source code in the source text. in the editor, the buttons can be used for proverbs between errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the error line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the button is clicked on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to use for the document. the pre-set options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from the ground up or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document. more information on this can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">High-income users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template by pressing an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can choose your own template rather than the default one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any and latex; files created in an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described in the following steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and its options, the manual can be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start working with the editor of & kate directly with the reading of the chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called via the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double click with a pressed Ctrl key to select the word & tex; this means that by clicking on\\ par with\\ par\\\ bigskip, only\\ par will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button pressed, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and highlight these. for example, the & latex; -commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump tokens. this is a special type of bookmark within the text. the menu items Edit klsprings or the corresponding button keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted by this jumping record, so that it is automatically deleted during the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & kate; already excellent possibilities offered, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code has been added; special commands for selection. under Edit Settings, the following commands for text selection are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with consistent lines (like in other text editors). this extended meaning closes with tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only bent thing in & Kile; is that the paragraphs are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains & latex; -commands with a round line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Cate; provides the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Cate; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Deletes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile provides; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lock the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor happens before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, the cursor is jumped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the view over can quickly be lost. this command closes the recently opened environment, so that the nested ambient structure is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special orders for the & latex; groups that are determined by {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those of Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command we jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the braces of a & tex; -group #, the cursor is jumped to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested pair-braces, the overview can quickly be lost. this command closes the recently opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotation marks are used as guest feeds. for the purposeful implementation, the sign is used in & Kile; the sign is used for two simple quote characters. also for the end of the quote, the sign is used. & Kile; knows this case and has two concluding quotation marks for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of double quotation marks can be set up in Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g. german or french) and thus German or French quotation marks. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment, t & Kile closes; the current line with\\\\ associated with a subsequent line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set up under settings box; set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and all Et signs (amp;) among each other. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tab in the above line. even though this tab is not the one added, add & Kile; some space for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already offers a good source code completion, it has been added in & Kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;) still extended. three of these work on demand and the other two are set for automatic adjustment. all of these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings box...</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the button, the last letter of the input is removed and it is possible to grate the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, von & Kile; also jumping nets can be inserted, so that a jump to these positions can be possible by editing jump brands NÃ ¤th trampoline and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; complete, settings can be made to these lists. there can be different lists of wishes for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as widening of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin, and the call of the complete digging mode will result in a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are so often used that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full disk space above the menu item Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment automatically is opened and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient comprehension can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is closed automatically. as soon as & Kile sees it is a list environment, a first\\ item command is even added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; complete, settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of termination mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of cuts, which are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under settings box... and can be set up fully. as an example of a drop-down list, the file example.cwl is used, for example, the L =\\ LaTeX entry.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word Processing Mode is introduced over the menu Edit Batch Conversion or Ctrl + Alt Space key, the letter L will be replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large-scale breakers are not helpful for automatic processing. however, it has been found that many users in a document are written more than once. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written users.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu box... Kile can be disabled completely. here, too, the threshold value can be set for the display of the completion.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nlichen Home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics are designed as easy as possible. to view the basics of the graphics formats, the sections should be followed and followed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as familiar as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are grouped in the menus, compilation, converting and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the subsequent conversion can be used the keyboard key Alt; 2. after that, the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file by Alt; 4 using the old; 4 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick structure command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window is opened each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the project New Project.... Here you will find the following information for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When rolling the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>

<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= Kile) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a large number of additional packages. & Kile; offers a lot of different tools to support the users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are supplied with many documents. it contains documentation for the included packages and a further & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A complete Refernz for & tex; and its eâ like Freindeâ. it is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but is therefore ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & Kile; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the quantity of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; it is not always easy to find the right document. as a possible help, & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk, which contains a database with all the documents and boxes; provided documents and herein a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or tags. von & Kile; only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& Kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed & kde; working area environment. & Kile; is also part of the Fink project, whereby & Kile; also on & Mac; can be executed with installed OS-X.</seg>

<seg id="1893">The dialog can be closed by pressing X in the right upper corner of the window. if the settings are changed, open the dialog again.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Once the style sheet is started, the Debugging Stage manager menu can be selected. then click on the tab at the tab, as in the example below.</seg>
<seg id="1895">A file name can be an absolute path to a local file. or only the file name (eg; xsldoc.xsl).</seg>
<seg id="1896">A template or model name can be a fully qualified name, where the non-local part is optional, such as xsl: mytemplate is also referred to as a mytemplate.</seg>
<seg id="1897">First click the stop point to delete in the list of the current holding points. then press the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1898">The status of a certain holding point is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color. the desired color can be selected: see the EditorSettings dialog, on the page Colors.</seg>
<seg id="1899">You can set, deactivate or delete a holding point using the buttons, the Debug menu or the icons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Most of the output from & kxsldbg; will be captured and either in the stage management... dialog or in & kxsldbg; output window shown. the following exceptions apply from this rule:</seg>
<seg id="1901">The various tools are available through the Debugger menu, where the stage-management tool is most important.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Clicking the step-by-step guide in the menu will display a dialog for choosing the speed.</seg>

<seg id="1909">If the Inspections dialog does not appear, select Debugger Inspire... from the menu. to edit the sources, click on the source tab in the resulting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1910">All found templates are listed here. it must be noted that the export rules of & XSLT apply. therefore, multiple templates can be present with the same agreement and mode details.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Clicking on a template in the list shown moves the text cursor in the main window to the corresponding line of this file.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Local and global variables are shown on a map in the dialog Xsldbg inspector. the following example shows XSLT source code in which a global and a local variable is declared</seg>
<seg id="1913">By clicking on a variable from the list you get a summary information in the dialog below. if a variable has a particular expression, for example</seg>
<seg id="1914">If it contains, then a new XPath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button.</seg>
<seg id="1915">When clicking on a variable entry in the list, the text pointer in the main window will be moved to the corresponding line of this file.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all of these tools use comm as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as base. the combination results in fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Anyone who worked with the & kde; documentation knows myproc and how superior it is. if we raise it a bit, we give it a graphical interface! no more on a terminal, simply clicked on the symbol for the XML processor and finished!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is located in the desired working folder, then leave the current working folder attached. if not, then remove the selection of current work folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files will be deleted every time myproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already said everyone who has worked at the & kde; documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; there is now a great graphical interface for this.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the newly opened file is index.docbook, then simply select the current job folder. if not, then select the current job folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">When it comes to an output on the screen, its file is flawed. please check the reported error and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus; then the current file is simply checked. if not, delete the tick in the current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the file well-formed is, click the Well-formed review selection.</seg>
<seg id="1925">To use a & DTD; specified in the & XML; file, select & DTD (default), otherwise & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the & DTD; by definition-URI; file selection. both for the & W3C; & XML; schema as well as for the RelaxNG check is the definition of the definition URI; in the file selection is required.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; also has a & XSL; -processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">If the file to be processed in & quantaplus; already selected, then the current file is simply selected. if not, remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed by the other file file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Enter the name of the file as the result should have named, and the file is normally stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plugins, the & quantaplus; ladet, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plugin system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in & quantaplus; the plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a KPart, we start editing plugins to the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location used & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several individuals in a sort of hierarchical relationship. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and serves to uniquely identify.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears in bold after which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be an event for information sent to the team leader when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing the project so that later you can see how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that initiates a file to the CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page Event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter notes is simple. either the note entry from the editor context menu can be selected or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by annotation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (Role), where nickname is the assigned nickname of the team member, is part of the project from the following possibilities: the respective area or sub-project names should be given as shown in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD-agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the other can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting Quanta... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lower case of tags: large / lower case of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means, the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / Small writing of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal bulk / lowercase means that the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically lock: if checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional, will be inserted immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags, except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and end tag: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Default button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here will be stalled from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Default DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting here will be stalled from the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly, so that the document can be recovered from this backup in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file. also for unsaved documents, backup is generated regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in its own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is changed by modifying the MDI modes and dock / append views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message section serves to control the display of warnings by enabling no longer prompting.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL- and the source view in shared mode. see the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the illustration of the parser nodes in the document can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure Tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree in the editing and how deeply to change the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty knots are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plugins can be managed. plugins are KPart-applications from the third page, which can be reused by any KPart-capable application, the most well known & conqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plugin if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "Only-Read mode" mode: check if the plugin refuses to load. only-Read-Kparts refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, test & quantaplus; whether the entered information is correct. unselect allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations across plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it shares the plugin with, to listen to debug claims. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server for a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debug is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution continues. if it happens before a request is made, the execution begins once a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where possible with functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg, which can be found at http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you can and quantaplus; help get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; used to provide support for markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / etc. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folders are handy, symbol orientated strips of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user may ever have.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details to convert.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day displays. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars allow quick inserting tags into a document without danger of a typewriter.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folder. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the descriptive language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information about working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in an easy way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only happen once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than the element type itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a merely element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only be used once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc. this is a merely element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill in the attributes in tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tag name%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that brings together the elements of a list. it can only happen once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (i.e. one for each field; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a merely element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that terminate a tag. this element is a merely element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be chained and closed properly.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; character. these should be replaced by & lt;, particularly in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and review TagXML. a more dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the check only takes place when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following one example for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; loading function is described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tags &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor, accessible via DTD Edit DTD settings. this can be edited by diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings.... click New Action to open the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking on the Custom button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered into the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, try & quantaplus; $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file will be removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is added unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can input & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the exported application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, directed to the standard output; error messages, to the default output output. it can be specified, which is to be done with the output written on the standard output by setting the input field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a separate toolbar for each group. in any given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure promotions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all required fields and add the tag to the right toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and plan their use, enable "Edit the Tag" when available so that it is possible to input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphic other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green most of the time will be interpreted as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least send a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; -functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the toolbar setting dialog by Settings Toolbars. make sure the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to preview the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all symbols to ensure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the correct folder. after New eXML does not exist, it is created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that your tool bar (s) is loaded (will) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation to the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. first, let's let you know the second one we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in main index Top element = your description for this documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = Section1.html sec2.= Sec2.1.html tag2 = tag1 html tag2 = tag2 html tag2 = tag2html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you see now in the & PHP; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of docrc file intended for designing context sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation should be displayed for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated contextual elements to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / apps.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this is good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you won't be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the disk resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places there is an email-menu entry, such as DTD DTD-package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. to make a contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which it requires a GPG / PGP key. this guarantees the origin of resources, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploading from DTD DTD-package (DTEP) menus, uploading toolbars, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installing, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be cancelled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in XML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">Doctype Definitions line: the string that should appear in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, adds & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and to take full benefit from & quantaplus; to be able to draw, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to back up different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be all from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which allows common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the card holders with information and the tool bar. please check in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all tab, recharge, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editor area to add a context menu to the edited document content, such as edit / copy / paste, edit the tags in the mouse pointer, help to the word under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string under the mouse pointer is a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the tools of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is displayed as a standard for which a set of toolbars is displayed. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the symbol representing the tag. now, you can insert the data for this precisely inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate, open and roam information in the information to & quantaplus. in the representation with index tabs, for files, projects, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category hangs from the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of breakdown in global, local and project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script. by clicking with the right mouse button further functions are available, such as starting the script, editing or sending an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view you display the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can quickly change attributes and namespaces with it. the application-oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all error in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options to pass to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH in front of her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; therefore the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; following, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what has been developed by someone else? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only allowed users and developers to expand and quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details of the documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or help khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. see the section on templates. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when inserting from the clipboard there special characters for & HTML; -Note that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard to & URL; -Note which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">This allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of the scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Turning and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the column column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a single click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents will be grouped in the menu based on the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows, for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project managed. in Chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar, which only creates the name. actions must be saved by means of Settings... or you will be asked when you are asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; anyone who has made you or someone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTD are to be refreshed without updating the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, in the Tags menu, there is a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting using a tool bar denies when this day is contradicting the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed in the menu items listed above. click on them. click on an activated plugin to disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the current version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes may need time or create unnice graphics. it is recommended to use the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. by selecting an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; the main window is switched on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Sets the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and change the row sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in the context of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after filling the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift + F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have a static web content that you want to download and modify. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Be linked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be mounted. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the box, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree menu in the subwindow profile or changed using the Shift + F7 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, including files listed in .cvsignal are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the desired debugger. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information on Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles subwindow, upload profiles (see in) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by clicking its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was open.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Project icon Open Project from the Toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Various profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is hidden to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the kernel memory and forgotten by BAE. this option is useful when frequent upload of files is needed and the rather insecure password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; lots of upload profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your spruce, this is either a time-saving feature or a danger. use them according to your discretion. the password will be stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened, opened or deleted from the Project Toolbar Menu Project or Project Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; to your own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbar buttons are in & quantaplus; it is best to customize using the Toolbar menu. use and add differ. adding tool bar is handled in the bottom section of the Add tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set either using the context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar) in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can be removed, toolbar icons, or toolbars can be executed, which can be displayed in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up Toolbars in the menu with Settings... and set Settings... set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code cutlets and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are stored in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate manner to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find it all, from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or perl. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As a template Save As a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template Save as a local / project template Save as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged and dropped onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for example dragging and dropping or inserting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files you can click a folder on the right and select site template to enter a name for the template and backup. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can submit headers and footers or dynamically using & PHP; design, insert files or link them to them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set a folder's behavior in the template list with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set up, it would basically disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, one probably is in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows preordered or displayed text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying content templates to a folder with special headers / footers to furnish a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, using the context menu (pointing to the right mouse button), you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source text editor that can be accessed from the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and turn back to the source editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL editor. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL editor. to edit & PHP, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source text editor and the VPL; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and the VPL; editor is active, this mode is already active, the key pressure puts the active cursor from one window to the other, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization gap between the VPL editor and the source text editor can be set via the Quanta setting. after choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the web page so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called once a new document is created with the VPL editor. this is used to reduce the manual encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list makes it possible to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to integrate an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible like in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting using a button or distance button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way over the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the Tables Assistant or the Lists Assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for checking style sheets. unlike other stylesheet programs, searching for specific elements is possible and the style template design can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what changed exactly within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows enables resolving conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to synchronize and merge entire folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; for folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and leaning against the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other one differs in a line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease typing by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder folder folder 1 folder-1 folder-3 folder-3 folder-1 folder-2 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog shows your selection and displays it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately set up an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison then begins immediately. in the open dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar features. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you would need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now, you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; pull out. only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and dropping of text into another program as trimming and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is well to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences have been found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the abstracts column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. when the line breaks are enabled, the line is shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription Edition:, the filename and [changing] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains already text by automatically merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the jumps to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each difference must also be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. this group then becomes the current group. it is highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merge or manual work; no line is left in the queue; this is only a wildcard for the case that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may copy and copy elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignore options or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate primarily with the scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, up, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl key, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">You can also use the other buttons for editing in the display window. with the Paste button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">Clicking with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture up / Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict. note that all non-automatically solved conflicts continue to be considered as conflict. therefore, between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you must press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is checked, whatever you mark, will automatically copy to the clipboard and the manual copy is omitted. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newlines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix versions use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + newline files\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays fonts with variable width for selection, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic script will be displayed. if the chosen font does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered streamlined. on these systems, the preset button automatically adjusts an unregulated color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, each selection will be copied automatically to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which newline type you prefer for saving. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white signs are not ignored. also when merging, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, while others only store a newline '\'. if this option is checked, the cart return characters may be visible, but like a white character.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in the default setting. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively searching for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In auto-skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Resolves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merging menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merging for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be added to the suffix .orig. if already such backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to stop & kdiff3; quit and restart so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for the encoding a short note appears, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress any changes in white characters in text or view columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a colorfully coded keypad column. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files. by choosing A & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal yet another oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just hide the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison windows side by side or overlap. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. merge the current file together in the merge menu works even if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to reboot the merge, then the name of the last output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is given to this external command first. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own pre-processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for row synchronization to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 'refers to the found text in the first log. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line intercept. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Any character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead sed you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl some details are different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the regular preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... perform selected actions with either all (F7 keys), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the file dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, then folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merge. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files will be listed which were compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the folder scan is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions to open all subdirectories and open all sub-directories with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Double-clicking on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the colour is identical even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are regarded as identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option dirs are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and select New file instead of merge (unsafe) then check & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different but the same date appears, then an error message appears. if such errors are not fixed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When merging, a file is processed by the other. you indicate the status column when merging was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected happened. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is ok anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or odds), or all the entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then C will be used as a destination in the Three-Folder merge mode, and B will be selected as the target while synchronizing A and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all the entries in the destination folder should be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to only merge the current item: select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merge actions by conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options through, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select / continue directory merge again / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then execute & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on an error, a message and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) will not work together again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (set up Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. you can enter multiple patterns. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match that pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would be ignored by CVS too. many autologous generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be adjusted to a .cvindication file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a vertex attribute. in other file systems, a preceding point selects a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is switched off, symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the links like normal folders will be checked and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; do not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (specify an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security. please use caution.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this can be useful, for example, if the modification date has been lost. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are the same. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file will be suggested as an action. (this is considered insecure, because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view remains visible to the merge of single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can disable the option Directory & Text window and switch between the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and the text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do so, use the current file merging from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, however, if you re-read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contained. it is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished, whether a link to a file or folder shows. then, a file is always accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date deviate from the original. (please refer to the option of selecting the size.) (this is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts first always with the built-in difference viewer. to start KDE3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3 Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is applied as KPart, & kdiff3 assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then it takes & kdiff3; at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3 Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. bringing together or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heh it Kompare) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will first be treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines disappear next to each other, this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was too big so far. you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit a larger amount of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src lints; released and the text can't be deleted. what does this mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiffrsourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the subfolder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have any problems with compiling. if difficulties arise, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to re-read the folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the A, B and C labeling below the menu bar. if you click one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the workspaces, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both within a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows inside & Kpager; motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has the two entries to set up... and terminate. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and exit. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other areas of work.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in the & Kpager; the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is enabled together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is ticked, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is ticked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty areas are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">The window with its default symbol and Pixmap displays a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classic & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as from Pager applications appear in some other window managers; horizontal displays all virtual desktops in horizontal and vertical right in a vertical row, which is very well suited for representation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view and move the windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then set up selector switches... let the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not own a write permission for the file, you must login as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the package kdebase is, you need a working installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& kmag; is a screen lupe. you can use & kmag; enlarge a part of the screen, as if you read a magnifying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with a visual impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & kmag; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnifying window. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, the area around the mouse pointer is like a movable magnifying glass. alternatively, you can & kmag; to make a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the environment of the mouse-pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid displaying the mouse pointer in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer setting. please note that the mouse pointer is not yet able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the content of the magnification window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key or the & MMB; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), turn the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode a selection window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointer is resting on the same spot for a while. it is meant to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury Syndrome) and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer has remained in the same place for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive penin Injury (RSI) syndrome, and can emulate pain with the mouse. this requires little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain caused by the mouse click and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, the mere moving of the mouse may cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool should avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic auxiliary equipment, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulated. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging by pressed mouse button. the intelligent moving requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stowed after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When Intelligentes is switched on, the shooting range is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button, wait before it release the mouse button again, if no moving is done in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking by mouse shift. if this feature is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. this moves will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; to shorten the reaction time. to do so, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool will start; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog. if you have already clicked the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It is best to use & kmousetool, first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which places a click of a mouse is left without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link will not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse varies. it should be clear, however, if you view the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool, when a move is started. if you use the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you do yourself a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving may cause unwanted reactions. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the titels of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent moving, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool, and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely to copy text into the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool. instead, simply select a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is done every time & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. this allows you to know exactly when sliding the move time. later, you can use the smart move also without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window should be installed. this should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is short. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling process to start before releasing the mouse button. in this way, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order you use from the card order is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such read, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reavers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with pre-defined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for the re-formatting of messages from & conversation; or by e-mail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sends the text to & tts; for example, if you have set a female voice on the speaker card, you can read text by KDE messages about it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it passes the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters which were set up on the page below. the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of standard filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and will not be used. filters are processed in series to downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting string replacement filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text. case sensitive is not observed when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Replace column. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">These buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. if you load a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here. click the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID number-3432 indicates, you may only enter a copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all the conditions with an entry in the box Remove filter when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separations (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs add or edit as help for putting these expressions. the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package krontils.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc User Language program. if xsltproc is accessible through the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaking voice selection filter you can send texts to a particular speaker, which is set up on the card board speaker, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read from a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text sent to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that specify the text, which sends the text to & tts; and the features of the speaker set on the board of the card are selected.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is on your system the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you can specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected that best meets the required requirements. click on the button on the right to view the dialog box selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your subscriber settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The subscriber output filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Diesen Filters if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2679">To compile & execute, you need a recent development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including the packets kdelibs and the development files for the "speech-dispatcher" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for download or downloaded the Tarot created every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use a speech synthesizer, make sure that speech synthesizer works correctly with your speech synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of kttmsgr. the program kttmsgr will be developed in such a way that the creation of speech-dispatchers is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sentences. the user can go back to propositional or paragraph styles, repeat the output, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female, it is used, otherwise the best matching speaker is used. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; a spokesman selects, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add to add a speaker to the list, and in order to add a speaker to the list, or click Edit, the Vocabulary Book is displayed below. as an example, the setup of the Module for Festival Interactive is shown below. for details on the modules, please refer to.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path is included in the PATH festival, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the encoding for text handed over to the festival. in the case of voices, the & ktts; known, this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a number of controls and display them gray, the voice you choose doesn't allow you to set these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size. when you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first movement is synthesized faster (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed on the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start only the symbol named ktmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen reavers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. after the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message stops normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that speaks out messages. if you have a long text on a web page, you can talk to & mouth; nevertheless someone who is entering the room is welcome.</seg>
<seg id="2707">A text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, adds timts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and the output of screen reavers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; read Notify messages, start ttmgr and click alerts. the card alert appears.</seg>

<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the desired speaker. default selects the speaker, which is displayed as top entry in the list on the card board. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is set for a particular event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application. as a final option, the action will be carried out, which was specified under Standard (all other events).</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (british male), as this is the standard voice used in the edition of SSML.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs divide text into individual sentences. this allows & ktts; faster with pre-reading, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional detection filter. at the first start of a punctuation filter, a propositional detection filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add other set-limit detection filters, but beginners will be deprecated.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to set up the subscriber selection by trying out. switch on the subscriber selection and select text to read. switch on the list of subscriber boxes, change some features, and check how the subscriber's selection changes. of course, you have to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start faster with reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or stop text orders on the card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal propositional detection filter is set automatically when you start ttmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set-limit detection filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator character (Decimalcode 8) to the set limits (tab character are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default propositional sign filter preserves the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; -messages (knotify), warning messages, messages or the output of screen reavers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal punctuation filter from accidentally, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can override the subscriber settings for the application on the Speaker menu. the card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the speaker card speaker). in other words: no speaker features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which displays all the features of a speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & execute this speaker. otherwise, you select the speaker, which is most likely to match the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker features by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to have precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you may want to specify the language is present if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language other than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the standard speaker select and then use the speaker, which is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case there is 0 for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input is 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Ktmgr. crashes immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get backtracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer has crashed and & ktts; you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by this, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application. if I receive a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts with ALSA are occurring that prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have invited an extra voice for festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd. as a guide you can serve the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL where you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer moduls such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the card board for speaking device. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; pre-read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML bypass filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read web pages with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesperson, but & ktts; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce errors, the xsl file throws the GENDER tags for converting SSML to Saber. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate string reduction filter and now I can go in & out; no more spare-wise or go back. on top of the tab orders is shown, the order consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter to detect the punctuation limit.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling GStreamer in & ktts; the command line register. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedtelescoptop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts during audio output. if your system also counts, you cannot play music at the same time and read a text. and then, if you stop a text order and then launch another. you will find possible solutions for this problem on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not yet support real breaks. if you hold a text order in & tts; pause, the current sentence is read still.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The sox audio program is used for the general setting of the speech speed, but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can sox with the apt-get install sox command. the program is included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you downloaded tarball (with tar-packed archive), login as a normal user and unzip the tarball to a suitable folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2768">Before proceeding; check first if your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions that you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you can find help in the instructions supplied with the festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes festival 1.95 beta or new. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software to festival / lib / vocals / russian. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to set for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option has to be set to an 8-bit cyrillic, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; then Festival takes over the lexikalische analysis and & MBROLA; this produces the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no complete voice sharing system is. & MBROLA; generates language from diphon files. you need additional software to create this diphone. festival produces this from & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also produce from German lyrics Diphone.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & controlcenter; that allows the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & controlcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & controlcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & controlcenter; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module will display network settings in & controlcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured so that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows setting of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the & controlcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection will be offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and release status. by selecting non-revisions, the setting can be made permanently. then, when setting up the network settings, then this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, click on the button system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode, which is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. the following tasks can be carried out by the rider network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... can be edited in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are simultaneously started with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface during booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be enabled or switched off, depending on your needs. switch on an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be enabled or disabled according to need. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and click on interface to deactivate....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine asks http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and execution or downgrading in the list with the buttons Behind or Herunder in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking on the Add... button from the group calculator for name resolution can be added to a DNS server. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. then the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... the Edit dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name-known calculator lists hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used during booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list of particular known hosts contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this version of IP still exists in the test should replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog will display.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click Add. if the well-known calculator has multiple alias names, press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit... The Modified Computer dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">You can perform one of the following tasks, then click OK to update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system. to enable the changes, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a rpm console; with rpm as below:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool for your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice, but in addition, the development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended for experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found great prevalence. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future, and this description currently focuses on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in external networks, at & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the contact point that hasries a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore its arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own host). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, working as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if there is a different content found there in case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different status as expected may therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first was to create a tar surface for tar, which also provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it needs to be encoded by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; train the tape back and read the prestressing information of the tape. don't know & dat; the preponders on the tape do not, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the pretensioner, searches for the right index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the tape index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band has been integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; passes through a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape type must be formatted before you can use it to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive requires a tape to be formatted before use, this must happen before you are formatted by the tape of & kdat; floppy disk drives usually require formatting of tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and the capacity, the tape continues. all data on the tape is lost. after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog you can check again the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog box appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu item Verify....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure is started, the dialog will appear for checking. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the settings for the check, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before initiating the restore, the files to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog will appear for recovery. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the workstation for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the settings for the restore dialog, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the tape indexfile by means of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up which are located on the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be registered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling a tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up through the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & dat; before the tape is mounted, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; block the ejection in the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when loosening the integration of & kdat; automatically ejected the tape. do not use this option for floppy disks.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must communicate the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the tape has been formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information on problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information on problems that occur on their server. & kSystemlog; tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions at your disposal to easily filter and sort the log lines of a log file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting & ksystemlog; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if you don't see it, and it will open instead of a small message window, so you have & kSystemlog; very likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log, for the normal user normally no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or entered strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so that only the log lines will display the entry. in the default setting, the selection box contains the Show All. then a log line is displayed only when the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlog; all log lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is checked in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of the stage Note. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can switch to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new lines to be added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kSystemlog; enables the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage extra subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kSystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You will find more up-to-date information about the sources of & kSystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kSystemlog; also find in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of the program starts when the system starts up in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux kernel looks first in / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort, you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to launch when you boot the system or switch to another run level. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only launched once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d when you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning section you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably see that the default runtime is 3. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have a bit messed up then you can fix it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when a K contains, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. moreover, I could also have a user runtime, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other hand tool is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six Runners to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this only happens when they pull out an entry from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: items are moved when you drag them to a new range. to simply copy them to a new Runtime, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another run level, move it to clipboard (you can also use Ctrl + X) and insert it in the desired Runners with Insert (Ctrl + V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, it will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine is constantly changing. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the Enter key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; designed for running under Runtime X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please refer to the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply stop without message if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The significance of the & Linux; runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the Runtime so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapters Adaptation of & kuser; to start reading.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made any changes, you need to save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save button in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card is created, where you can make individual settings. further flashcards appear, if shadow passwords, or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management tab appears when shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if space constraint (quota) is enabled and initialized for at least one filesystem space constraint (see the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the limited space limitations are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tab card groups are informed about the group members of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's Properties dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot the default OS, add, remove, modify operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
