28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping m@@ all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had taken his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this heavy time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia believed that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things finally went up for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his way of connecting with his family was to always cook for us the dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the sign @-@ up of the S@@ F@@ PD under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or I get labels on the outside , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , with a television with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asks the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film runs with us from 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they drove home to the feed trou@@ ghs in a fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that ended the riding career again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses .
he had his family run over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ther for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen and with it also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala for the Golden Sports Pyr@@ amid .
there is no lack of awards to the lik@@ able ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen had already spotted him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it will not only be awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting the young generation for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time U.S. master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the distinguished members are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the fen@@ c@@ eman Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ dder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legend had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are not one in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the fact that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claimed Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will dras@@ tically go back to regulations , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like .
the democratic candidate has announced the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical party &apos;s wing of the Republi@@ cans .
thus , there could be party @-@ internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant .
Tr@@ ump is planning to build coal @-@ fired power plants and to drive coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment programme and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the transc@@ end@@ ental trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - they just want to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid better , for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump is trying to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ attle , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point out that the budget deficit would be even bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , which at least wants to demand from the rich , wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fle@@ dged wife has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone almost daily .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother is gaz@@ ing at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is watched .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Business Manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralised accommodations for single @-@ minded women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Foundation .
recently it was officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - either not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as a hope to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who thinks that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us .
also here single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ sed and under@@ estimated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about the experience , because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they would know about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some say no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or their own homes for single women and their children in some community shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Committee also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for men and women to be har@@ med separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks privacy or are housing men and women together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read by the urge to go to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new work combat measures
members of the Regi@@ stra@@ r have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire council to appro@@ ve more work fighting measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract .
resident doctors and medical students voted in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; persistent quiet , &quot; which led to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Committee has voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and claim official new negotiations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of escal@@ ating labour @-@ fighting measures starting at the beginning of September .
the conten@@ tions led to the fact that resident doctors struck six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA resident physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election for the rejection of the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which still took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed con@@ ta@@ gious , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable au@@ d@@ acity showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater since it was committed by an alleged friend .
to re@@ build the ve@@ al is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were responsible for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan is first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved of his ministry in the last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey also sh@@ ook him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian imports are again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formul@@ ates it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , as it regards its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment over the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara , claiming that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that are bre@@ aching from the West and feeling badly treated and now f@@ ading .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents were told at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ ped the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand is now only to be reduced to a back office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
at the BBC Scotland , Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told Scotland that the R@@ BS brand had been linked to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since then , when it almost collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised headquarters and the listing on the stock market are changed to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for private clients that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of the brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market at Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori blos@@ s@@ oms champagne after a double at New@@ market , winning 3,@@ 000@@ th of profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone at Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori ris@@ eth the jubil@@ ation when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ckey &apos;s have reached the milestone in the race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thri@@ lled fans for this sport for years .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would have gotten 6.000 winning if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already suffered a winner for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin damp@@ ens Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special En@@ vo@@ y for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it reads that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Committee . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been his deputy since 2012 , has been named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin website it is said ( in Russian ) that later he was the Chief of the Administration and Chief of Staff of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state in respect of legislative bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor .
are smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest friends and works as he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned on his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , there are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that right now .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once directed the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to tell me this very complicated job - you could almost say - entr@@ ust a difficult post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as Putin , a former member of the Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy .
when Putin reached the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was once assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as Putin &apos;s third term of office would have bre@@ ached the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president for three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Top@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for his dis@@ mis@@ sal on Thursday .
on the set there came to artistic dis@@ agreements and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how Gib@@ son &apos;s character from the series follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will not be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans that one can only wish for a series .
the scheduled transmission of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of the residents of Ban@@ ff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fishes around Sand@@ a@@ ale could be beaten by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ atoren Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slan@@ t cables .
the project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete deck for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first seal represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project is the closure of forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower of the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time .
mas@@ sively , because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3 % .
as the tolerances in which the team works were tiny - they were only a few milli@@ metres on each side .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after being thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck by 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble swimming while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turning around and presented us with the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ man boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the shore @-@ rescue boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot@@ engine had an emergency stop , but it dis@@ b@@ anded the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone today w@@ akes up over these men .
badly injured - man stri@@ ves for his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked and severely viol@@ ated his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic cul@@ pri@@ t cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he went twice to her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called on his mother .
this prompted his sister to wake up .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street , they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors should be taken a lot more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing concept for housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first of all it &apos;s about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group President Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas will in future have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can , however , also be built on the continu@@ ance .
the big controversy in the town hall is , however , the Brat@@ mann said : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still has to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem , so Brat@@ mann said : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er constraints for investors .
despite this , Brat@@ mann said , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is still not completely : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compensate for the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of getting flats back to the price .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the West@@ stadt , dead@@ lines run at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased , the aim of the so @-@ called mixing is to be removed .
there shouldn &apos;t be a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this concentrated on more building sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer walk outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Po@@ k@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course , I refer to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a series of animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand dropped at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the servers .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , can be photograph@@ ed ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when it was younger , joined the del@@ usion and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day .
cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , recently informed Washington Post that within two days of market launch , the number of follow@@ up people who train every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who exercise regularly reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as usual , there are also gr@@ ump@@ y qu@@ ir@@ ks that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it like ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the gymn@@ ast
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on full line brilliant .
and now finally an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ring on Thursday became a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ Camero@@ on A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es cont@@ ests on the floating @-@ beam during the individual multi @-@ campaign image of women in gymn@@ as@@ tics during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth while she holds her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world champi@@ onships , including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g each other after winning gold and silver in the women &apos;s multi @-@ campaign team at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the f@@ arewell ceremony of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on having never planned the future during their long distance , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became strength .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was easily led by two turns , the picture dec@@ ei@@ ves .
floating bars and ground yar@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - watched .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating bar - and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly when she expected her tail , a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ cked on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of team , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her clou@@ ding , she threw out kis@@ ses to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series mur@@ der@@ ous assault shot in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous assault by Phoenix while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told me that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder failed to have been the result of rob@@ ber@@ y , because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting the investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven persons were killed and two wounded within four months in nine ass@@ aults .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the firing squ@@ ad , aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ rons and secured a ball out of the seat as well as spher@@ ical fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his old friends , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about whom his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let myself in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course you left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her has been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycle ride .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; Please sing to me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a my@@ riad of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know it .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I did not expect that someone really can tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned with more rainf@@ alls all Saturday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their shores and threatened with extensive floods after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected municipalities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the congregation of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed additional 3 to 5 inches of rain falling in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday as it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record level over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the rivers that have occurred .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of the flood waters in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that he had warned him another step@@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ ats and flo@@ ats in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer was reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil had been considerably balanced by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floods cause the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching staff in five districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a two @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated to two churches , which were now both floo@@ ded .
the chairman of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that were washed by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up in order to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the high water and sand bags were provided for the residents who hope to be able to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses were reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday they were not reported yet .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wi@@ ped out of bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police told that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the waist , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital at his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was wi@@ ped out by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the sender that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car with 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot at , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to be a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , approached the scene .
it seems that this has been clearly an ongoing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were sleeves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , there seems to be several armed fighters who were involved very actively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year old girl was hit by a cri@@ cket at her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police is still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than a reason .
first , I &apos;ve been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ as@@ tics throughout the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to put it into the olymp@@ ic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . it &apos;s also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued as desired .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to allow inn@@ um@@ erable young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie to make a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ use exercise training .
I founded my turn @-@ foundation of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer young people high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic clu@@ b@@ team and thank you , you were motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors would like to organise more strikes after rej@@ y &apos;s H@@ et proposal rejected
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident doctors who voted in favour of a choice rejected it .
in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; No Man Land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first resident doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekly calendar items in order to improve care at irregular times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistant doctors announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance specialists still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and it will be given to treat all doctors . &quot;
in only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes through talks gri@@ pped the government on reluc@@ tance to participate and sometimes on a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the result of a promise Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had just done last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the penetration and address the worries of assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the resident doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work fighting measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , because nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the Strip .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ MA wants a better week@@ end@@ compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working combat measures achieve nothing of the only little but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the com@@ mon@@ ee of the assistance doctors and responded favor@@ ably with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries concerning the concerns of guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training sessions , additional training for those who return from vocational training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form bel@@ lies .
if the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the flow of blood and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British firm A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the line @-@ up of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes electoral fraud flour@@ ishing in Muslim regions
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year for the dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to widespread recognition that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , att@@ aches the police , election ob@@ servers and town@@ houses to ignore election mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now a king of corruption , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters made of religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off block tapes outside of elec@@ tive cab@@ ines to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead an ID to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report suggests not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they give up their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from un@@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only for electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special regional court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have put his critics to silence with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence for fraud throughout the country .
he especially vo@@ iced alarm about the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters , in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leading of ID cards to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the older , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ la@@ din background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists edit postal voting documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election harv@@ ests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report taken by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person must be carried out to ensure that they are entitled to vote .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists edit full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes from local elections .
the police have the authority to set up barriers to election stations .
a change of law that facilit@@ ated an indictment for intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the People &apos;s Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Cor@@ respon@@ dence Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photography in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out that voters go alone into the bal@@ lot box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral commission has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ up controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the City Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games come across the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , apart from the border and the band , who proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only ath@@ lete struggling with gold that has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the racing track , many people in the internet indicated how a certain arch guard of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio might be .
the crew member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused an attack on Twitter after pictures on which he looks suspi@@ ci@@ ously similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , except facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I feel it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ ski@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big , expressive eyes should be able to go through the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swimming pool Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption act@@ ress .
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who shows similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va exhibits more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator on the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese swimming float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds &apos;s analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle swi@@ mm@@ ers ou@@ tra@@ ged spectators of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian transmitter C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swimming mer@@ rier &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming stroke .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS &apos;s comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could say : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited he went like a low , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swimming float Ai Mar@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the flo@@ ats 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Mar@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard at which many people asked him
Twitter users did not get back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # indicated .
a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the commentary was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times at the end of the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ on via Twitter
comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about the Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on con@@ sign@@ ment and our followers in social media .
to clarify one , By@@ z@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy choice . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the mission and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ians , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am referring to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no cont@@ emp@@ t intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are ou@@ tra@@ ged by women who have sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to look , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered , as she looked at it , pulled it out and laid it back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone .
the primary business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before putting her back on the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the store said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of trousers out of the position , pulled out her own stock@@ ings and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she was simply there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the pants which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she laid her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , went out and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants that she had ta@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take shelter with him who had an other person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to withdraw the garments from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman touched her and went out and did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question have been withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from front or back , this video will show you how to turn the spe@@ ar for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you get closer to you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the gun line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with his knee to the bar and twist the weapon out of his hands while the attack@@ er is bent in front of pain . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the weapon and turn it , so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the Att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip , before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to deliver your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ gone his immune system and re@@ pul@@ sion of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k switched his course to a euro ticket , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before dropping any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment covered by the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of replacing the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a tensile toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public hand@@ rails to railway stations to washing sn@@ aps from toilets , the task put his immune system definitely under a test
in the film he said : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was able to live up to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse after their lumin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel movie &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s getting close to what I &apos;ve cleaned in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more mut@@ inous than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here in@@ doors .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to blame and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular associated with the well @-@ being of ga@@ stri@@ c and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ ci@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ oc@@ ative social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a del@@ oc@@ ul@@ ment with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had holes , wooden boards were opened , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be not as nice as part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted , street fighting with bas@@ eball bat , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be demoli@@ shed under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn
neighbors told them that they had to fight on the street and had to call the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing gave her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ oc@@ ations were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have been working with the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown side of the town@@ house garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant refused to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is always the final step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horri@@ ble for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ et@@ ching on the floor
workers of the house administration will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of the possession of a class B drug .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that it will navigate les@@ see who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told us that del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal in panic when a flying military jet flies over the beach
sun seek@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force provided an incredible dive
the air strikes admitted that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no safety risk
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ent jet crashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach of the sun @-@ seek@@ ers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzles without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew very deep two times and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low .
the Portuguese air strike forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility of the area , the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the poor visibility of the area , but the air strike forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which also four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air strike forces announced today that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible because of the conditions - strong fog and smoke - which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday the first step towards the first win in the new soccer season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash is rising three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ winner has to ren@@ ounce the Olympic football tournament with the sub@@ du@@ ed Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reig@@ ning Europa League champion , among others , on N@@ ey@@ mar .
in addition , there is also a lack of Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a col@@ dness in the training in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
so far , coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in the majority of the remaining competitions took preced@@ ence .
before the first mandatory match of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness level of the crew , who was humili@@ ated in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 on Saturday .
also at 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. really didn &apos;t really convince .
Sevilla , again , has the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid to di@@ gest and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in a separate league of table tennis players
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
thus the world @-@ ranked first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ dd@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
thus it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ist Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea was the last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympic @-@ podium .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the disk , between sentences and time @-@ outs , they didn &apos;t have coaches .
they had moved back to the grand@@ stand and left their shel@@ ters on their own in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve played the matches until now for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said in a logical way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really strug@@ gl@@ ed with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he determined the tempo at the top and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma it did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless enough stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ kun@@ ani won the game around Bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had suffered a ri@@ b injury , after that he had to settle down with tin .
inci@@ dentally , the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become a similarly high table tennis court Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now has short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment when the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt is false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media flock .
shaking Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by surv@@ ey@@ States from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see tr@@ ump at the front , but not with the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview by Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either succeed or I will make a very beautiful , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened to raise funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better poll@@ s .
instead , the Republi@@ cans &apos; candidate wants to get stronger under the arms of Congress .
Olympia : thre@@ ef@@ old fraud on dop@@ ing tests
the IO@@ C aims to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately informed a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials informed that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village , gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team leader Kenya of the Dop@@ ing Contro@@ ll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to make its own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the examination and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and issued himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , leaving the sample and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athletes , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan team of athle@@ tics , Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch , had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested at his return at Nairobi Airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences since a long time .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was usually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya received from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there is to be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar examination in Kenya , as he had requested in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been demonstrated that this sport has been systematically sub@@ du@@ ed and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
the athletes of Russia were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
the Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled herself with the role of Mary in a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright and bright . &quot;
so it &apos;s clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly top@@ ical : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ories went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful today as at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ sk@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death several weeks ago in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
sul@@ tan was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the east of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain as candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a winning victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the pres@@ idency candidate for the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman by Rei@@ d later said that he had not spoken to Clinton yet whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocking the territory &apos;s nom@@ ination were mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine is distingu@@ ish@@ able from classic school play@@ boys , as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that the calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to portra@@ yal of timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not adapt and lo@@ om Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ fel@@ ong Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of seek@@ ers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , there might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh attack of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds Church of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands of refugees from Turkey in the medium term , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already covered Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions ten months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing .
after the icy put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state , who takes in refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commander @-@ in @-@ chief compl@@ ained about the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in the al@@ mighty cities .
Erdo@@ gan now aims to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the Association demanded that the federal government positioned itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany too , a witch hunt takes place against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who are not adap@@ ting and lo@@ osing Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ isms , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported on appeal to figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised by political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people , and therefore nearly 29 percent of all candidates were eligible to receive asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey they do not find themselves in front of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum enti@@ t@@ lements according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
the regional elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
because so far it &apos;s not going : summer holidays , heat and country elections - it &apos;s bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the elec@@ tors , are on vacation .
most holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the locals , so do not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during holidays , hel@@ pers who hang on posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count votes at the end are only lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and last holiday of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let itself be passed over to the people by means of an election campaign .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what is left at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the land , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and talks a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , counsel@@ or Merkel has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him a beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaign at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice been invited by Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ enburger and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other parts of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election conditions on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means co@@ ca@@ ine , play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that on the ground , you crum@@ ble the base , that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any in the widths of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U vot@@ er champion Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village protests , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were last at 22 percent behind CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election in 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of holiday ad@@ versity and largely res@@ ell their election campaign to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green campaig@@ ners go on search for traces of local voters under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just circul@@ ates with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week as planned , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the meeting of those responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of tourist arri@@ vals .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg exists , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the journey through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King , responsible for the restructuring of the restructuring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bak@@ ers@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ lands had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some truck stops in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not met , the church also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ stepping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself know@@ led@@ geable about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been las@@ hed .
the quick@@ est was on the way at 77 km / h in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the street is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to be seen in the maps .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to break@@ through@@ s in them allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some are less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the refur@@ bish@@ ment has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running science is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locals are the most exploited ones along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
this is exist@@ ential threat .
not only it , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is reduced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road map has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dump@@ ed its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has answered a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where such a bit gener@@ ously handled .
for all law@@ suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently visited because of the complicated traffic guidance .
if you cannot approach it , it is also very different elsewhere .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his pedi@@ gree cuts back to the end of the rehabilitation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner re@@ members the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
it is permanently bol@@ ted to laws in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a d@@ ul@@ ment status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the conci@@ li@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
other , more advanced points would first be discussed within the parties .
also from this I be@@ hol@@ den myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as the Minister of the Interior , he was in charge of results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had given a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announces that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to place sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U husband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents a few new ideas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have in part in themselves : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he plans quick@@ ening procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deport@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees that are targeted at the country should check their smartphones beforehand , and make social media accounts open for security checks .
in case of D@@ ul@@ ties for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to face some even worse than previously - such as commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally cur@@ ri@@ le .
some of them also have an unpleasant effect and are open to questions .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does it mean to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that people were deeply involved were not to be wa@@ sted even in election campaigns .
inner security is enormously concentrated in the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security .
in the last days the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ bled stri@@ fe over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the leaders of the resort also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
there is nothing of a departure from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not sensible to re@@ vo@@ ke you .
and in case of a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot of things in it , which could cause controversy .
but the SPD is also trying to distinguish itself from the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel once cau@@ ti@@ ously signals the willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still gli@@ st@@ ful .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , ex@@ tradition numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the recall action , there are vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year with the deliveries .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest automobile manufacturer will continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July the core brand VW declined notably in Western Europe and again loaded the total sales as the company announced in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.@@ 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost one sixth .
sales leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July , above all on two sales days , less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , it has given a reluc@@ tance to buy in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for ex@@ iting from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ gas phase first escal@@ ated , a minus is also to be found .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected brand of Lower Saxony is still frau@@ ght with the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , there is only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales Chief Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales report from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software retri@@ eval .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting in the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer issued a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was said on Friday in corporate journeys . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen will now grant its German customers a guarantee of upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion no deterior@@ ations take place and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen is seeing the possibility that for example , for example , customers might come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid that in any other damage , which has nothing to do with the ass@@ aul@@ ting sc@@ andal , it is necessary to ins@@ ure on possible warranty regulations as it was said .
that is why VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pun@@ ish@@ ments from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank Director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see in it a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordinary savers would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay punishment for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay its 0.4 percent penalty .
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund asks for this fee from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will cost 400 euros per year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he has kept 40 million Euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and costs 0.4 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , he now passes the costs further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be too dangerous to make the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank counter@@ s : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four rob@@ ber@@ ies , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the board administrator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you alone carry it unless it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically feasible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with criminal interest rates for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , CEO of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay fees for deposits on a nationwide basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is endow@@ ed with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she is h@@ ating money free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the President of the Federation of German National B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it is threatening the migration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not be pleased in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually purchases sound plates ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
before comm@@ itting to the comment section to review it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ vi@@ um Men &apos;s Inter@@ medi@@ ate with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a plate are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older ellers tend to retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ go@@ v vote ?
if this blog is a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and stu@@ ffy before I stop , hold my hands and say something stupid as : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I received from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of persons : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a vast number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought I was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to You@@ go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records .
from the conversations I &apos;ve conducted , people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to followers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that disk stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an imp@@ etus at the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that evo@@ ke bli@@ ss@@ ful remin@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a collector for me and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ rts from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month did not yet listen to it .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase a record don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I smo@@ ther through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP so that I can put them on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts is the latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such a diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but the psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather casts a window bum@@ per than a big shopping .
it does not deserve a lot , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I seem to have the impression of dar@@ ing the pants for je@@ ans , I watch a group of young girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of sheets of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with the st@@ rolling through plat@@ ings of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they ste@@ er clear of the star@@ ving look of an unc@@ anny , thirty @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who stands above the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of businesses in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary businesses where people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , offer bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which are a risk of fire and health .
humanitarian groups shared the court that stores and restaurants are important as free meals offered by the state @-@ supported associations and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run 72 provisional business , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the t@@ ear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café des Birkenau , which is generally operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it meant that the closure would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle has increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ ur@@ er : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are being tested which are intended to transfer Tem@@ po@@ iz@@ ers particularly effectively .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident @-@ centers where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ ur for the observ@@ ance of speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in continuous measuring operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans by time , road and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ powered condition one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
to ensure that it is not simply cl@@ ung , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and , by the way , also disappear into a safe outer h@@ ull .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flas@@ hed with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 copies last year .
great Britain ob@@ tains silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the finale on Thursday evening in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ e Stadium .
Fi@@ ji delivered a master class in handling , side @-@ ping , back , line run and raw power to gain gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour .
the defeat was beaten by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but in this form , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in top form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation to GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ry@@ an , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , they lost Ry@@ an every match at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the attacks stop G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run into running bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au passed over in the corner .
with still four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a rival T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but Fi@@ ji has only stopped .
in the seventh minute ath@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new member since the re @-@ start and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided over more weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant mid@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ tan whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame took the cake dot with another try in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ef rang out , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked off in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown gave the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ ined gold as in these games , and that will mean something .
from the first ru@@ dder stroke to the last 220 hard h@@ ers that enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the two who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was alone when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic gymn@@ as@@ tics in a row without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ fired use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ ens gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of trium@@ ph@@ al go@@ ose .
behind every gold in the herd , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that can be operated and that did it .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term at all in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough .
that &apos;s how it begins .
rowing on itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ wra@@ cking morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you goes to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver must appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , is reti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the big water producers .
so it was time ago in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Broad@@ casting .
a little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken appreciated the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was a member of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emplo@@ ye@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years , is 28 years as managing director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ uth , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed General Manager of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to weekend parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , it called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new F@@ oun@@ tain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new F@@ oun@@ tain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ purchase of the high tank ( 1999 ) , the new purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still and there was always new additions , because water is the most important food for people and drinking water .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken &apos;s water forum .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well as well as the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rup@@ ture at the elevated tank at Kirch@@ uth on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n , because you filled up the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .

soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now he is now studying in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Schrot@@ t .

relationship of Relation@@ ship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - A man shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and killed them mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after him I was publicly convic@@ ted .
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bal@@ dness .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon , so the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not initially want to make any statements about the death or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from the promotion of green electricity are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains at the release of the renewable energy system for existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is a certificate with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel mills will be replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent will fall .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when it comes to re@@ forming emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of China threw up massive steel on the world market in light of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers reject price dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a bit .
on the one hand , suspended import duties on import steel have effect , on the other hand , the economic outlook in China has risen .
how sustainable the price collection is unclear is unclear .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
at the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million metric tons , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she taught music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing me emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total more vivid , she says .
by the way , she does something good to her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior League .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
due to the regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to leave and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the pu@@ ste in everyday life as well .
also when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz of the Federal Collabor@@ ation of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people w@@ akes up many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
by song lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia are dec@@ lining themselves for long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special power is also required for the head , explains L@@ enz .
to focus simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , you can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found via the internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , you can ask your family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research .
if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ bly to scre@@ ams of young cats
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover what effect the litter of cat babies has on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not let the males cold - however , they always remained the same in the difference to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great need , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams is different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned to the loudspeaker more quickly , when the cry of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens was playing .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or evol@@ ves with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises in humans .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist told Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even at the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
it doesn &apos;t stop even before football .
against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant .
accordingly , the southern bank living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ku@@ r is said to be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency , initially imposed for 90 days , is still valid until October , but in fact , this has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places across the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
but what the Turkish population den@@ ies in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict refusal of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne season proved its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has finished the season in an outstanding fashion and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record player found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ kno@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; say good @-@ bye also in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 season hits as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ scor@@ er king , laid the foundation for the 14th Tit@@ le .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez who stood under the contract signed by the AC Florence after the attempted coup attempt failed to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the stri@@ ker would have to be prepared to ren@@ ounce about one @-@ third of the annual salary of € 7.5 million , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have still med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other obes@@ e sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing determines the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who after a dop@@ ing lock had su@@ ed her start right shortly before the games , was pi@@ ped off mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
it was a bizarre scene : with a smile she was still st@@ rolling in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when she realized she wasn &apos;t going to get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering storm .
but there are still many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ squ@@ ad@@ ron / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after having detected the dosage of the pain medication Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the sent@@ in@@ els and was locked six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ squ@@ ad@@ ron / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time World Champion above 400 m , had been positively tested and locked for 21 months in 2010 .
a means for penis enlargement have been responsible , devoted Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete was subsequently recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing with it .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to give Olympic silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championships because of testosterone ab@@ uses .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also given back by a ruling of the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year old world champion , clu@@ es were found on the capture of a forbidden health supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran already on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her journey home for the beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , be still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in located some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives then went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
when det@@ on@@ ating near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives have gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory police station .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast , demanded several wounded .
one goes out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brig@@ adi@@ er Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ am@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days the authorities would have received secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is st@@ aking behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in lies a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions given by the Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between the security forces and the Muslim population , not necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were conducted a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence also in the years to come .
j@@ un@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to fom@@ ent chaos , while the country turned towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , will benefit himself to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the insur@@ gency of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
over 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ S@@ hr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Compl@@ aint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several state offices , the constitutional guards in the federal government have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we look at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German press agency Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß , Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are disper@@ sed in an extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ultural &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional guards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ aß said that his authority was closely aligned with the State Off@@ ices when deciding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians had been reported from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ aß said he had no findings .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the clear increase of rights @-@ induced crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ aß said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years , we have established that there can be judicial structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ eman Group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing groups or small groups form the plan to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee shel@@ ters or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the existing groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who previously did not appear in the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wor@@ rying thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum accommodation were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left who , however , have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist propaganda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always do the Olympics or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ loaded swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite afterwards .
in fact , the 24 year old finished his race with a resi@@ due of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty character , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more familiar .
since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ names made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ b of the W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he first struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre @-@ free style , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney caused the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming trainer from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a race over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so narrow
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks to a campaign event in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump is losing the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a phone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , more and more resistance was last formed .
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously big .
the Post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the company will shortly want to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post will also want to offer its electric vehicles on the free car market as of the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they should be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are shipped to other farms .
post management Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , such as by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bonn Group will shortly enter the mass production of the vehicles .
in its post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ ald announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ K leadership res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the set@@ backs arrived suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the global number five of the industry faces a new start .
G@@ RP CEO plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
already on the 1st of September , the leadership in the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ erk@@ inger , who shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the set@@ backs , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention details .
in the future , anyone who will be the leader of the market research company is still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ bahn it was said on Friday that the shareholders had a great deal of dis@@ appointment regarding the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced several years ago .
Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K for 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will some@@ time become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this was the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company failed to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year .
in the first half of the year , sales contracted by 3.4 percent to 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros .
the profit in the second quarter has mainly imp@@ acted the company &apos;s s@@ unken value in view of its difficult economic situation .
the impair@@ ment of EUR 139 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus flo@@ ats in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
during an accident of a touring coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Aur@@ ich County ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , infected the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus from a travelling company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her data , had to avoid a truck stop , some of which drove on the opposite direction .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a tren@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency medical car came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back from a regular bus to Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner &apos;s P@@ ew@@ sum district .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the trucks and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Board 3,@@ 44 instead of previously 2,@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the waste water charge will increase once more if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that under the approval of the budget , the administrative office Kul@@ mb@@ ach established that under@@ cover works for these sewage systems .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems for a cost @-@ covering manner .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the body , a new calculation of the charges for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will be equ@@ ated .
the serious ag@@ it@@ ator increases founded Schmidt on all three sewage systems for relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , lying between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , in the past period of calculation , all three installations are not least incurred due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant due to damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyors had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed after almost 20 years of operation , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to comply with the requirements of water law in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to these extraordinary expenses , the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of small sewage treatment in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; were completely defeated . &quot;
in the process , Schmidt completed the market community of great entertainment costs in the se@@ wer systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious after the view of stone houses , especially since it is impossible to extend the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal waste water @-@ purpose association in order not to extend these facilities because it is defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % has been recorded .
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10.5 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a rise in prices of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained unchanged in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its fil@@ ter@@ tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already bor@@ dering on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ da@@ unted , self @-@ winding tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ cre@@ tions reach the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have raised cri@@ tiques in the past where they were accused of promoting black@@ face conveyor or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them s@@ lit eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es showed a greater problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced it would have disabled this feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet were widely spread across the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vulnerable and gentle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was drag@@ ged into the wan@@ ing extrem@@ ity .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling block .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than before , &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that rac@@ ist @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu cri@@ tically critici@@ zed the large part white , just male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on its workforce diversity and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel responsible , focusing on sub @-@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , on their part , said they closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fy IS@@ IS intelligence intelligence , set up Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were permitted on @-@ site , an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Committ@@ ees , Intelligence Committ@@ ees and the Military Com@@ mit@@ es , reports on great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information presented by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders typically marked a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed actual conditions locally and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened to Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , stated .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com are up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indication that government spi@@ kes under Obama gave instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com family publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to life after they were added that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights into the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest ranking democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , said Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats agreed not to have found any evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported cases of investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , which was received by Cent@@ com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations also have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alleg@@ ation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the alleg@@ ations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush looked forward to a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team points out that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of its exc@@ essively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in the Central Command .
the US won a fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their gates in mind .
however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last play of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will leave the strong Dutch for a little longer , leading the other group .
as always the game may start on Saturday , Americans have spark@@ ed a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story four years after they landed at the last of the last London games in the last 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey stick in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Director of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder completely around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a back@@ gauge from the near area .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
it performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball in the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. door keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympics .
Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel ste@@ ad@@ fast and unavoid@@ able , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coff@@ es@@ hop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who , for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic Tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was perceived as spar@@ sely the last 16 years that many who had questioned , did not know that it is an Olympic port@@ as at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
the trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympics .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending pop @-@ up - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winner jumping on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ ul@@ ling and salt ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are judged according to the execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ and @-@ one athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must move on in their pursuit of gold , faster , upward and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the original wall , but also another highlight in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympic dream .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel as ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly upwards again .
there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no cur@@ v@@ ature in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualifying and final hours will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 1.@@ 00 pm .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end rounds as part of a afternoon block from 14.@@ 00 on both days .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by ang@@ ling and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently suggested - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his new fan community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia came across the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen were shot and killed in tens of thousands of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist risks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , where dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or to prison , either killed or driven into the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ asi@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been en@@ forced more or less in recent years , would benefit from the tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of h@@ ink@@ ering in the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was not until the last few years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the Internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians given that they gathered to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as prosp@@ ered , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high @-@ lands , in politics and economy , while explo@@ iting the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos feel that Ethiopia is largely dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian prime minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively non@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ esting , which , according to information by analysts , were seemingly self @-@ cat@@ ered by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train and meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation .
but evi@@ dently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ ic city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray are becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ y@@ flights across the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump states Obama &apos;s claim that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gible to the American public .
it also brings its fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of decl@@ aring statements which he could not have meant at all .
after he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Tr@@ ump retired in regards to the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement , he reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism lev@@ elled Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling poll@@ s .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue .
talking about Twitter , he warned Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he later explained &quot; Of course , I said that sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ bor@@ ative tone , because his survey values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he is increasingly focusing on the attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to face him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true , in this sense , that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called it back@@ bit@@ ers , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Clinton served as Minister for Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by making it aggressive under control in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ta@@ sted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s excuse as just another proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once driven by market price , Café arrives in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , which sold Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people rob@@ bed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but when New York is changing , it &apos;s also new finding .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time associate of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide cash for a new outside office , he was excited to do so , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els purchased the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ris@@ ings such as cap@@ ers and fried onions .
there are nat@@ ure@@ tic dishes .
the café does not serve beer any more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point she would take the path .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the verb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gave up the coffee t@@ ine for a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even though they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of their usual coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarter to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap to make Ver@@ b a coffee of coffee in coffee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has pre@@ tended to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café was closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coff@@ ees felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for the refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on that day was somewhat more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bur@@ ck@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small local snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture did eat .
when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ ery , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ in @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served fresh baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the ways with which the country was going to be no longer a land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e told why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man noted that coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was at the heart of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
peculiar hybri@@ ds have been tried , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ses over taste or even wholes@@ ome cooking skills .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
as never before , or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - exagger@@ ated the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge to transform the pamp@@ as such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant @-@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was a real stranger to reality .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt would perhaps have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the announc@@ ing of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with eating , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was afraid of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind bag incident .
after the plates were removed at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s place , they and Co@@ e drew up a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um desserts that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to give a modest name to a modest recipe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pr@@ un@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each dig@@ ged somewhat reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a sur@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set up his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers compose their own life in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian worker , showing him at an 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol of symboli@@ sm in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing difficulties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the picture of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to strike terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ y usually only come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s hair has only 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms down at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lon@@ el@@ iness , however , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed long that Greenland &apos;s hair will be st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland ha@@ y is hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the li@@ fest@@ y@@ les &apos; li@@ fest@@ y@@ les .
they measured their slow motion , when they made six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks nevertheless make this shar@@ k : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and seek cad@@ a@@ vers looking down from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ arks , which Fischer took between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ sts of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons try to das@@ h large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the second smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res , the l@@ enti@@ l centre , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons attempts , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in contrast , all the larger Greenland h@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign length to an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at the age of 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ y with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is not a coinci@@ dence that such methane em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland qu@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often also runs on as@@ par@@ agus fl@@ ames .
they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse therefore is much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the cur@@ rant of evolution bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .
building site in a double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focused on issues surrounding construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the board accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the real estate , plot and settlement questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for surve@@ ying were clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ et@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße area - phase 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way .
the municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and the elderly .
as it was said , Bau@@ willing participants can immediately report to the town hall . the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September meeting .
in order to also be able to comply with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n area , the commercial area has already been extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
so the city of the Main has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether or not to continue investing in London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , authorisation has been submitted to them in the UK so far .
they are using large US banks .
several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lobby association anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other major authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk category ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg conce@@ als a big fund industry , as well as Dublin does worse with infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city is equipped with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the River Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of business consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ists .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead gets legal expenses from the hepatitis C patent case with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc would be entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal expenses arising from H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated by a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ur@@ des and other in@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit filed on Thursday , US Secretary of Justice Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction in costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate Gilead to the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck co @-@ accused each other and claim ownership on laboratory work to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir Dev@@ el@@ ag , the active ingredient in the Gilead &apos;s medicines .

the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) stem from the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are doing just clearing work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn € 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal tax
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which revealed an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the pres@@ idency candidate , and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in free speech . former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million to the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for the Vice Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and withdraw@@ als with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the democr@@ ats of the democr@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already declared that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business rules and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday , promp@@ ting high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she also spoke about the topic during a speech to the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also endor@@ ses the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tr@@ ump to meet their tax declar@@ ations .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump was afraid of the elec@@ torate and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 Clinton &apos;s tax return showed that these only USD 100 of their income referred to as wage , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons tax@@ ed and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
wildlife conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chil@@ i powder .
the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , intensified its promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the World &apos;s Day devoted to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include lighting of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chi@@ le cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom breaks down with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust in the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to hunt the elephant .
one last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er who sho@@ ots a fire@@ work fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
town coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ osk @-@ building on the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of tra@@ des@@ people with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - especially the retail trade in the core city - is considered to be significantly out@@ dated .
however , the City Council unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales floor near the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony currently under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we generally welcome new businesses , but at this site in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prompt - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots has un@@ le@@ ashed a media tur@@ mo@@ il after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre@@ fix , as Arab guests would have requested an employee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caused his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country code list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and destroyed ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cks him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee stated that the measure is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pres@@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
that is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazilian city , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be converted to save money .
some of the protest participants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti on the provisional president Michel Tem@@ p spra@@ ying on walls .
the latest protests erup@@ ted a few days after prot@@ esters hit the streets in crowds to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest on the part of Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , the ambassador concluded .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trading margin between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian representation abroad issued around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , mainly travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran achieved top 20 countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador is hoping to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking for witnesses : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ raid has been practiced on Thursday evening on the drinks market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
three dark @-@ dressed individuals , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the release of cash from the employee of the drink market and subsequently fled by foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
the police did not share how much money was carried out .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is very well observ@@ able .
after the raid , the perpetr@@ ators have to follow the road to Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have escaped from the gravel @-@ car park with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
if you have made observations at the time of the tat@@ too ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , you should contact the police urgently .

the joy@@ ous group was accommod@@ ated during the first week of school during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ rette with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip took us to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
at the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group was delighted at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
children and car@@ egi@@ vers were treated with their own meat dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .

on the day of the voyage home laugh@@ ed the sun and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the min@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ s@@ pilgrimage of all the altar @-@ stran@@ ts in the next two years , the Church of Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
different pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were tested and eventually chosen for the Bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg Min@@ ster .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms , went on the way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ z sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and distributed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved wife and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was assigned .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made rest to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m song .
par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available for the nights .
on the stage of the stage Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller added for a tasty and star@@ chy dinner and breakfast .
we continued the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day was the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , but at first the high heat had to climb around 500 al@@ timet@@ ers and then climbed again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a common barbecue at the bathing sof@@ ten@@ er in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse , God thank@@ ed God .
at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metrop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner pl@@ ung@@ es home when Br@@ ite won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner was the last evening in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had done to his own . the J@@ uss@@ el made the legend hau@@ ghty when he stor@@ med his home to win a victory from New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of the six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they scored a modest sixth place in London at the World Championships in London in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos; res@@ ignation .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Green .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic cord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
lap fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there was a hin@@ dran@@ ce that after a weak start he dropped intentionally to the rail@@ road .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a superb victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have come so badly with so many titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ ys it &apos;s possible to repeat Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they came to the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition in which W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday , he fought with representatives before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to himself to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ ong , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB Team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a band of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton took place in April in the middle of sex and bul@@ lying pen@@ alties , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
the future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melt from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the supply contract and thus will unlock all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to give further subsidies to the plant operation .
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation in Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry melt which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p keep smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L believes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; said the company .
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; that would have come into force as of November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on earnings to AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual subscription to the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in anticip@@ ation of termination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not affect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation for why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 MW of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an Reality TV star , which is on the cover of the September edition of the Vog@@ ue
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Cant@@ ara is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vog@@ ue .
San Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Antonio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , a split reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ d act of almost every birthday of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on girl on a play@@ site at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity .
with a view to the September edition of Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kar@@ d@@ hi@@ an began with certainty .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim may have beaten her , as regards the Vog@@ ue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine &apos;s September edition is a league for herself .
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles a picture band rather than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the em@@ itter 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years images of the Bulletin still se@@ ep before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover are Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mo@@ urn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the low chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she finds herself in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers doesn &apos;t like success for everyone .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called her the mist@@ let@@ oe of the moment .
these feelings che@@ ered up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but riding around on the mis@@ si@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she is running for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is watching Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal law centers annually assign 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies are reported annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is looking forward to the impact of further central cuts on already over@@ bur@@ dened transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ zations and similar - have been rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of the Municip@@ alities Centre of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Public Research Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been dismissed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who are leaving violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been divor@@ ced by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of vulnerable people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Ministry of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of employee re@@ port@@ edly weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after it has been told that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on a staff while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i had been waiting for months to have waited for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he compl@@ ained to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i found that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not need to be fired to harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - gun owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival should be elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip due to bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Press spokes@@ woman Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to reach an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this yiel@@ ded representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could scar@@ c@@ ely rule in the north , this is not possible after the poll@@ s in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to stand up to the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite moderate losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated with 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) in Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
the N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the parliament with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the poll@@ s in Berlin , the SPD ( election of 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) , according to the poll@@ s , came to a mere 23 percent .
the CD@@ U was only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still lag@@ ging behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors are domin@@ ating the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ o and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was also not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory initially consisted of eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came just 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but they are somehow origin@@ ating from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as the &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit tor@@ ment@@ ing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then they found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smart phone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates providers who came all a lot later than Nokia .
being online everywhere and everywhere today is for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , while Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , an entire industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only in early 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , easy to operate via touch screen .
the Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had the after@@ taste .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen is now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks back 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens board of staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row won &apos;t only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London , but also throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we took a big effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we already have 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ unders were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse play &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that his desktop side would change the coding on his advertisements in order to make it difficult to recognize the recognition of which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that there was a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the line @-@ up open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of indicators lock@@ ers , &quot; and that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how high concern indicators have become for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook adver@@ ts .
the company has opted for ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers do not have an effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man shared .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large share of revenue , so Facebook seems worthwhile to invest in such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ encing tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have instead concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to get more control over people &apos;s hands .
woman suspected of comm@@ itting suicide on Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday after a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred shortly after midnight on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d .
a woman lay in the dark in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been questioned , but some have not yet been identified , the police told these and every witness of the incident to report to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , told G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was said in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted after she had taken over a man and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took up the court .
the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who responded to an emergency call -- went to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Kli@@ m@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once hab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms resem@@ bling those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have identified similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless turned slowly .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun , which was 30 percent matter of matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its daylight side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously assumed by planetary researchers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burned out of ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus clip in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy withdraw@@ s as a coach of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I have thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , which it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League .
he led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the night season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
le@@ ee@@ pers resume talks again , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes concerning compensation for the North Sea workers will be exposed , while all conten@@ ders will sit on the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the present dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day meetings over the next few weeks starting next year to restart the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , the Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has strengthened itself by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in the star cluster to different rates , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the development of the planet .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star@@ ches , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now fastest .
to top rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars exp@@ el large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star al@@ erts , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest generation of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby larger stars revol@@ ve more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot in front of us about what we like to know more about how , when and why stars are slow@@ ing down their rotation rates , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emo@@ tive release , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was chosen to be the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature , under a ten @-@ year contract , has been awarded 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was paying for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for his teams ( 1994 @-@ 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the rest hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave rise to forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was arrested for 211 games by the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to have been a major suspect for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played through for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his f@@ arewell @-@ days did not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends win the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and following the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , was inspired by the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ s@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio will not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 is over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a learned ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimming float Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already cri@@ tically poll@@ uted athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final about 100 m of butterfly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have taken part in the runs over 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested an opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for sanc@@ tioning the athletes with positive cases .
also at the night of Rio the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova oo@@ ked , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went herself to the offensive himself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said that the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O is involved in the banned substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe should also have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately announced his criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both of them deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association banned the entire Russian team from the start , except for systematic dop@@ ing , and also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the former tre@@ ading in China caused violent clas@@ hes between athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had a positive effect on the tri@@ meth@@ azi@@ de stimul@@ ant in the Chinese nation@@ als , but only had to sit in a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : h@@ acker succ@@ um@@ bs her ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 firms in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to pay the money required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes in terms of attacks on company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som will be considerably higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programmes were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred in the past months frigh@@ tening fast .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates according to a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it sel@@ ectively searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users use the personal photo database at stake , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware beat .
22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will receive their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain to their victims via chat how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t free sample files .
and if private individuals are redeemed for payments of only a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the Anti @-@ Virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included in delivery is a custom@@ ization tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then seek further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commis@@ sions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per authenti@@ cated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not sufficient threat to successful capture , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing programs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential damage potential is much higher , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ ers Conference of Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0 .

the materials of the interior are well finished and pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top falls down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles while storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l at high and 10@@ 26 l at inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is up to a height of 1.@@ 24 m from the floor .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do his work a little qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is still another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision alarm sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the remote lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller re@@ acts to the recognition of traffic signs and throt@@ tles the speed if required .
but full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is conceivable only for risks that are typical for air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee cap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
after their journey , ill vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family was seriously ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il holiday .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective sewage plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip had been flaw@@ ed with it - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was defective .
but the promot@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus the judgment .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion with each other - belongs to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , according to the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , said that many people would have worried about further attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be so@@ ber and decisi@@ vely re@@ acting to terrorist risks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hate and division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t allow this triumph to terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if convic@@ ts would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength of the population are also the consent of the population for refugee policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium of four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is aimed at improving the right of weapons to be amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet becomes more difficult .
the last much discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians is to be maintained in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a view on psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps increase security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior minister spoke clearly against shareholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear@@ thing for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a general prohibition of fully conce@@ aling it un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you refuse and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules , for example in road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter designed the minister to simulate vig@@ or and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people no more safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the free@@ way feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the right @-@ wing bend is to be extended .
this is good news for all the motor@@ cyclists who are driving on the surrounding road every night in traffic jams , when driving over the motorway towards Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the state @-@ owned road construction extends in the area between Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ er Straße the right @-@ bending track by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is spread early , whereby the overall flow is improved on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district representing Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the train station bo@@ thers the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the return trip extends up to the bridge over the Alber@@ gh@@ an route and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here traffic is only defl@@ ated one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back over a quarter of a year ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to double @-@ gauge the heavy load traffic .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ day traffic jam will last , the competent state company cannot say .
however , with years to expect : because the bridge has an official remaining duration until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the right @-@ wing bend , the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities .
traffic is passed on to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Offers for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater now plan a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from eleven to fifteen years visited the st@@ aging in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome cards the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
between September 2015 and March 2016 most young people in the class came from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical communication are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany a line through the bill in the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the spectacle of heaven , said the chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ s , which are one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is far from the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders and there can be many causes for them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Di@@ flu@@ ence and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but what one understands for the time being is the in@@ som@@ nia , thus an in@@ transi@@ ence and sleeping disorder .
just staying asleep many people feel un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board of the German GP association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
it is not unusual that sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is frequent above all in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors cause each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , he advis@@ es .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any resident sleeping doctor in Germany , stresses Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
therefore , when sleeping problems first contact the family doctor , she advis@@ es .
he can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , snor@@ ing with breathing exhau@@ sts , in case of abnormal heart@@ iness , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers or when one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not take a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ inging , one goes to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping end .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wear counts on : regular sleep and stopping times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , avoid watching television to sleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook to dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 he first picked up gold at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20.000 € bonus and a jungle king 15@@ 0,000 € no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page last night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in the swimming arena is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to announce nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .

airport : the ban@@ de of luggage racks arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , civil investig@@ ators from Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage racks as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to the police officers from past th@@ ef@@ ts .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July this year and had worked in a common , labour @-@ friendly manner and especially professionally .
the experts of the crime comm@@ iss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves , who had entered Germany in order to commit crimes to Germany .
in total , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a couple of lime trees , still a remnant of cob@@ ble@@ stones in between : the R@@ ī@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem like that at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already being built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have le@@ ased contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin @-@ based sen@@ ator handle had advoc@@ ated a harsh treatment of the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after the police cleared the premises on the ground floor , the cad@@ a@@ for@@ ge , with 300 police officers on June 22 , the police pat@@ rol official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown hous@@ eholders .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers with@@ drew from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is raising three children here , is particularly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection against the v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin @-@ based sen@@ ator and police force between house occup@@ iers and their neighbors , does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average and a high risk of poverty .
also house @-@ occup@@ ations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer road quite near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Mainz took place under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city district has become a magnet for tourists and ball@@ ots from all over the world in recent years : local residents of GDR times and former house occup@@ iers are now sharing their neighborhood .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they are recognized by dis@@ car@@ ded slices or newly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Left Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like bodily injury , according to statistics , are directed almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the crimes make tangible damage , which tends to hit new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ less : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not meant to be .
even the famous burning cars don &apos;t give it any longer directly in the ri@@ gs .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
this is why it was so important for her that the residents reg@@ ained their streets : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be removed : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is , in the end , con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here people who are not so good are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t endor@@ se violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
fru@@ stration comes on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are angry about colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who prefer should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub district , can complain badly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee deleg@@ ate
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of the Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger administration .
it sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugee aid , administration , public authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now here , the s@@ cour@@ ing wool @-@ mil@@ ky sau , which has above all a problem .
thus some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ed than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place .
searched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an em@@ bodi@@ ment of wo@@ ollen @-@ mil@@ k@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine says that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organisational , human and communication problems .
new containers soon on the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities .
responsibility changes from the administrative office to the municipality and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
the administration does not de facto find private apartments .
so far , it does not work , if one relies on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , communities need to be intim@@ id@@ ated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine says .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as reported Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also the administration and the volunteers are jumping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it is taking and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who eventually develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are problems , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a mamm@@ oth task .
a difficult question : are they afraid of radic@@ alisation after recent events , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some people may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk can and may not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins were completely re@@ inv@@ enting them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they don &apos;t have anything to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
