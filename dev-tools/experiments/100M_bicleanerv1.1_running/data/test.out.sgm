<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they drove home to the feed troughs in a fast gallop.</seg>

<seg id="9">And that ended the riding career again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even bother for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and with it also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid presented the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala for the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the likable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already spotted him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are not one in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the fact that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drastically go back to regulations, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has announced the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state-critical party's wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, there could be party-internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump is planning to build coal-fired power plants and to drive coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to cancel it." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment programme and demands:" "" "a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transcendental trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they just want to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better, for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump is trying to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rattle, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, which at least wants to demand from the rich, wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs set up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Foundation.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "Alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed contagious, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Putin's radiant, sustainable audacity showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater since it was committed by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veal is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were responsible for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved of his ministry in the last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey also shook him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulates it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, as it regards its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "moreover, the continued resentment over the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara, claiming that after the attempted coup d "état, he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described to me: two countries that are breaching from the West and feeling badly treated and now fading.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents were told at the press conference that they hadn't even striped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin dampens Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's closest trust.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Envoy for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin, it reads that without stating reasons, Putin has ordered the release of Ivanovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Committee. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, has been named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is said (in Russian) that later he was the Chief of the Administration and Chief of Staff of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state in respect of legislative bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest friends and works as he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule for the cameras, there are only a few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, at once directed the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to tell me this very complicated job - you could almost say - entrust a difficult post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as Putin, a former member of the Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached the power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as Putin's third term of office would have breached the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensland crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four sealings of the" "" "Deck blowers" "", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now in Rosyth a concrete deck for the deck, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first seal represents a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project is the closure of forward-looking high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower of the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">As the tolerances in which the team works were tiny - they were only a few millimetres on each side.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and Greens say: investors should be taken a lot more strongly in the future." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the SPD is proposing a" "" "housing concept for housing" "" "at the next council meeting." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all it's about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group President Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas will in future have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can, however, also be built on the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big controversy in the town hall is, however, the Bratmann said: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of homes as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still has to be financed, should provide incentives." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Bratmann said: "there is no agreement between the factions at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher constraints for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, Bratmann said, a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is still not completely: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compensate for the loss of more than 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of getting flats back to the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the Weststadt, deadlines run at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased, the aim of the so-called mixing is to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="31">There shouldn't be a concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will be still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "s & D Group president Holger Herlitschke believes:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer walk outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a series of animation, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand dropped at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be photographed (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when it was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person restores each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, recently informed Washington Post that within two days of market launch, the number of followup people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "" "30 minutes of time" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "" "on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercise regularly reduces their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also grumpy quirks that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it like?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though Smartphone Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On full line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast ring on Thursday became a multi-campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-Cameroon Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles contests on the floating-beam during the individual multi-campaign image of women in gymnastics during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth while she holds her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women's multi-campaign team at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long distance, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, trained in the Boorman, became strength.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was easily led by two turns, the picture deceives.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating bars and ground yarns - in which Biles holds the world title - watched.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the floating bar - and sat on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her tail, a pure formality - and tears flocked on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a vengeance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old team of team, called" "" "Grandma" "" "by the Americans, had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her clouding, she threw out kisses to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports that were published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year old girl were shot, who died in one of the deadliest attacks for a decade in the first series murderous assault by Phoenix while listening to the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, which is Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnastics throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to put it into the olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. it's also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner primarily in private gymnastics which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued as desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in prosperous suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to allow innumerable young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to make a more affordable and easy-to-use exercise training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turn-foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer young people high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic clubteam and thank you, you were motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors would like to organise more strikes after rejy's Het proposal rejected</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident doctors who voted in favour of a choice rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans to introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be found in a "No Man Land" and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first resident doctors are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekly calendar items in order to improve care at irregular times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee for Assistant doctors announced last night in a communication with: "assistance specialists still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and it will be given to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks gripped the government on reluctance to participate and sometimes on a deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a replenishment of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, because nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the Strip.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "the BMA wants a better weekendcompensation for the 54.000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, General Director of the NHS employees, called on the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the last two months we talked to the commonee of the assistance doctors and responded favorably with the Ministry of Health and other ministries concerning the concerns of guardianship and whistleblowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training sessions, additional training for those who return from vocational training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form bellies.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots causing the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The line-up of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from front or back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "if you get closer to you from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" "" "go out of the gun line" "", "says Mizrachi." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with his knee to the bar and twist the weapon out of his hands while the attacker is bent in front of pain. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the weapon and turn it, so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the Attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip, before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undergone his immune system and repulsion of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk switched his course to a euro ticket, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dropping any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment covered by the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of replacing the rinsing button of a tensile toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public handrails to railway stations to washing snaps from toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to live up to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse after their luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel movie "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that's getting close to what I've cleaned in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more mutinous than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here because it is disgusting here indoors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of probiotics at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying that we said" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to blame and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria in particular associated with the well-being of gastric and intestines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social apartment after a deloculment with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had holes, wooden boards were opened, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be not as nice as part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fighting with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and curses included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors told them that they had to fight on the street and had to call the police regularly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing gave her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have been working with the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the townhouse garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant refused to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as delogification is always the final step to consider Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the church who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled herself with the role of Mary in a youth room.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>

<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with melancholy about her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly, because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and bright and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it's clever, of course also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is very similar to me, my Italian character I have as a Roman," "" "laughs Bartoli." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">The regional elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because so far it's not going: summer holidays, heat and country elections - it's biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the electors, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not the locals, so do not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during holidays, helpers who hang on posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and count votes at the end are only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and last holiday of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let itself be passed over to the people by means of an election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer AfD cuts off and what is left at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the land, distributes roses and talks a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, counselor Merkel has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel blame for the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "your refugee policy, you" "" "We create this" "" "has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him a beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaign at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice been invited by Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's parliamentary group is located in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "this means cocaine, play only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noticed that on the ground, you crumble the base, that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again.</seg>

<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU voter champion Kokert on his comrades is also self-revealing:" "" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village protests, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats were last at 22 percent behind CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election in 2011, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into parliament." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>

<seg id="8">The meeting of those responsible for the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of tourist arrivals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg exists, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to be seen in the maps.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to breakthroughs in them allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some are less affected.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only it, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has answered a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where such a bit generously handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">For all lawsuits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently visited because of the complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot approach it, it is also very different elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his pedigree cuts back to the end of the rehabilitation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu, Göhner remembers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually purchases sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before committing to the comment section to review it under the pseudonym Non-Allevium Men's Intermediate with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougov, the reemergence of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the newness of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older ellers tend to retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of Yougov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and stuffy before I stop, hold my hands and say something stupid as: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I received from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of persons: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a vast number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought I was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I've conducted, people usually get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to followers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that disk stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received an impetus at the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that evoke blissful reminders.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a collector for me and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flirts from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month did not yet listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who purchase a record don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I smother through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came here only recently and said," "" "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead LP so that I can put them on the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts is the latest synthesizer and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it's good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but the psychic traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather casts a window bumper than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve a lot, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to have the impression of daring the pants for jeans, I watch a group of young girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of sheets of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of Yougov vote, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with the strolling through platings of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer clear of the starving look of an uncanny, thirty-year-old false presenter who stands above the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary businesses where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, offer barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which are a risk of fire and health.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that stores and restaurants are important as free meals offered by the state-supported associations and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids "Café des Birkenau, which is generally operated and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids "Café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle has increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed measurer: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashes are being tested which are intended to transfer Tempoizers particularly effectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer from the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accident-centers where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary blur for the observance of speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous measuring operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as driving bans by time, road and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the high-powered condition one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the finale on Thursday evening in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Dee Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji delivered a master class in handling, side-ping, back, line run and raw power to gain gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was beaten by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in this form, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in top form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation to GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis chief trainer Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost Ryan every match at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and let the attacks stop GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run into running busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau passed over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With still four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A rival Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but Fiji has only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute athjasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa has added a new member since the re-start and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided over more weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant midplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sultan whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame took the cake dot with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fief rang out, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked off in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in semi-finals with 20-5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown gave the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the prize - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the trainer's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotined gold as in these games, and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder stroke to the last 220 hard hers that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was alone when they rowed to the second Olympic gymnastics in a row without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter unfired use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athens gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumphal goose.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the herd, there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that can be operated and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term at all in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing on itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was a Captain of the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats only how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you goes to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very much at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, remain in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race as we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member communities are the municipalities of Kirchuth, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn Bürgermeisterin Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed General Manager of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very varied and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to weekend parties," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the start-up and inauguration of the new Fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new Fountain (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the repurchase of the high tank (1999), the new purchase of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no standstill and there was always new additions, because water is the most important food for people and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he really lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the district Unterfranken's water forum.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy.</seg>

<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well as well as the restructuring of the Zweckverband.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rupture at the elevated tank at Kirchuth on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can only maintain the supply of Neubrunn, because you filled up the high tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water-purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a certificate with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>

<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of China threw up massive steel on the world market in light of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers reject price dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a bit.</seg>

<seg id="27">In the German steel industry around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she taught music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "sing me emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total more vivid, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good to her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organise, to be able to leave and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the puste in everyday life as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Collaboration of Senior Citizens Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people wakes up many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia are declining themselves for long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special power is also required for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To focus simultaneously on one's own voice and a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="3">To her surprise, the mistrust also did not let the males cold - however, they always remained the same in the difference to the females.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of regression of cat babies at the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>

<seg id="6">Hangovers also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous study, the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the kittens screams is different with the urgency of their neediness.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a call of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "all the females, even those who had no offspring, responded differently to the screams," "" "Konerding said." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned to the loudspeaker more quickly, when the cry of the very excited kittens was playing.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be congenital or evolves with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "" "said the biologist." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who after a doping lock had sued her start right shortly before the games, was piped off mercilessly at her start (100 meters breast).</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a bizarre scene: with a smile she was still strolling in the hall and provoked her appearance.</seg>
<seg id="8">When she realized she wasn't going to get gold, the audience broke out into a cheering storm.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are still many other sportsmen who go to the start despite the doping past at the Olympic Games in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m / USA): the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was already locked for doping twice (2001 and 2006 until 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its spell, the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex-world champion is even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m-squadron / Jamaica): the two-time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six-month lock after having detected the dosage of the pain medication Oxycodon.</seg>

<seg id="18">The four furthest litters this year go to the account of the big gold favoritin.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-squadron / USA): the Beijing Olympics Champion and two-time World Champion above 400 m, had been positively tested and locked for 21 months in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="20">A means for penis enlargement have been responsible, devoted Merritt.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ivan Tichon (Hammer Throw, Belarus): hardly an athlete was subsequently recognized as many medals afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="23">Thus Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later, after having found testosterone doping with it.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 40-year-old had also had to give Olympic silver 2004 because of steroid doping and the 2006 European Championships because of testosterone abuses.</seg>
<seg id="25">The bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also given back by a ruling of the International Sports Tribunal CAS.</seg>
<seg id="26">At 80,04 m he is ranked second in the world rankings.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): the world record holder and Goldfavoritin was tested positive only in May, but may still start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="28">At the 29-year old world champion, clues were found on the capture of a forbidden health supplement, the lock of the world anti-doping agency WADA fell mildly and ran already on July 13.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to restricted areas and provinces," "" "said a speaker in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>

<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is staking behind the attacks.</seg>

<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are still smaller bombings, but most of the time they are not directed against tourists.</seg>

<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were conducted a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence also in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to foment chaos, while the country turned towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always do the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the bold appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overloaded swimmer from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>

<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte became viral internethite afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24 year old finished his race with a residue of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty character, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24 year old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more familiar.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.</seg>

<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>

<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported that under the approval of the budget, the administrative office Kulmbach established that undercover works for these sewage systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems for a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the body, a new calculation of the charges for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period will be equated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious agitator increases founded Schmidt on all three sewage systems for relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, lying between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past period of calculation, all three installations are not least incurred due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf sewage plant due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welshahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyors had to be overhauled and the first sewage sludge had to be removed after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to comply with the requirements of water law in the future.</seg>

<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtertool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that is already bordering on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are undaunted, self-winding tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscretions reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have raised critiques in the past where they were accused of promoting blackface conveyor or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "as this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" "" "yellow face." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies showed a greater problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced it would have disabled this feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended to pay homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an e-mail grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet were widely spread across the photos, wrote that the filter was" "" "vulnerable and gentle" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was dragged into the waning extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racist-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu critically criticized the large part white, just male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on its workforce diversity and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a personnel responsible, focusing on sub-represented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, on their part, said they closed their Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were permitted on-site, an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Committees, Intelligence Committees and the Military Commites, reports on great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information presented by high-level Centcom commanders typically marked a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed actual conditions locally and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened to Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom are up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct indication that government spikes under Obama gave instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves exposed to pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of Congress were much more positive than the facts." "" "the report stated." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom family publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it's so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015, the tips of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were added that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights into the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of Centcom reports are underway by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, said Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damaged morals among analysts and" "" "gave excessive room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats agreed not to have found any evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported cases of investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, which was received by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations also have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush looked forward to a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team points out that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there would have been no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger command, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of its excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after she had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3-0.</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last play of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will leave the strong Dutch for a little longer, leading the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may start on Saturday, Americans have sparked a surprising whirlwind through their success story four years after they landed at the last of the last London games in the last 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey stick in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became National Director of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="18">We have been able to pull the rudder completely around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a backgauge from the near area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball in the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. door keeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a barrel.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro's events feel steadfast and unavoidable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is passed from the wristband to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffeshop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who, for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it was perceived as sparsely the last 16 years that many who had questioned, did not know that it is an Olympic portas at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humoristic potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never-ending pop-up - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "" "jumping board" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winner jumping on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hulling and salt) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic programme, they are judged according to the execution, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-and-one athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must move on in their pursuit of gold, faster, upward and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the original wall, but also another highlight in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympic dream.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly upwards again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no curvature in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualifying and final hours will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 1.00 pm.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end rounds as part of a afternoon block from 14.00 on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by angling and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently suggested - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia came across the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of thousands of protesters were killed during clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen were shot and killed in tens of thousands of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist risks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, where dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or to prison, either killed or driven into the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seasim Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold on power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, would benefit from the turmoil and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of hinkering in the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was not until the last few years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies hiding where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians given that they gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas prospered, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high-lands, in politics and economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is largely dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who account for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian prime minister until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively nontransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting, which, according to information by analysts, were seemingly self-catered by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train and measurable progress in poverty alleviation.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amperic city, attacked by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray are becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronyflights across the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump states Obama's claim that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and intelligible to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its fellow campaigners who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of declaring statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump retired in regards to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement, he reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism levelled Mr. Trump while trying to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling polls.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he later explained "Of course, I said that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corroborative tone, because his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing on the attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to face him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries" "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true, in this sense, that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called it backbiters, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Minister for Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to expand by making it aggressive under control in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he tasted the" "" "poor," "" "twilight" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps's excuse as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a Faible for the refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on that day was somewhat more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "their latest collaboration," "" "A decent meal" "", "which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small local snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture did eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hackery, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rich foods were very popular," "" "said Brickman." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach as lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-in-can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Crews of women cooked for male rims and it was served fresh baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" records the ways with which the country was going to be no longer a land of land.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense topic," "" "Coe told why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious dishes such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," brickman noted that cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was at the heart of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar hybrids have been tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction prioritises over taste or even wholesome cooking skills.</seg>

<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before, or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - exaggerated the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housewives" and the challenge to transform the pampas such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historic treats." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially tasty are the reports of the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-food-attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant-house kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke like the million-million man of the world he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cooking like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and had a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a real stranger to reality.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would perhaps have made the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor urged him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the announcing of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting ones. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with eating, was discarded as soon as the country returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Brickman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Brickman's mother-in-law in writing the book - for example, how they could not throw away food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-hay usually only come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's hair has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland-shark swims down at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This loneliness, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "at least from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist assumed long that Greenland's hair will be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland hay is hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyles' lifestyles.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion, when they made six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks nevertheless make this shark: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and seek cadavers looking down from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-arks, which Fischer took between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lentists of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons try to dash large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the second smallest animal with 220 centimetres, the lentil centre, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all the larger Greenland harks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign length to an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at the age of 156 years, Greenland-hay with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not a coincidence that such methane emes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland quale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on asparagus flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse therefore is much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as soon as possible," "" "explains the currant of evolution biologist." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The mints from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Romspilgrimage of all the altar-strants in the next two years, the Church of Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Different pilgrimages were tested and eventually chosen for the Bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the holy rooms, went on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storz sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and distributed the pilgrimages.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer loved wife and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was assigned.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made rest to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parishes of the local parishes were available for the nights.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the stage of the stage Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller added for a tasty and starchy dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day was the stage after St. Peter, which was the most exhausting route, but at first the high heat had to climb around 500 altimeters and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathing softener in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God thanked God.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster, the Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropole.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner was the last evening in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio to glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had done to his own. the Jussel made the legend haughty when he stormed his home to win a victory from New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of the six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they scored a modest sixth place in London at the World Championships in London in spite of Hoys' resignation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Green.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner won an Olympic cord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lap fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, there was a hindrance that after a weak start he dropped intentionally to the railroad.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a superb victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said:" "" "it feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kennys it's possible to repeat Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will take part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They came to the finish in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition in which Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he fought with representatives before the qualification, when functionaries called him to himself to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shandong, Elinor Barker and Katie Archives soon of Milngavie in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton took place in April in the middle of sex and bullying penalties, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">The future of the smelting of Portland due to the abolition of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melt from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the supply contract and thus will unlock all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to give further subsidies to the plant operation.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt process consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation in Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry melt which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three further owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp keep smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL believes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by smelting," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions" that would have come into force as of November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on earnings to AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual subscription to the amount of $187 million in anticipation of termination.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "ability Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt" "" "does not affect." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation for why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts and Tomago to consume around 900 MW of electricity per year.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the clichéd act of almost every birthday of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a playsite at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With a view to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of Kardhian began with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim may have beaten her, as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September edition is a league for herself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a picture band rather than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the emitter 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the Bulletin still seep before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years, there were clearly more" "" "celebrities that mourn" "" "as" "" "Models, celebrities are" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she finds herself in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners doesn't like success for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her the mistletoe of the moment.</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cheered up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But riding around on the missiut seems to pass by at the point.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilo and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was also not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory initially consisted of eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "came just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in stores - and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can buy the equipment on the internet, but they are somehow originating from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as the "office in the western pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">Indeed, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit tormenting slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then they found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have guessed in August 1996 that communicator would become the beginning of the smart phone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms resembling those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have identified similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless turned slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun, which was 30 percent matter of matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its daylight side of the sun for almost two months," "" "stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously assumed by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to gather the complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in the star cluster to different rates, as well as in which context the rotational periods are associated with the development of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other starches, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sternenhaufen of the Pleiades is 445 light years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated some 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">To top rotational rates, these mature stars expel large amounts of constellations.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star alerts, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.</seg>

<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimming float Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre barrier runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically polluted athletics competitions, these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sport Court (CAS) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final about 100 m of butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the runs over 50 m of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested an opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and demands full co-operation with the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a communication:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sport Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for sanctioning the athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also at the night of Rio the news about the positive sample at Danekova ooked, the 33-year-old went herself to the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be food supplements," "" "said the athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report it is said that the blood doping agent EPO is involved in the banned substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-Probe should also have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately announced his criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday, the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "" "was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of athletes, Danekova's case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association banned the entire Russian team from the start, except for systematic doping, and also the Läufernation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the former treading in China caused violent clashes between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle, I want to hand over myself," "" "Lacourt said in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focus of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "said this." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2014, Sun had a positive effect on the trimethazide stimulant in the Chinese nationals, but only had to sit in a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: hacker succumbs her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 firms in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ransomware-blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to pay the money required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes in terms of attacks on company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom will be considerably higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprogrammes were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred in the past months frightening fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates according to a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it selectively searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database at stake, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware beat.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: pay not, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will receive their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites or decrypt free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of only a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware extortion, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the Anti-Virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per authenticated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually criminals employ spammers with spreading," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not sufficient threat to successful capture, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing programs," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential damage potential is much higher, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackers Conference of Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the little HR-V Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a mini van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work closely at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and pleasant, only the cockpit-top falls down there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles while storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l at high and 1026 l at inverted backrests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is up to a height of 1.24 m from the floor.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his work a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is still another motorization: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top version" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision alarm sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the recognition of traffic signs and throttles the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the freeway feeder</seg>
<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the ypass road - here is a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the right-wing bend is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all the motorcyclists who are driving on the surrounding road every night in traffic jams, when driving over the motorway towards Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), the state-owned road construction extends in the area between Hammer Road and the exit Weser Straße the right-bending track by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is spread early, whereby the overall flow is improved on the busy section of the federal highway 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representing Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the train station bothers the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays the return trip extends up to the bridge over the Alberghan route and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason for this is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weser Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here traffic is only deflated one lane over the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back over a quarter of a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to double-gauge the heavy load traffic.</seg>
<seg id="15">As long as this bottleneck and the associated work-day traffic jam will last, the competent state company cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, with years to expect: because the bridge has an official remaining duration until 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the extension of the right-wing bend, the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is far from the wake-up ringing no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders and there can be many causes for them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping Difluence and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what one understands for the time being is the insomnia, thus an intransience and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just staying asleep many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German GP association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not unusual that sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is frequent above all in depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors cause each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to salute about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, he advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any resident sleeping doctor in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, when sleeping problems first contact the family doctor, she advises.</seg>
<seg id="24">He can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, snoring with breathing exhausts, in case of abnormal heartiness, for sleepwalkers or when one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only please do not take a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After clinging, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "wear counts on: regular sleep and stopping times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, avoid watching television to sleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, civil investigators from Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bags and luggage racks as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 p.m. civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to the police officers from past thefts.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July this year and had worked in a common, labour-friendly manner and especially professionally.</seg>
<seg id="7">The experts of the crime commissariats 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves, who had entered Germany in order to commit crimes to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of lime trees, still a remnant of cobblestones in between: the Rīga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like that at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leased contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin-based senator handle had advocated a harsh treatment of the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the police cleared the premises on the ground floor, the cadaforge, with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrol official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown householders.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, is particularly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection against the vandaliating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin-based senator and police force between house occupiers and their neighbors, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house-occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer road quite near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainz took place under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city district has become a magnet for tourists and ballots from all over the world in recent years: local residents of GDR times and former house occupiers are now sharing their neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized by discarded slices or newly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "Left Autonomous Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like bodily injury, according to statistics, are directed almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the crimes make tangible damage, which tends to hit newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is weightless: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not meant to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars don't give it any longer directly in the rigs.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important for her that the residents regained their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be removed: through faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "that is, in the end, condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here people who are not so good are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can't endorse violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">Frustration comes on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who prefer should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub district, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee camp for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the Achim Grockenberger administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugee aid, administration, public authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now here, the scouring wool-milky sau, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less ridiculed than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an embodiment of woollen-milksau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "Regine says that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers soon on the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the administrative office to the municipality and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">The administration does not de facto find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, if one relies on private apartments, such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communities need to be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine says.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as reported Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also the administration and the volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it is taking and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually develop the feeling that he can't help in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "there are problems, however," "" "he says honestly," "" "People with whom nothing works." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalisation after recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine's customer says quite clearly," "" "what some people may call naïve." "" "a residual risk can and may not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins were completely reinventing them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they don't have anything to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary authorities have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">The politicians are afraid to answer this question clearly.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we have not arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would unwind the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy integrating the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
