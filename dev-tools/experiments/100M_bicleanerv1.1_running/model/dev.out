Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing policies in the Middle East .
the meeting also aims to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing housing development and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will for the peace process .
by the deal signed by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has continued to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not agreed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election in Israel that was im@@ min@@ ent at that time .
in an emergency call is admitted to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Political Police Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the disa@@ strous distress at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty contains 17 members , and many students visited courses from both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something with him was wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the doctorate , for whom Lamb had worked so hard , would have no guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun at the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of Lam@@ bs long lasting friends described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and the Lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar play several years ago .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , 40 and lived in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play finished in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were sitting and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt were also part of the Mah@@ n@@ wache in which he sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plan to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that there won &apos;t be so many Christmas seasonal workers like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that it will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to set up 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season of 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were employed .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with interviews and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to furnis@@ h stores with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I realise that the seat next to me is empty , and I gradually realise that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it seems to me that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and a length of length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the meeting of the Council of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackl@@ ing the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 surveys that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a breakdown .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans are trying to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was delivered to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start dropping their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six of ten Republi@@ cans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first State of State of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they expose their hon@@ esty , Republi@@ can voters keep pumping for real . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey from last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P constitu@@ ents Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign can be seen as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating every one .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ pump support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvesting the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a small majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have set their votes firmly .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of ten Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his electoral campaign two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic mode of withdrawal from Tr@@ ump will hold decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage new orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of ten Republi@@ cans tell that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it appears to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status .
six of ten Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider rather than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential districts
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the H@@ ook@@ en@@ weg - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
in the street , a square meter of a street roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is limited naturally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , however , the price is just like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well @-@ recorded .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a barrel .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a supreme kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e launched a dream start in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Pir@@ äus in the Hex@@ enk@@ dron of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won the champi@@ ons League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack@@ ers ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally want to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller took part in the Champions League for the Bavarian Leadership in the Champions League for the help of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who caused a shot of the world champion to pass as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ speaking words . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and engaged performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud to stum@@ ble in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too in@@ ventive in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were initiated too often by the shift to the left on the left side of Douglas Costa , which was seldom seen by the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion for@@ gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms Ide@@ ally Brown struck the Pol@@ es &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by a direct table , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians mar@@ ched their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle pen@@ cils .
on Tor@@ door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was deser@@ ted .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ als over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola let Guardian defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Board member Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the defeated Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later .
in front of the game , there was a crash in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans in its spect@@ ator block obviously provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and approached the Munich fans .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , do not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : with ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Science ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth by 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had watched more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
major causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphasizes the authors .
smoking and loss of teeth therefore return to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years for the endanger@@ ment to fall back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained the author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
people must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , study leader H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to the high age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness were affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come across the rem@@ n@@ ants of the late anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have been excav@@ ated , Museum Director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department of archae@@ ology for soil conservation .
in the third part of the Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists were now found to find what they were looking for .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman from freight train captured
the Federal Police asks the people for help after a young woman is caught in the train station .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. , the woman crossed the railway line towards the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train that came from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .

EU Commission proposes a new trial in the dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to shar@@ pen the dispute about the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration equipment for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to clearly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the launch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate specifically that the EU states and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new Federal Court of Investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time , a second instance is fores@@ een .
it would allow for obj@@ ection to judgement .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ ers , and there was no obj@@ ection to their sentences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment tri@@ bunal according to their own data .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) required by large companies are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , the companies can contest damages on behalf of tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act identified the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as big progress .
in the wake of the reform , the Commission took into account essential points that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out with other EU trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government too welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
this means that particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it was still unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is deemed to be no longer durable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy @-@ looking fol@@ ks@@ y has recorded with felt pen in Mich@@ igan , a picturesque US state .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of different places , which he always records on the map , what his meticul@@ ous and tender arranged songs tell .
where they came up and how it looks , in his homeland .
St@@ ev@@ ens has since proven to be wonderfully creative .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late 60s , but can drift into opul@@ ent opul@@ ence at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be squ@@ ander@@ ed in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a comprehensive masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ rowing of ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and lacks in any yearly list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic items of sale .
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage dé@@ cor .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five @-@ piece band through Germany .
in the dark ham@@ burger More !
he mainly presents the Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell available since March .
even though nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without judging the audience , the band plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you can hear from the audience that the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the record .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ c@@ unda
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is anticipated with tension at the Prime Minister &apos;s question .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s trial and for the first time put on David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six pre@@ dict@@ ated questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be audi@@ ted by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a shadow cabinet member and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has spark@@ ed criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several front @-@ page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two @-@ night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of Shadow Mini@@ stries have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also follow within the Labour &quot; foot@@ steps , &quot; namely to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour introduced changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23.@@ 000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too con@@ front and that he is subject to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stroke and stri@@ fe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and has decided instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic Council , will be represented if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which was often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the interview with the Prime Minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position among his fellow parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed extensive reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply to data , which indicates a rise in the United Kingdom wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most issued estim@@ ation since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index reached an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont was 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion through a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a drop of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his estim@@ ation for the company rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports grew by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labor cost of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin

the type with the plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 rot@@ ates through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you are living I@@ dol , whose poster belongs to St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much on the day as their Mama E@@ wa deserves half a year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the Gymnasium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory education ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bie@@ ber himself is not .
he has already taken care of .
for the promotional period of the Super@@ man , he cas@@ hed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company flus@@ hed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he and over the counter , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ hes .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the window @-@ window .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that the new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in place 1 in the USA and the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to the idea of a potato d@@ öner
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both are in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster during a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the wording &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the shop has a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multic@@ ultur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the Lebanese Association has now submitted the idea to the patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with his customers .
met@@ a starts soil resistance campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di boost in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ a has launched a soil stability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ ers and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual investment strategy day .
there is a lot on the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million sales per year and by cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens up 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on a high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars in earnings before interest and taxes , &quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ alli@@ c loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s sales and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , talked about a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ a will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board was contacted by Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ Gas Market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s food and food trade , which has supplied about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction despite the simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , with@@ ers and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal sales prices with col@@ es and vo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores due to fast growing fresh food and to provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and load @-@ recovery programmes on El@@ an will grow and hope that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit again for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is rather deserves praise as criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ gos and , according to the President of the Australian tennis federation Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the not@@ orious conflict of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp was sh@@ ook up a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was defended ste@@ ad@@ fast .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite excited about is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s trained hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z &apos;s decision on the important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversy &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has quickly made the climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to escape illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled before violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cry offensive against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a strict meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the out@@ dated Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged on Tuesday to call on a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a prompt action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stood out on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is planning to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers were deployed at the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became the entry point to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people attempting to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes committed under the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounding the main crossing of the border near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process man &apos;s data and press a crowd to push for it .
about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ in@@ ating on a national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the primary elections ( 58 per cent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the Democratic constitu@@ ents of prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the election , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support among men has dropped mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has dissi@@ p@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a five @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of prim@@ aries across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
one neighborhood would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and voters will also be quoted .
as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one @-@ third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead will increase in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five and fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; selectable &quot; is increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic constitu@@ ents call questions about elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these constitu@@ ents of prim@@ aries is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters of prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister continue to be questioned , most Democratic constitu@@ ents of the election are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their views altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was wor@@ sen@@ ing .
they are mostly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voters are not trust@@ worthy and un@@ trust@@ worthy throughout the country .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks in the lead .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic constitu@@ ents in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to a nationwide survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two candidates meanwhile have dropped half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l , and others are losing dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son plays well in demographic groups and sur@@ passes tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , was kno@@ cked off with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the lowest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey was Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is growing in the poll@@ s , with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are measured only remotely , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
swimming @-@ temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College new@@ bies
almost two years after a student died during a mon@@ strous ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people are submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood were brut@@ ally attacked by Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a ritual ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and was repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call for the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members started to hide the fossi@@ ls and , in principle , set the welfare of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sig@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly suffered injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies from the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ i &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe suggested a charge of murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia attacks and forming a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national fr@@ at@@ ernity has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rise is coming , and the hous@@ eholder will fall into conten@@ tion , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little instruction on how to proceed .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not concentrate when it begins to increase interest rates but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find out that the whole excitement was potentially over@@ stated because of an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &apos; cheap money &apos; era , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects .
here , a view based on historical trends is how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can be volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency for assets to be accounted for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is usually rising - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the development cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants were posted all year round on the interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trade has only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all development cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists quickly put in the shade after the beginning of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds tend to be faster than shares when they change their strategic direction .
bonds appear to change direction once the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the scor@@ ing cycle , the newcom@@ ers immediately fell , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds closer and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher earnings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting that Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest has increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing has increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large and large companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity with their shares exceeded their equi@@ val@@ ents with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains from higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that it does something the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also went to BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what &apos;s already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and enligh@@ tenment to the public .
what I am learning from Radio 3 , I will never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er efforts should be made to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport came under fire to kick off commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins grab@@ bed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced &quot; in particular BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts a series of entertainment next time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August and Black Friday could be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday stopped spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developing over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases using their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting itself , and we will possibly experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 issues a little over £ 1 was spent online .
for some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now being carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion labels in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial pris@@ ons in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia e@@ vic@@ ted the collapse partially of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the kill@@ ings that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the route to clo@@ the their respect when the first of the dead stepped their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning procession went past the holy place , where only days before a building crane broke through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for bur@@ ial when the Saudi king suspended a sanc@@ tion on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 star@@ ters who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ ch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group should not have let the arm of the crane be stopped when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man praised what caused the fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the Great Mo@@ lich@@ é , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month .
the bin Laden group did not publish statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ que as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .

British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has sur@@ passed
this means that 200 more scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q will close points of sale nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home .
if you can deal sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
British employ arti@@ sans more and more to perform DIY jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , who offer services at low prices , is now out@@ dated .
for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open up 200 further scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men and close 60 points of sale by B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions are taken by women .
at the moment , men prevail among the employees .
she said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that show more female single @-@ households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to move this more towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients comprise women with 80 percent of their decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of five women listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deport@@ ation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of power .
he was acqu@@ itted of this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ sed that between 2006 and 2011 , the def@@ end@@ ants used funds from the association accounts which they could disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial mis@@ si@@ les .
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point in time an asset of the association was created .
the sports officials were only expecting expense and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the Pas@@ si@@ va in 2001 amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we carry the club forward or lock us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread profession large audi@@ tors of the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insur@@ ances down as security with the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely admini@@ ster the money , you are not allowed to make any debts .
furthermore , with appropriate financial success the withdrawal of expenses compensation had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expenditure damages was paid out years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
as a result , l@@ ump sum and not detailed bookings seemed to have appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings .
the accounts and austerity books shared the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial support , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 1@@ 20.000 Euro was transferred to the association &apos;s account against the one function@@ ary .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account was due to the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally thought that he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association was never damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent salary , he only charged o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documentation for the early years could not be presented to the def@@ end@@ ants .
these were no longer kept after an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second def@@ end@@ ant also referred to mil@@ eage money .
in his statement , he explained in his statement that all these deport@@ ations had to be carried out in cash , to which he had to leave the international market to the bank to lead a bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard posts further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years , the computer shoulder will be disman@@ tled when the company spl@@ its up .
there is no end to the sub@@ missions from Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the amount of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
in this way costs are to be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share listed 2.3 percent on the stock exchange .
the Corporation from California , Pal@@ o Alto , grown with printers , is now split up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services , recently added the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds were thus returned in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to the change in the industry by spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted quite late to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and are getting more and more businesses online .
a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs are envis@@ aged by Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be mostly rejected : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 per cent agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that other states are flying combat strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
24 percent are opposed to interfer@@ ing with the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperation with the Syrian regime , Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents rejected 20 percent of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
at the centre of the fair are connected cars as well as electro@@ mobility until 27 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can attend the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organizers of V@@ DA &apos;s Auto Union expect about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water he@@ aders against several hundred refugees at the Serbian border .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and a water @-@ designer stood behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set pep@@ per@@ mint .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
the group was then dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was removed from the zone .
children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out .
other refugees s@@ add@@ led together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank meets on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half the last week of the opinion was that the F@@ ed will do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will be 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may leave the null zone and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relations .
it has warned the markets to focus on an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death penalty at Delta State University leaves debt cancellation
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleague on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency department that police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb sailed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said .
the police said that Lamb had kind@@ led relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he does not go to jail . &quot;
when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University in spring 2015 .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had a few stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly strug@@ gl@@ ed with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all of this surely demands its tribute .
eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa puts the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year with a better organisation alone .
150 of the approximately 1000 executives around the world will cost the work@@ station of the Group .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot &apos;s union .
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and upgrades the cheap capital Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business in the future .
the airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings as Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employee has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
during the Tari@@ ff conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations for the Stri@@ ke Stri@@ ke should be resum@@ ed on this Thursday .
this divided the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , the cockpit would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to achieve stable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it fores@@ ees that in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is competing in the group &apos;s own cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this brought the left out@@ ward def@@ enders to cry and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double construction and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be laid tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then that happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the dressing room .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ metre .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK defence team has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , they are all very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg wre@@ ck when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball which was in a different direction , so that it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ law published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , re@@ produces a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ re@@ z@@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an Un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the cov@@ eted Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , slu@@ gg@@ ish essence , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most probably such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral district office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
to hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity on test level , is an option for the attack .
referring to this message : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that ti@@ cket@@ eers are geared to results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago the run of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton won nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first put Jonathan despite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I highly inc@@ ite .
he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would give an extra spin Bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t strike there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cra@@ p of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred inst@@ ant@@ aneous sens@@ ations and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari joins the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ee , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy by heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Go@@ ing out of Britain from the EU ) could gain access to allow@@ ances if the economy goes into a slu@@ gg@@ ish economy by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s dis@@ gor@@ ged ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper with every day even without the choice of genius Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently fell apart for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes , which they usually do not want are full . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes a UK @-@ looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it happened in the exc@@ essively long persist@@ ing like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is difficult to imagine that they will tear themselves off a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may intentionally not plan helpful notes , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on their cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not support during the 1975 @-@ inspired referendum , which supported our 1973 entry with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who have made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ odd ban@@ anas &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ foreigners , most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened up a backdoor .
the press has never denied it either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to waste me anymore - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ he years , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;m very friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most of the people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ Cancer Ten@@ den@@ cy and the wild Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ men can probably say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ett &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said , when the sc@@ outs in him fought to not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father insist@@ ed on TV to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their party on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ett Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital ? - they also have suspi@@ cious elec@@ tors - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of when I started on Monday , what was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO had previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T on public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not provided , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part in the Tob@@ acco leadership of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products damage &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what is evidence and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers vis @-@ à @-@ vis tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not at risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should cease sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be ordered or sent that would be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ sided is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this public television should be .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Don@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that BBC shows like East@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ j@@ unk programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that one gets a great value for £ 150 a year here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday demanded that the BBC verify its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To inform , train and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of the public television stations in Australia and Canada to &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by break@@ ages of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are heard with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mo@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ azi@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depth @-@ brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ onic channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when ultras@@ onic applies to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mo@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impulses of light in and out .
but Chal@@ azi@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus make it possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ azi@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and underground trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important Anno@@ unc@@ ement : from 15th to 18th September , take the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line that turns into a picture of a tank .
in September a flock of arms dealers will drive with the DL@@ R ... Customers will be asked to help at the stop of the weapons fair .
the 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum für cruel Designs in Bank@@ sy D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective , named Special Pat@@ rol Group , helped the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys claimed to have access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and Doc@@ ent at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries .
many artists engage with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade posters sal@@ utes commuters in the subway .
the am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works for non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist , who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned all around the advertising campaign for the trade fair - by a blank of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic and sh@@ ady corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the blu@@ ish in bright colors and animation it remains sti@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair dates from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors p@@ ave fantastic eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ tically products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , I as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old moved into a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those whom I have been anno@@ yed - and the numerous long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entrance into the residence halls ranges from slightly rainy to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to cry out : people tell where you are coming from , whether and where you have taken Sabbath year , where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning in fire and those fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people get .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear themselves and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not forget to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert is given a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closing through che@@ eks .
as you start the university at the peak of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck at the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat result in people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to their milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors if it &apos;s a matter of telling them a bit more quietly , because at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep another two hours before she let down her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be ab@@ ys@@ mal embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , ran@@ gle her , get rid of her again and then see her every day , and perhaps experience how she draws together all common friends .
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot fellow @-@ resident is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to persu@@ ade your submission a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good chis@@ el is funny , but it only takes moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not t@@ ack its hol@@ dings at the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner house town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees don &apos;t need home , but also the single mother and the Ger@@ ing @-@ servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a large part .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient housing space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a row house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of flats .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consist of three residential units each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have construction regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ d : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building legally I have gone through my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated , it is always the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking space regulation .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined , who in a terra@@ ced house manages three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were those who accused me of creating luxury structures for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ deb@@ u : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we &apos;ve built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the Ger@@ ing @-@ ear@@ ners .
I show how you can build cheap and well today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some stum@@ bled upon problems after the installation , because they received an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is un@@ loaded during the update or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may switch to half @-@ way and this could lead to an abor@@ tion of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who held over 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which pres@@ ided over Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent finding should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district Office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; Alten@@ markt &quot; Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Sozial@@ stiftung and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg square .
apart from consultations one can also take part in courses there .
the Sozial@@ stiftung pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice from now on for questions such as nursing insurance or benefits of health care and nursing staff .
for years we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nour@@ ishing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in@@ frequently many services of the insur@@ ances are not avail@@ ed , because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the City Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , it is possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in the demographic shift .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure necessary in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the lon@@ el@@ iness of age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising presence . &quot;
this makes the Sozial@@ stiftung a great contribution for sen@@ iors to live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says about the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young man and hit his face with his f@@ ist .
the victim suffered from the nose and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends appe@@ aled and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim first .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator persecuted the group with a passenger car to their home and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car anymore , the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male figure .
with the help of a whi@@ p , one hit the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue item description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor , Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is at the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then , he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ lows of years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who currently completed their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and will also come into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was ready , I simply ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Mu@@ eller liked the idea of doing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees being his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a leading emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 Euros will be provided by the Müll@@ ers as part of a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice every quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor is found , it would have gone too .
he who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation also continues to look at familiar faces : the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power take over from the ri@@ ms .
with their f@@ arewell an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel says , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly after the long time already felt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also brought up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
however , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slov@@ ene does not want to seal its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill obligations , otherwise the system won &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the near ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country , with about 4,000 refugees , comp@@ acted with Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border of Serbia , which was around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard Hungary closed , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west distance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen Member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners since then have consistently issued a good testimony concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the minister of the Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently be a very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like voluntary workers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s up spontaneously to the chal@@ k and &quot; watch my life , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again small discussions develop on the edge about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .

this is why this promotion of public relations is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves on the boards is understandable , but after all , it is a very personal matter .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result Mi@@ xed , Financial Vi@@ ews Re@@ duc@@ ed for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier gi@@ ants lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its transportation services .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said that earning a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May will be 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts .
analysts predicted $ 10.@@ 84 $ according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set .
the lower view , despite the price increases , will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average , and will take effect on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for transporting shipments of heavy and large packages , which will be raised in November .
the company said that the result was nonetheless expected to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in the online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , twelve of the analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , bringing the sales in its unit Express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has raised the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on its most awa@@ ited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is located lo@@ oming over them at the end of the adorned , two @-@ storey meeting room .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all the other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented drop in short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest in federal securities - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing to watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at Mak@@ ler@@ ei Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average was 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % on 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ky , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy can deal with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , Princip@@ al Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world picked up at the end of last month , after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average figure fell by more than 16 % in May as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would throt@@ tle global growth .
this month the market has recovered a little while D@@ ow is now almost 10 % lower than May .
for the F@@ ed representatives market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation when it is to raise interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put on re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the world economy &apos;s health is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency office became the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke &apos;s then , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; their monetary expansion triggered con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only super@@ vise developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Financial Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that seem to be not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
co@@ ater , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ating interest rates quoted in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives turned back these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam P. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination of Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are getting upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should rush ahead of time .

try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
preparing you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still enjoys teaching with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande strengthens nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS seeks to elu@@ ci@@ date women how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , demonstrated that a healthy diet affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the sports hall of 2.3 million euros .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for the solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ out on the Bern@@ ese sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee had previously decided , among other things , an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ central first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned use of the roof area for solar systems is the background of the planning : &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which is supposed to be under ten degrees for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan with regard to the roof inclin@@ ation allowed no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ese Municipal Council is usually more restric@@ tive in the case of exemp@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project in the DIY sector : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics hall at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and of S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected by school and mass transport .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now presented to the Federal Council of the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is to be closed sooner than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is reflected in the surprising plans of the District GmbH of the Land@@ kreis district , which confirmed the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the Supervisory Board , however , will make a decision on this , and the meeting will take place next Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees would be employed at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man , &quot; who agreed to take over the lead from October 1st and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this occurred in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
for the next two years fisher@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day @-@ psychiat@@ ry accommod@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as a chief physician for more than 30 years , I have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

hunting with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district of Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police informed .
after a firing ceremony a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
it was unclear at first how exactly it could come to the accident .
the det@@ ective police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
the police of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate passed a crime suspect .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to have killed the young people and cast their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ h@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police informed on Wednesday .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is also considered to be a suspect , who in fact admitted the indication and carried out investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen as agreed .
in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in the event of interviews in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities said that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the channel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be introduced to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to blame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decision on the near@@ er circumstances of action shall bring the further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with incoming refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing units .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social Res@@ idential Development .
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as an asylum seek@@ er in a first @-@ hour accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising numbers of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that is getting bigger from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of accommodation in shared flat share rooms .
young adults stayed no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the lu@@ te on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has dropped again for the first time .
to solve the problem , the &quot; Social Res@@ idential Building &quot; alliance is propos@@ ing a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing sector .
this means that the land tax will be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be subject to a limited period of time .
in addition , attractive tax @-@ related amor@@ tis@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the alliance .
the support programme for refugees from the state bank Kf@@ W is already well connected with cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available EUR 300 million were already available on Monday evening at 184 million euros .
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia turn into a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no getting through to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about setting up a corridor for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , are also practically eliminating the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country Croatia .
most of the media reports have been reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t come across borders .
the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance should quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , almost no more refugees arrive in Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 fallen men .
shortly before the closing ceremony on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prohi@@ bit the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned thre@@ aten to jail sentences of up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 applications for asylum applications have been accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; tran@@ se@@ zones &quot; set up at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
practically no one has a view to grant asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers have been disman@@ tled and one of the records in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the goal of this reconstruction .
after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria will reach only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government officials .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for Germany to continue their journey .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
smaller groups of refugees gathered in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the ti@@ dying when suddenly ten people were standing with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly adjusted the traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the refugee flow , the Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
first we had the unexpected guests to@@ asted , with snack and drinks .
we said , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded tension passengers had switched from a ICE into a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els in order to make it possible after the short notice that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to cross the border .
but the regional train was shut down in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn before the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent other tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp to establish structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has raised the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis district of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the border areas with chao@@ tic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too will have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands to do with the support of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former massive Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen acquisition centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday is also without a big vor@@ tex , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the federal states , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor @-@ General .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ g@@ ings for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will explain how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that the trans@@ duc@@ ers have to comply with a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the upper ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , Konrad proves with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further to the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear the costs of the republic , as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own search for districts has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz demands better distribution
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since people are currently able to accommodate those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of an emergency , however , other locations should be tested for their suitability .
the city chief critic@@ ises the breakdown of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has also added further action on Monday in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no longer any special moves with refugees to Germany .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany by regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that Austria again carries out controls at its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; D is included , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later also to acquire them .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promising : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T in the plant , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Province of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center from Linz AG for 60 years .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the centre of the new shop .
J@@ utta incu@@ b@@ ated a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old Li@@ a Per@@ oni owner in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade in short : after all , she has now gained a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell , among other things , bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz large @-@ room that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has got her fashion interest in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women get into rap@@ ture when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman can also not answer last safety .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag re@@ stores every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this feature unites some also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for upright .
whether it is alien@@ ated from a foreign standpoint , journalists acc@@ use or gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office whi@@ r@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire originate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ ont @-@ hair@@ do is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er on the wine @-@ road .
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant place is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
K@@ all@@ stadt Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ stadt has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , among which also Tr@@ ump is the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to the Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it there to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , it also tends to say that &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt around , was &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
Tr@@ ump therefore comes from the village of investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company was the first purchase of real estate in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not take Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared a movie start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks more dist@@ anced to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so crum@@ bling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension whi@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been as he had , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sunrise dominated the reviews despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shift in the testim@@ oni@@ als for Today .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal state , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this det@@ ri@@ ment of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sunrise featured 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number fell short of last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .
in August , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , sunrise offers an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at today &apos;s 3@@ 14@@ ,000 .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect this dawn more than the Parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ er@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle on New Zealand &apos;s coast with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily beat The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , led by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , resulted in 44@@ ,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the last three agree : Bachelor of Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparent who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may have accidentally issued an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves ly@@ rical about why wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become their answers to the game destroy who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went to the house and I ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed that they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week told her that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly hired on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sulph@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bench when he lost a bar@@ gain , as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League converter did at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also to the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies to the mill in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it certainly was not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters demand the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn break when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free Di@@ et Parliament appeals to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually , completely different main topics were envis@@ aged .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by free elec@@ torate meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the c@@ law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as during the Yugosla@@ vian wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not possible , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Syrian leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum law@@ suits : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in the big wall@@ pap@@ a is not to fall under the table .
many years of long @-@ standing bur@@ ners are on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the &quot; intermediate plus &quot; pilot project at 47 secondary schools in which an extension of the upper secondary school of three to four years is being tested .
but that does not go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools that want this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free ride at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , executive district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
twenty polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known for being able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the ma@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent alter@@ cations since 10 .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have agreed on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mandu this week , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are no specific offers .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct vicinity to the Art Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
what investor is asked is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts had been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Great Street , just a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several semi @-@ tra@@ ilers are more worried - they fear the sale of their leisure joint
for months , it had been negotiated , gri@@ pped , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors .
now there are plans for a new holiday house on the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went to the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euro investment project has been under discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , propriet@@ or and member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge block over@@ looked by all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that traffic should increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come to make this happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is happening on the well @-@ known area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the construction plans were even more variable .

Google launches double @-@ funding campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google , Inc . ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund campaign to raise $ 11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation call on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / have been doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , driven by more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya torn by war .

weight loss surgery may be helpful for obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity treatments for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight relative to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity @-@ surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the patients suffered from diabetes completely and 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes completely dissolved only in one percent and in some cases with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the ga@@ stron@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) compared to the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a theme that is increasingly attrac@@ ting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
so even in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tually , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethical studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama pra@@ ises Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack on 11 September and found out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he replaced violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase from taking wall disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic palm @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ ses in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres report , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going out in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said some kids visi@@ bly drink dis@@ infection while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants only drink due to a cheap experience .
teenagers have pur@@ ported mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mouth water to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ ers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few inj@@ ections can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the broad@@ ca@@ ster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was deemed to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez advised parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection di@@ aries and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ der@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to wall disinf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the em@@ ailed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and demonstrated disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a collision at the cross @-@ gap between Nordr@@ ing and on Her@@ mit , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been injured easily in case of a collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old lor@@ ry driver drove towards the round@@ about in the direction of the industrial area and it was too late that two vehicles ahead of the round@@ about had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audio track and pushed it to a front @-@ standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
the accident involved vehicles caused damage of about 10,000 euros , shares the police with .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready to ride and had to be tow@@ ed .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they do not show any highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian director s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead , followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really need really the support of Cel@@ tic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful during January transfers
despite his comments , a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he was looking for some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to dis@@ rupt the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic @-@ target person Mich@@ u with reference card
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period , has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract runs out at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ le for two years and has not made the passage from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts dis@@ continued on S@@ FA battles due to N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Defender &apos;s Red Card was later repe@@ aled - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no doubt about integrity , I have not commented on any performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ ran@@ ny
the in@@ significant hi@@ ve was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts via Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; it is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot;
Tann@@ en@@ ius supervisory board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admit that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son &apos;s trust in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ nel@@ ly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amed that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton &apos;s policies to win a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ ph@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or songs that have not won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is rising overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ed with the process
because the security guards were unable to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the stur@@ geon into custody .
a respir@@ ation test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the teen@@ ager was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 pro@@ cur@@ es and stayed initially in custody .
why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
some later today , with the exception of late legal intervention , I will watch a man be brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may view exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will see it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have phr@@ ased it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe there is a strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he over@@ talked the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters from a police officer attempting to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a domestic peac@@ eke@@ eping incident in pel@@ vis .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
master foot@@ b@@ aller Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried swimming across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives for the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity @-@ department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ g sample at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do it , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity team had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , reig@@ ning president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should that bring me to the view that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behaviour and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it right now .
but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have developed with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt analysis , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching added that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the slaugh@@ tered Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly put mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like last night .
it could have been the whole day like that .
but it was also the same on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals because of claims to ring games
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of his player &apos;s Tac@@ kl@@ ing as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring Games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team have allowed the team during the high @-@ storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a barely cover@@ t note to the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in R@@ ingen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ king of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team gave him a confident voice , because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about w@@ rest@@ ling when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real center of gravity and that has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs R@@ oo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the outcome ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that in a phase we will meet them .
the Storm team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Serbian $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ dress
a man who could possibly have a lifetime penalty due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and landed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the advoc@@ ate of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 in security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reports daily with the police and stays at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in the direction of Basel before a permanent construction site .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident causing damage was completely demoli@@ shed .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage to the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros was incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately alar@@ ming her mother .
the police took care of the five images , then analysed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web @-@ research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction to be addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were conducted by him , but said that it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was ill in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images taken by children on 14 June last year , to have bre@@ ached the conditions on 25 January of this year and not to appear before court at a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Greg@@ or S@@ im advised that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael hur@@ ries the judgement until October to get background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a deposit in this case , but was held in custody for other cases due to hearing .
he was added to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the sentence .
bad user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left people at smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn on the border river Inn on Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ u@@ bs to the German side .
there they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
in the Munich Central Station , more refugees once again arrived on Wednesday , according to Federal Police figures , compared to the start of the week .
by 8 : 00 alone , some 700 people have arrived in the provincial capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , refugees reached the city on Tuesday in 17@@ 59 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prec@@ ursor of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against pet@@ als in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air is currently blowing in the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart informed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in the past few days , is the powerful low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years , the auto @-@ showers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ sold , are among the most popular in the compact car .
cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of force ( KBA ) in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel offers an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , with three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is the only five @-@ door Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in addition to the new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan plan intends to find its position in the strongly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully integrates itself into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger presented above all hand at the front end : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were fitted with LED technology .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ otainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the revised Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the At@@ tor@@ ney General Te@@ gel who lived for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , they can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separate .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer &apos;s statements , was now on a free foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
although his term of liability was due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin , he failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for a renewed examination .
they see the human dignity of the man injured .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were significant , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Jud@@ gment now has to clarify the amount of compensation for money .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they first spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff lived for three months between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
therefore prisoners are locked up again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of offspring , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming up in Germany will give you the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , flats are annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as was built up to now ( 250 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these especially advantageous apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from now 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
far too little is that from the viewpoint of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to arise every year , and the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers and the Federal Minister for Building Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the country of admission , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Beh@@ bah@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to the throne , there has been a political change : from the ban on employment for refugees to the recognition of work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while earlier there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the residence obligation that limits asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the lack of skilled labour - a majority of the perspective has prevailed that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle to access the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore , according to the view of the throne , the Königs@@ weg for the integration of work .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ mut@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators to rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ olen from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk under@@ estimated that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception hitherto was Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; study willing refugees could facilitate access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ dung do not receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law more if they start studying .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to death .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this gap will be reduced to 15 months .
but also this gap has to be closed , demanding Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play an important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims and for many the religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association which takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this is also part of the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since almost a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U mur@@ ders show , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and interest groups do not require long @-@ term German and why international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention will obli@@ ge Germany must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is in a position to provide healthcare to the hitherto expected refugees , philos@@ opher Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ power and capacity , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requests to hand out health cards immediately to all the newcom@@ ers .
rendered services could later be bil@@ led with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to see so many people with the limited service catalog , which the asylum seek@@ er law prescri@@ bes .
otherwise , the doctors will above all make the language barriers possible .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more poor@@ ly informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
many refugees were also assisted by more general medical centers in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ enligh@@ tenment .
but with the partly other diseases , German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , the refugees might even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have been a highly developed educational system ; some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapist Ret@@ ard@@ ant ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or under depression .
refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , are particularly vulnerable .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee trav@@ eller arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer from among other things the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , cor@@ on@@ ary heart and death sc@@ outs .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , &quot; Mun@@ z declared .
up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , in most cases , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks like rab@@ bits to dream in the arena on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ ader and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current Man@@ e@@ gen@@ st@@ aging .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
so the gift to fan@@ atics lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Jun@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cocktail with a cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
won the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to easily record .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to win women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger tips and joint unity .
balance with the wheel on a ball ?
there is no problem for He y@@ uan .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , how little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , is read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the highest commandment , therefore , is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid @-@ Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks forward to its performances from 17 to 20 September every day from 17th to 20th September .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .

Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe positions fake speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall rapidly spread over social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s call on the call .
in the last month they had borrow@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the State in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for democratic change movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament is ending and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said H@@ HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave to establish electro @-@ equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten your career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal properly .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant sample .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has posted 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league matches in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , having recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a decent time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will set up a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a short break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favorites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has pulled the lesson from last season with the Champions League Cap@@ it@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association to his first European Capital triumph with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked for Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gave us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 @-@ 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at soccer sit in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they are often reluc@@ tant to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of telephone counsel@@ ing it explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ angers has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status about the telephone may help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest on this weekend with the scene completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say Hi .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ but@@ t as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion down , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally got their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a header in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris @-@ Team after his injury , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes appeared , with some short@@ com@@ ings and bad connections , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had left in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria transformed into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post .
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth win of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts on the fact that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an outstanding intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before a substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been detected at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian stated : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hat@@ s off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
en@@ core g@@ athers 2.5 billion $ through share sales
the Gl@@ en@@ core mining @-@ ri@@ ese resident in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling stock as part of its huge debt settlement plan .
the Gl@@ en@@ core company registered in London said in an explanation that it has sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts .
the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights resulted in a rapid increase at the top of London Stock Exchange on trading in early Wednesday morning .
the share rose by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core last week announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to rep@@ ay about a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner of cups , four times champion league winner , twice champion champion , twice champion champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already before the 2008 European Championship before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this also registered FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardian was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds made ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in filming
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown in a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ scored the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian insist@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a hat@@ s beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
the producer of Dear White People set out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger on the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the tweet served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved national impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against colour .
in February Prince Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and control aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which ended its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly ... as I can &apos;t imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , even though he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , it receives the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt just as if they had sw@@ apped the rolls .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
they used to be one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , al@@ beit only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tiger Manager Brad Ab@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings 6 times and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in bul@@ l@@ sh@@ es any game , and therefore I want to go all concentrated into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle himself on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the head@@ board well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ali@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked clearly better out of the bul@@ l@@ ring , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh ring the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bass player Brian Do@@ bler to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer , Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe into a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
after signing a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed ruler , however , st@@ akes S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from an even not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three ranks in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been stri@@ cken before the game by the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month for his back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ hes left a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Nick Castell@@ an@@ os was followed by a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers arrived in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right position .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A. J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired because of a violation of the litter school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder @-@ break@@ age , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is kn@@ itted from the list of injuries to fight against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing since the 20th of August due to a guess in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be defeated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden si@@ ghted on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared in recent days for this eventu@@ ality .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived in H@@ esse , according to the governing pres@@ idency of the government .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive thinking on military action options cannot take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he designed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective displacement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany also sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of an agreement to which Germany could pick up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their aim is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann filed a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers plan to adopt a new incentive for the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of the people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel at the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister of the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would get it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a pencil view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia during the night to Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be sealed off with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ g from seeking ev@@ asive action across Romania , &quot; said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness accounts , thousands of further immigrants came to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
there is a global ocean under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon d@@ angles easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
although this motion is only small , but still too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said to be a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already known that there was liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , which sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed back then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean has not been clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month .
an investigation showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor &apos;s injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old divided the association .
R@@ ama compl@@ ained of pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Leu@@ ven , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to have four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a rob@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the 1960s initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ability to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
goal Hunter Ru@@ bin O@@ ko@@ tie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player should enter the running training .
O@@ ko@@ tie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h at the head .
but , contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious bl@@ ur .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his lean line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - above all su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them are B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Pri@@ marily , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor Beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone does not indicate how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go gives also hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service UPS adds up to 9@@ 5,000 aid to the US Christmas business .
the company already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , announced UPS on Tuesday .

last year , UPS has already raised its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , late deliveries had made the parcel services harsh criticism .
first fo@@ eh@@ ement tower , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night the F@@ öhn winds its way through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and night on Thursday the blow @-@ dryer blows partially with am@@ bush @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ le valleys .
after fo@@ eh@@ ement on Thursday morning , a distinctive cold front crosses us , which brings strong ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a vigor@@ ous southwest currents .
on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night to Wednesday .
as a result , the f@@ öhn blows in the fo@@ eh@@ ills with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance to the adjacent centre and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the slope of the Alps .
here rain starts , which stops until Thursday evening .
in total , south of the Alps , over the next 48 hours , some 100 liters of rain per square meter have to be reck@@ oned , this , after heavy rainf@@ all has fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the f@@ öhn blows out , in the episode a cold front rolls with powerful , partially swe@@ ating rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind pi@@ cks up strongly until stor@@ my weather and the temperatures go back clearly .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , while in the south it is sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Prime Minister Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto un@@ nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now recognized as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the City of Pop@@ es could often live only in seclu@@ sion for centuries as a minority .
with the square , it is symbo@@ lically visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) regarded himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a comm@@ anding cup of sin .
his negative impressions , according to histori@@ ans , might have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the spl@@ itting of the Western Church with his theses about aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gold @-@ plated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated in 150 pictures his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all Books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles dedicated to topics such as cross paths , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ ours .
he immediately fascinated many partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and translated into current context into today &apos;s context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of old painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows dou@@ bly a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Orden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education took place already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up , perhaps to bring me back to the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to re@@ focus on art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is marked by advertisement today and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; slide into the images , &quot; let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost agreed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , even mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was not a cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction start for BM@@ X railway approaches
plans made , place found , companies contracted , Erd@@ hü@@ gel model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was already finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused confusion , especially among residents who would not tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was received in October , the first municipal coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its assistance in tackl@@ ing the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone , to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the law office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would help .
but the crucial course must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; declared Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs have a clear sign when they will be wearing the stamp &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ president Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler said in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can make soccer matches , no , we have to use our power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent division of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the Association together with the DF@@ B ( DF@@ B ) and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already rec@@ alled the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye with a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then drag@@ ged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pl@@ att@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I spent all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again if you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren Sp@@ are pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen in addition to fighting ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched an appropriate photograph and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he is therefore just as little as reserve @-@ keeper for the two common @-@ driver Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
table soccer : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen again , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change to the foo@@ th@@ guard position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of home keeper Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football instructor praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europa League games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left it open .
with a high probability , he will contest the second game as well .
the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal is understandable by Mittel@@ feld@@ player Julian W@@ eig@@ l : &quot; with this Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the automobile .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , intends to invest in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 states , who are also coming together with industry representatives at the IAA .
among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid rise to digital radio .
in order to test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks to be born , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the A@@ AA on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not reck@@ on at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surv@@ eyed say 33 per cent of respon@@ dents with autonomous driving cars in the United States .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give the control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current status of the title campaigns , the Düsseldorf @-@ Düsseldorf will only be hit in sing@@ les from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision is to be made on September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the coach trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European apprentices@@ hip in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship appointment in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European leader Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo too was missing and we became European leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the world rank fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was hit by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis was pointed out by the 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow player from Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ steiger .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure cabinet : designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins which look horri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the designer has changed his initially rejected attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort has been carried out : to fr@@ at@@ inate the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged .
according to the cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers incar@@ n@@ ated 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tim@@ id fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them but of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewels instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as a fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in a large quantity for customers , who , for example , worked on blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Bosch gran@@ aries .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ dry tip , fashion played a major role , was then sup@@ planted by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing job potential .
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
fashion j@@ okes P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they can carry the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the mass commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold over chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date in Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this creates a gap between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design will often only be slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historical snow@@ ball tip .
in doing so , the machine sn@@ akes small spheres at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ vil@@ in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still dar@@ ing a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not a new movie , but a kind of continuation , which plays with the magical child girl 20 years after the first film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family during the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director has already said : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to expand out@@ wards to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leadership Group has adopted a set of directives , including a negative list regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is drawn up which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a legally state business environment and open the market open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to ensure their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double its mercury level in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the levels of mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to exploit the consumer with a much higher dose of the neur@@ on .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish for &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , big pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in turn , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low that they are already keeping the planned high levels already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering at Kl@@ einf@@ elden is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de defl@@ ection manoeu@@ vre which only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal , highly toxic to humans , which greatly enrich the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ or fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts of particularly in infants can cause damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants launched more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance , in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube had been &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; had cited the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March from the paper .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
