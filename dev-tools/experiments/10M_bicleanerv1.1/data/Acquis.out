reasonable samples of all reported reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory to store up to some probability that the Char@@ ge cannot be used anymore .
the reag@@ ents of the reag@@ ent used reag@@ ents can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these are the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools to rein@@ forcement of the effectiveness and the stability of the Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective approach in three groups .
this means that the reag@@ ent human origins contain only substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents are not included in the substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black printed label in English and French language to fix the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating on object carriers also homogen@@ ous red blood cells that are melted in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change if the international standard prepar@@ es are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or several persons who are immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells , which contain an@@ tigen D , but not containing human red blood cells that do not contain an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .

it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding human blood cells that contain an@@ tigen C , but not containing human red blood cells , which do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore specifically designed for the C an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells were shot up in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent boiling sal@@ ine solution .
the tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells .

anti @-@ E Serum is obtained from the blood of one or several persons who are immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object beams in accordance with Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must be mixed with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent sw@@ elling of C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells at about 40 Â° C , must be completed within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of the speci@@ fic@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the speci@@ fic@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ e can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised people or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a specified serum , both antibodies must be effective among the specified response conditions at the same time .
if the serum is intended to use object beams in accordance with Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ance of all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ eil@@ igen antibodies .
anti @-@ A Serum is won out of the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A Serum is inated human red blood cells , the A an@@ tigen , that means those of blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; it is not a human red blood body containing no A an@@ tigen , that means that the blood groups is 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepared by anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or an appropriate comparison , separated from A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .

anti @-@ B Serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the B an@@ tigen , that means those of blood groups B and AB ; there is no human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , that means that the blood groups is 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ sol@@ uble , but un@@ diluted International standard prepared by the Anti @-@ B Blood group or an appropriate comparison , with a floo@@ ding of blood cells in group B .
if Anti @-@ B Serum is mixed on an object gir@@ der with a same amount of 5 to 10@@ percent , the ag@@ glut@@ ination within the double period must occur if the same attempt was done with the re@@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepared by the anti @-@ B blood @-@ group treatment or with a standard pre@@ valent similar avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum to use in blood @-@ group immun@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against supplem@@ enting factors .

an anti @-@ A Re@@ ag@@ ence on a slides with a same amount of 5 to 10 % is mixed up in the same time , the ag@@ glut@@ ination of any fra@@ ction within the double period shall be necessary , but un@@ diluted international standard prepared by anti @-@ A blood @-@ group treatment or with a standard pre@@ valent similar avi@@ dity , ( vegetable ) .
anti @-@ B reag@@ ent is won by extrac@@ ting from the appropriate part of a suitable plant and , if subsequent cleaning .
the Anti @-@ B Re@@ ag@@ ence ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that means Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogenic B does not contain those of blood groups B and AB ; there is no human red blood cells that contain no Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen B , that means that of blood groups 0 and A .
the anti @-@ B reag@@ ent is mixed on a slide panel with a same amount of 5 to 10 % reduction of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination within the double period must occur if the same attempt was done with the un@@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepared by the anti @-@ B blood @-@ group treatment or a standard pre@@ valent similar avi@@ dity .
