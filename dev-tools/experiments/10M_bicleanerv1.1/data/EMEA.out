this document is a summary of the European public proc@@ urement report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained in the studies as the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , which is conducted by the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to achieve recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
if you require further information on your disease or treatment , please read the Pack@@ et service ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or turn to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish any further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets which dissolve itself in the mouth ) as a solution to insert ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection of injection ( 7,5 mg / ml ) .
B . effective thinking and speaking , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening , listening to sight , which are not present ) , mis@@ ery and mad@@ ness ; • bi@@ polar I inter@@ ruption , a psychological disease , with the patient lack of periods ( Peri@@ ods of abnormal high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe episodes and pre@@ vent@@ ative episodes for patients who have addressed in the past in the past .
the injection solution is applied for fast control of distur@@ b@@ ying un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles if the oral consumption of medication is not possible .
in both cases the solution can take the solution for inser@@ ting or the melting tablets in patients , which is preparing the swal@@ low of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are using other medicines at the same time , the dose of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of ner@@ ve cells among themselves .
Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol appears primarily as &quot; partial ag@@ onist for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and D@@ op@@ amine , but in less dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter acts to enable the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ulation to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , resulting psych@@ otic or lack of symptoms and their re@@ acting is avoided .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy to prevent symptoms of symptoms were examined in three studies over up to one year .
the efficacy of inj@@ ectors solution was examined in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases caused by a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy was compared with twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy and placebo which have been stabil@@ ized to 160 patients , with which the man@@ ian symptoms were already stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy In@@ jection solution was examined in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , who suffered severe un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients was investigated by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also led studies to investigate , such as the body uses the melting tray and the solution to insert them ( decreases ) .
in both studies with the injection of injection solutions , the A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms compared to those who received placebo .
the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder was reduced to four of the five short @-@ time studies in four of the five short @-@ time studies .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks for more effective than placebo the re @-@ performing episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered additionally to an existing treatment .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also been effective as placebo the symptoms stri@@ pped and were similar effective like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ id@@ al interference ( un@@ controlled ) , enz@@ ym@@ es , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea production ) , ti@@ el@@ hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased spoke production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion ( increased storage production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness , In@@ som@@ nia , In@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxi@@ ety .
at the conclusion of the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and from mid @-@ heavy @-@ severe episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption as well as the prevention of a new poor episode in patients who had mainly lack of episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole treatment , compared to risks associated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the committee on the result was that the advantages of inj@@ ections in the fast control of distur@@ b@@ ous trou@@ bles and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with lack of episodes of bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ulation , if a oral therapy is not suitable for risks associated with risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . an authorization for the entry of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is intended for the treatment of standard to severe episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly lack of episodes and their lack of episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with respect to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justified ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icides diseases belongs to psychological disorders and aff@@ ecting psych@@ otic diseases and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an anti@@ bi@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance caused an increased su@@ prem@@ acy risk with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol should be treated with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduction ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less continued , there has been occas@@ i@@ onal reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms that has grown to a m@@ ns , or clear a fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y must be removed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ um cases in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with states that will be applied to be used with cl@@ amp@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol , an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for un@@ wanted vas@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ ene tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em or death was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ bi@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents of patients treated directly .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to com@@ od@@ dities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , with which weight gain is known as secondary effects and could lead to severe complic@@ ations .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol on the central nerv@@ ous system is careful if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alised medication such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar dos@@ ages .
for CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol . compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive met@@ abolic agents .
if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit of potential health benefits for patients .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ants , do similar effects have and therefore ought to be made similar dos@@ ages .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered with an increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentration .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ology ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
people should be able to draw their doctor , if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ adequate data base for safety in humans and due to the re@@ productive studies in the animal , this drug may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the possible value is justified by the potential risk for the red@@ us .
but as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , patients should be war@@ ned , hazardous machines , including power vehicles , including power vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole has no negative effect .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) :
the frequency of the side listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was found in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ ol@@ an therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was observed in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo there were significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , which resulted in any medical significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , general temporary and physi@@ pt@@ om@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
regarding the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality in elderly de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate super@@ v@@ ings were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence .
in fact , no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis case in the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; it is un@@ likely that hem@@ or@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dosage of benefits since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma cutting .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I inter@@ rupt has been medi@@ ated by combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - und 5@@ HT@@ 7 , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gen and for Hist@@ amin @-@ H1@@ receptor .
during the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily , a dos@@ ages reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor coding , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the Put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a Sem@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the response of the patients who are talking to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measuring sc@@ als defined as secondary programmes included , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ ress@@ rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ der in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients showed a weight increase of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ists with a flexible or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I inter@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over placebo over three weeks in reducing symptoms .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ist study of 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I inter@@ rupt , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no over@@ coming efficacy .
in two Plac@@ ement@@ - and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ical or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed over placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a warming effect that was comparable with lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol also pointed out 12 a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic remission of man@@ y on such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ical or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I distur@@ bed , with or without psych@@ otic activity , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing your symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with Lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ ization phase before Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed that in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar return response , mainly during prevention of a return in Man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies , the enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , which is transmitted by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cataly@@ st .
average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ ale Age is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol during an intensive metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and with almost 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic investigation of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a Pop@@ ulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or the impact of the prey on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different grave liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect as regards the impair@@ ment of the liver function on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics and de@@ hydr@@ ation of liver function , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to withdraw their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ po@@ ology , tox@@ icity , with repeated gift , Re@@ productive @-@ sto@@ icity , com@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to kan@@ oid potential , the pre@@ clinical data could recognize any special haz@@ ards for the people .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of people , so that they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects of the dos@@ ages of non @-@ dependent activation ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ c@@ ine pigment accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ ym@@ ph cell ) in rats at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the average Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose during people ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose during people .
in addition , a cholesterol was determined as a result of the failure of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ gen@@ ic acid in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose when people are based on mg / m2 ) .
however , in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ z@@ ol were not more than 6 % of concentrations that were detected in the G@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ u@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed for dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

for prevention of recur@@ ren@@ al episodes of patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol , the therapy should be continued with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less continued , there has been occas@@ i@@ onal reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ ene tin or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em or death was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ bi@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents of patients treated directly .

Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered with an increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentration .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was reported in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I inter@@ rupt has been medi@@ ated by combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ der in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients showed a weight increase of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ist study of 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I inter@@ rupt , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was compared to a dose of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol in tablet form at healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ thermore , a cholesterol was determined as a result of the failure of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ gen@@ ic acid in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose when people are based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed for dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y In@@ jection solution is applied to fast control of ag@@ iti@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ulation , if a oral therapy is not attached .
once it is applied , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ections should be completed and began with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , a injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eal muscles of ob@@ sol@@ es regions is recommended .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) , depending on individual clinical status , the drug can be used to be used in consideration of the drug or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further chemical treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the characteristics of the drugs to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y hot tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to insert .
there are no investigation on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ections in patients with ag@@ it@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles that caused differently than caused by schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and lack episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with gasoline bl@@ az@@ ep@@ ins in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ections , the patients should be observed as regards to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure . ( see section 4.5 ) .
examinations for safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ections are not prescribed for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical po@@ is@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol should be treated with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduction ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less continued , there has been occas@@ i@@ onal reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing awareness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ y@@ kar@@ ate , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to com@@ od@@ dities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica in which weight gain is known or an un@@ healthy life and could lead to severe complic@@ ations .
nevertheless the intensity of the se@@ per@@ ation greater compared with the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( 15 mg dose ) was applied as a mal@@ icious in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular , and the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically .
with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can result the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ ors , these similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received the intensity of the Sed@@ ation bigger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ections ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials by the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was found in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo there were significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , which resulted in any medical significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , general temporary and physi@@ pt@@ om@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
regarding the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality in elderly de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements of ag@@ iti@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al diseases compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ oral dysfunction , the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ector associated with a statistically significant improvement of symptoms in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed medium improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement Component scores with the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ it@@ eness , a similar efficacy in relation to the total population was observed , but a statistical significance was determined because of a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a Sem@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the response of the patients suffering from response to study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measuring sc@@ als defined as secondary programmes included , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ der in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included a weight increase of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg .
111 In a placebo controlled study over 6 weeks in patients with a man@@ ical or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption , with or without psych@@ otic activity , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing your symptoms compared to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of man@@ ic patients , with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ ization phase before Rand@@ om@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol was superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly during prevention of a return in Man@@ ie .
the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection . 90 % greater the AU@@ C after gift of the same dose as tablet ; the systematic exposition was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level in 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol inj@@ ections was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , resulting in any direct tox@@ icity of a target body after repeated gift at a systematic exposition ( AU@@ C ) , which was administered in 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies for re@@ productive distribution according to intraven@@ ous application , no security concerns after matern@@ al exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) on security har@@ ass@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repe@@ ating gift , Re@@ productive @-@ sto@@ icity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to kan@@ oid potential , the pre@@ clinical data could recognize any special haz@@ ards for the people .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure during people ; thus they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects of recorded a dos@@ si@@ ent tri@@ ni@@ otic tox@@ icity ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the recommended maximum dose during people ) and an increase of an@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ rin@@ den @-@ Aden@@ omes / car@@ cin@@ oma at a recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose during people .
in addition , a cholesterol was determined as a result of the failure of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys to repeated oral @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose when people are based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed for dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , at the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some three quarters of which had been an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in all a gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of the patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug .
considering only the patients who have been treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between the disease and survival in relation to the efficacy of illness and survival .
in contrast to patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with respect to these indicators that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ contained drugs .
it is also not used to be used in people who have been nurs@@ ing or before the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ ins in the blood .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane contained in people where the first treatment was no longer effective , effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drugs , and that it must not be given as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines not to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Ab@@ ra@@ xis Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited an authorization for the placing on the market of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients , with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not shown for standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or serious sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
in sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 the treatment is expected to break up to a degree of degree 1 or 2 , and at all following cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tions in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for in@@ compatibility and effectiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ ulation formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much more pharmac@@ ological features as other for@@ ci@@ ences of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and treated a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment and the patient must not be treated again with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patient , no further ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be guided back to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
during a clear with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in connection to the car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac ab@@ normal@@ ities are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ gens and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ic funds .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in common age , not as an effective conception , not effective , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unbe@@ atable .
women in common age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane a reliable reduction method .
male patients who are treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is enrich@@ ed , while and up to six months after treatment there is no child .
male patients should be advised from treatment over a sperm enhancement , since the treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane can cause adverse events such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can work on traffic light and ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important events of side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of patients ) , and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ depends ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects were listed in conjunction with the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy in every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active ingredient that supports the inter@@ locking of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ines by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the erotic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in trans@@ duc@@ ed the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ ma@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies have been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el has been supporting the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ endo@@ thel@@ ial transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ album receptor is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ at@@ al Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( ch@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the area of the tum@@ ors .
the application of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single @-@ un@@ blind studies and from 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III study study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mono@@ therap@@ ist with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour infusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute infusion with relief type ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had an adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % because of metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ line treatment are listed below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity opposite P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 .
the natural course of peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y to the Ab@@ kl@@ ingen to Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of the general @-@ P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute infusion of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the actual exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased to multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide range of ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ cular distribution and / or wheat binding of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 minutes of in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 ad@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 A solvent @-@ free P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the cle@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher than after the Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ based P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and ri@@ pping coating is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is associated with 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ abolic ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ulative ur@@ ine was reduced by less than 1 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ abolic rate and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which shows an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance .

member states must ensure that the holders of approval for the market will be supplied to the market launch of medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drugs ( technical information ) , labelling and packing request . • With unique images of the correct use of the product , cooling boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that wast@@ ew@@ ater is similar to an organic medic@@ inal product that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference value &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , which may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complic@@ ations , if the procedure is not possible , where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected .
treatment with se@@ per@@ ation must be guided under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ bl@@ ender , l@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his advis@@ ors , if they have received an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , or in patients who received chemotherapy should always be observed in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl for children ) .
the iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron gel is made , and iron should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy , or patients with kidney problems , a an@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or that the body is not sufficient for the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that was associated with a gene ( DNA ) that it is authorised for the formation of ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was accounted for injection in a v@@ ein in the frame of a main study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems , compared to the reference value .
all of these patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were either converted to ab@@ amed or still receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the variation of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s between the beginning of the study and the preparation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid the results of a study before , in which the effects were studied under the skin spec@@ kl@@ ed se@@ per@@ ation with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ations of patients were observed , in the same dimensions such as in those patients who continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continue with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common tri@@ bution of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , occasionally to symptoms of endo@@ spongiform encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ew@@ ays mig@@ raine and confusion .
the se@@ per@@ ation may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
abor@@ tion under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the drug has been completed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that covers Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information about medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of drugs .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG approval for the placing on the market of se@@ per@@ ation in the entire European Union .

An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ ym@@ pt@@ omes and fol@@ ks can be different depending on age , gender and total disease last ; therefore , the evaluation of individual clinical development and disease management is necessary due to the doctor .
an increase of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , patients can occasionally be observed with individual hem@@ og@@ onal bin@@ oc@@ ities via or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ism target .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ability should be attemp@@ ting to reach hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ um is rising by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the long @-@ term hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ist@@ rate is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ och@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should ensure close m@@ esh@@ ed to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose that is required to control the an@@ emia and an@@ mi@@ ym@@ pt@@ omes .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher maintenance boxes than patients , where the initial an@@ emia is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .

in tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine response should be considered ( patients who may be trans@@ f@@ ited ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be minim@@ ized to minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic occurr@@ ence ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ist with the goal to keep the hem@@ og@@ urt value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in participation of the respective patients who should take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , prior to the beginning of the ep@@ och@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who under@@ go a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should have an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis because they have an increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly with a low @-@ level cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it may not be excluded for patients with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting point reduction of &gt; 13 g / dl provides an increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events .
in several controlled studies , it is not proven that they could improve the overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia .

there is an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are treated on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in in tumour patients who were treated with chemotherapy , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones w@@ asted ) both for women under the exchange years as well as in men .
it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone mar@@ es ) , including those who have suffered a sad hat@@ ch@@ ment as in the inf@@ ectious disease ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get &apos;s bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus passport should be taken at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with stro@@ kes should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) by inj@@ ections in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms in the three days after in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , has been part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a to review by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis was involved , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had suffered a stro@@ ve structure ; it was investigated by the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , the bone sub@@ distance ) decreased to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ ra@@ ids in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to placebo was reduced by 70 % .
compared to all patients in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under placebo the risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with ke@@ epers , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a questionnaire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients receiving placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusion .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ata or one of the other ingredients .
as in all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions at Inf@@ usi@@ ons@@ lau@@ de and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors ready to use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , such as the drug should be used , as well as similar material for patients , where the side effects of the drugs should be explained and insi@@ sted when they should contact the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended every year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes , the administration of the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended by two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip . ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was observed a long di@@ emis@@ si@@ onal period in patients who have been addressed to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , according to at least 500 mg elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently replaced low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. orange or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion .
the prevalence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney disease ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adap@@ tion is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , because data for in@@ fertil@@ ity and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for this patient &apos;s population is limited to limited clinical experience .
an existing hypo@@ cal@@ z@@ emia is prior to the onset of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a due to sufficient amount of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the quick impact of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , among the sympt@@ om@@ atic mort@@ ars , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , according to at least 500 mg elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ on@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be replaced before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dent@@ al@@ ous tooth treatment .
for patients who require dental reefs , no data are available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduced the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the pine area .
clinical evaluation by the treatment doctor should be the basis of any patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the prevalence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced after the application of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the prevalence of adverse events reported by pre @-@ hop@@ el@@ ations in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 852 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ian Fra@@ cture trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was comparable to the overall risk of alleg@@ ations between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ desirable medicines are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with kidney dysfunction , which caused a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as a acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance ( measured by the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo treated patients .
based on the assessment of the laboratory work , the temporary symbol of pt@@ om@@ atic calcium values determined at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amount of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a stro@@ kes and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a recent transition , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to infusion , sw@@ elling , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area were cas@@ ually added , especially with cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had evidence of local infections including oste@@ opath@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients on cancer patients or other dental ages .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in a jaw area with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and treated with placebo treated patients .
in case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clinical @-@ relevant hypo@@ cal@@ z@@ emia can be achieved through gift from orange calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once per year was performed in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) for 3 consecutive years , with either a bone structure ( BM@@ D ) , or at least two light or a medium @-@ heavy verteb@@ rates or a BM@@ D score for the co@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ one .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ rates A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new sp@@ ine ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients aged 75 years and older had reduced by 60 % reduced risk for cycl@@ ine cells compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
impact on hip fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed consistently lead over three years , which resulted in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for stro@@ kes .
impact on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the l@@ um@@ bar acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with the placebo treatment significantly to all periods ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the l@@ um@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the total th@@ igh rise by 6.0 % , the scra@@ per around 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
Kno@@ ch@@ enh@@ ist@@ ology showed 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the Beck@@ um .
a Micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic - ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and receiving the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture in comparison to placebo .
bone mar@@ vel@@ ous phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 517 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of time period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
impact on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total th@@ aw@@ less and scra@@ pers at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the overall balance and by 4.3 % on the ground .
clinical efficacy in men in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study were random@@ ized to 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged for 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study by men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage change of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at to the percentage of the l@@ um@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of Kno@@ ck A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2,@@ 6@@ times to 3,@@ 0@@ fold @-@ specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ac@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was documented in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as a Respon@@ sible study at the end of the six @-@ month trial , were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron patients treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic concerns of 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , with a medium duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
inf@@ usi@@ ons of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid with 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that appeared as dos@@ si@@ cally .
after that the plasma tor@@ es increased rapidly at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
R@@ asch@@ es bi@@ phase dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a terminal elim@@ ination time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) will probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and the differentiation of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in ur@@ ine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone fabric .
the total @-@ body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race , or body weight .
an extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration camps ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systeme is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in humans , because it is a weak or not a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , replac@@ eable inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ac@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function until a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adaptation of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European public proc@@ urement report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained in the studies as the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , which is conducted by the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to achieve recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is applied to treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( in particular patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ ic medicine ) is not displayed . • It can be used together with another diabet@@ ic medicine .
in addition , met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) can be applied to patients with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ate resin or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ fuel or ins@@ ulin can be retained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar level ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sulph@@ ate resin or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be used better and the blood sugar level can be reduced better , resulting in type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ tos was investigated in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ate resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows to close the blood sugar values for doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ ware demonstrated in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin is examined in 289 patients , patients who enrolled Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin was compared with 0.14 % after 6 months compared to 0.14 % compared to placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision@@ disorders , infections of the upper respiratory symptoms ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ a@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos may neither be used in patients ( allerg@@ y ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or diabet@@ ic vinegar ( high ket@@ ones level - acid@@ spar - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mono@@ therap@@ ist ( in general use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients should be shown at which Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for the integration of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white up to white , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate , and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application will not be recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or Ö@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and Ö@@ de@@ me , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease .
this study showed an increase in reports on cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , which led to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal area ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardis@@ ation area , the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers are as soon as possible as possible .
if one patient developed symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , ti@@ red@@ ness , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n are the liver enz@@ ym@@ es .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should continue until the presentation of the laboratory parameters should be guided by the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ si@@ ent weight increase was detected , stir from fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a liquid assets .
as a result of a hem@@ at@@ l@@ ution occurred among the therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ulation ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ urt bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity in patients , the pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one can be used as or@@ ally two or triple combination therapy with a sulph@@ ur@@ ine har@@ lot or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
after the launch of Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ an treatment , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear if there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular de@@ bit , the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a should be aware of patients over distur@@ b@@ ation of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic declaration should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events concerning bone mar@@ ries from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated questionnaire was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years , treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wish to be a pregnancy , or the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for examination of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on do not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phenol and met@@ form@@ in .
interaction with drugs which are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enz@@ ym@@ es , e.g. oral contra@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium blo@@ cker , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ ers are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in order to increase the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the result of treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one who di@@ min@@ ished hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of matern@@ ity and thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the acute growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( derived from this data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the formation of the lens , as they are also observed in other h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ st@@ iege appeared on three times the upper limit of the standard area as often as in placebo but more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ ate resin .
in an out@@ come trial in patients with previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rarely over cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency is reported among Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was applied in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure .
a summary analysis of messages prohib@@ its events concerning bone mar@@ ries from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with groups of treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients .
in over a period of 3.5 years of running Pro@@ active study , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a reference medication .
during taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to work on a activation @-@ specific nuclear acceptance ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver - , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glu@@ cos@@ ine appreci@@ ation in case of ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant .
a clinical study conducted with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the period until post@@ ure of therapeutic effectiveness ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be invo@@ iced by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was discontinued despite three @-@ month optim@@ isation phase with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared with the patients who continue to receive only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin @-@ do@@ omed was observed in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one group .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statistically significant decrease of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ans were compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , based on type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase of the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol and slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ ca@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo there was no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol while using Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was not only the so@@ ber tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved the tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this also improved to tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come trial , included 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previously untreated advanced vas@@ cular disease in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular therapy either by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one will be res@@ or@@ ded quickly , whereby the top concentration of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one can be achieved in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV requires the effectiveness in about three times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ one , while the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal pronounced .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phenol and met@@ form@@ in .

according to oral application of radio@@ actively mark@@ eted Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the case ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the median plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ allow time of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active met@@ abolic rate is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower than in healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function , but the rates of the oral cle@@ ance of the mother is similar .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was tested in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use the ins@@ ulin @-@ effective .
after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ eg@@ els that the blood sugar levels were similar strongly as with another human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who probably react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other ingredients .
in addition , doses have to be adapted from Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can work on the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in case of packing ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane weigh over risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the placing on the market of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a quick initi@@ alized effect can be w@@ ished with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the total dose is inj@@ ected .

if the ur@@ inary acidity is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months , still tox@@ ins appear ; therefore , patients are recommended to take the patient at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even more medicines for prevention of plaster attacks .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had transplan@@ t transplan@@ t for these groups .
in the first study , participated in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( a placebo group ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a other drugs for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid in the blood was below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg revenues , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily had 120 mg total ur@@ inary tract in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients were under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea and abnormal liver values .
in particular , in patients with heart attacks in pre@@ history , a increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
at the end , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of the ur@@ inary blood vessels in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of adverse reactions in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

the lowering of the serum levels at &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed at the physician attendance in week 2 and permanently kept throughout the whole treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .

with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of distur@@ ban@@ anas in subjects , despite their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act trial ) had to study a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ al concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years collected data from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients showed a decrease of tox@@ ins in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ ull @-@ stroke ) .
this was associated with a reduction of gyp@@ sum size , which was 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of plaster no@@ des by month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) , and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long@@ time extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to administration easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase of AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ propor@@ tion@@ able increase .
after taking a sim@@ pler or multiple doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 times a day , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum levels , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ s@@ s / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l , depending of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma cutting of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration width which is achieved with cans of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in vitro studies of human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes showed that these oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites are formed primarily by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ ric cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

in addition to the differentiation of the ur@@ ine , approximately 45 % of the dose found in the chair as an un@@ changeable Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 25 % ) , as well as other un@@ known metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure - After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at does not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the middle total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by about the 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe genetic function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ met@@ abolic and ur@@ ine composition and are not relevant for clinical use as a result .
it was found that Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not have any effect on the fertil@@ ity and reproduction power of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , in which the bones are brow@@ ned ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a low vitamin D mirror exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or intake of other drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the feeding tube , the patient must not take up until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should be done at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D spi@@ der .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at revenue ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dosage is exactly the dose that is required for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of motion apparatus ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of digest@@ ive device such as abdom@@ inal pain , g@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , ul@@ cers , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( Schl@@ u@@ ck@@ h ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( b@@ agu@@ ed stomach ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en .
in patients with any sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be used in cases of eating oils in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients who can not stand upright in at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplement ) for the day .
the following references are exactly to be observed , to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and to reduce side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be loaded after the start of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which should be carried out at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms , which should be noted on possible mal@@ op@@ ic reactions , and the patients should be noted , in the occurr@@ ence of symptoms such as dy@@ ak@@ ag@@ ie , pain during sl@@ ud@@ ge or retro@@ sp@@ inal pain or new or wor@@ shipping the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) .

the clinical assessment caused by the treatment doctor is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients should be instructed to take advantage of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet to the next morning after they have noticed their trans@@ gression .
you should take no two tablets on the same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases caused the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and h@@ yp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should be treated before the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and several or@@ ale medicines may affect the or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , if they are taken at the same time .
therefore the patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at least 30 minutes before using other drugs ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific Inter@@ action studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a multitude of usually prescribed drugs , without knowing clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither during pregnancy nor of l@@ act@@ ating women .

furthermore , the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , and the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
main Indi@@ cator of the effectiveness was the number of patients who were transplan@@ ted after a period of treatment duration of one year ( as often as often a new organ transplan@@ t or re @-@ absorption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more recent studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined , as Adv@@ agra@@ f was included in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

only doctors who tru@@ sts in immun@@ ity @-@ intensive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ ts should make this medicine de@@ classified or changes in the immune treatment therapy .
due to clinical relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immune .
patients always should always preserve the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage may only be kept under the nar@@ rati@@ onal control of one in the transplan@@ tation of experienced medicine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systematic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will remain .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based on the clinical assessment of out@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in detail and on blood @-@ level rules ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; )
after change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f you should control the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion will be controlled .
in day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure measured as a valley mirror , with both for@@ ums both near ren@@ al and transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate ref@@ res@@ ur@@ ation phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , a adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .

duration of the suppression of the transplan@@ tation camp must be maintained immun@@ otherapy ; a maximum period of oral therapy can therefore not be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning .
further dose custom@@ iz@@ ations can be later necessary since the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ization of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning .
dosage recommendation - transition from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to one once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this conversion has to be made in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pi@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f a day must begin the treatment with the recommended initial initi@@ als recommended for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to a agra@@ f an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day should be taken once daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t receivers does not exist any clinical experience with pneum@@ onia , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ fied patients in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , in a oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in case transplan@@ ted dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day to use .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining bl@@ utt@@ ons reflected in patients with severe liver function , a reduction of the dose may be required .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dose adap@@ tion is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum level insp@@ iegel , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ to to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the transition from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is necessary ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood The dose should be based on the clinical assessment of har@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in the case of int@@ ru@@ ction of full blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us insp@@ ections .
it is recommended frequent insp@@ ections of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ valley mirror by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be monitored according to the transition from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose custom@@ ization , changes to immune soup @-@ intensive therapy or any use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , you can custom@@ ize the dose for several days until the Ste@@ ady State occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the bottom level was not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and transplan@@ t patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent creation of liver and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation , blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft reactions or other side effects , which can occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients always should always preserve the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage may only be kept under the nar@@ rati@@ onal control of one in the transplan@@ tation of experienced medicine ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which proved to be treated with other immun@@ om@@ od@@ dities , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of a agra@@ f .
for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions in adult heart transplan@@ t and gra@@ fts in the childhood are not yet a clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation advanced in advance .
because of possible inter@@ actions which lead to a down@@ grade of tac@@ ar@@ lim@@ us in blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of plant extracts ( hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rate ) is containing or other plants during treatment with a agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood is commanded , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level can be subjected to such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a group of kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y was observed chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ t@@ roph@@ y , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ on@@ ero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ loading and oil .
as in other immune soup , the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ igner skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection factor with a high protection factor .
if patients suffering from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of P@@ res such as head@@ aches , change consciousness , condition , forces and visual disorders should show a radical examination ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous use of medicines or plant medic@@ ations that are known as inhibit@@ or or induction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can alter the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , therefore reduce blood values from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore advis@@ able to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood level with the benefit of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

treatment transplan@@ tation In an intermediate analysis via a recently , multi @-@ cent@@ ric trial with or@@ gas@@ Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported on 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
a chronic transplan@@ tation , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis obl@@ iter@@ acy &apos;s syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ tation ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) .
survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ climate and 83 % in Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , there came in 2@@ 1.7 % of the cases of emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % below Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases who had to be converted into Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly higher ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to Cic@@ los@@ por@@ n ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there came to no acute transplan@@ tation was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) , the median reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group is bigger ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study the incidence of emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis @-@ iter@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly less in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ al transplan@@ tation A multi@@ cent@@ ric study conducted at 205 patients who received a pan@@ cre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ tation , received a random@@ ized process of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ n ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al dose ( per protocol ) from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us amounted to 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reaching the target fe@@ at from 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
intest@@ inal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ cent@@ ric study showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ inal , 75 liver and intest@@ inal transplan@@ tation ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one a update survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ miss@@ ile fra@@ ction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or through treatment with cor@@ onation ost@@ ero@@ ids , the ampli@@ fication of the metabolism should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance R@@ ates .
this allows that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will be met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in front of the differentiation , with the differentiation mainly via the g@@ all .
in a stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended frequent insp@@ ections of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII below , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ utch ) .
the dosage and frequency of application must be addressed to treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes bleeding problems in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but after a method produced as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that has been associated with a gene ( DNA ) that it is authorised to formation of the human od@@ inn@@ ate factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different drug in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but will be produced differently , so the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of medicines were investigated for prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; evaluated .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against the human od@@ inn@@ itus factor VIII , m@@ aus@@ - or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval a approval for the placing on the market of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage intake and duration of the sub@@ stitution is addressed after the sever@@ ity of factor VIII , after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical status of patients .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are solved .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of patients is passed .
during treatment , the dose is enrich@@ ed to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma glucose levels .
individual patients can distingu@@ ish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and different half times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for a long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of blood in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ c cannot be achieved or if the blood pressure is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to verify an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be done .
the administration speed should be addressed after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ codi@@ atory activity of factor VIII directional Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine that are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , which depends on the risk of genetic and other factors within the first 20 minutes of exposure .
in the treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure times and an am@@ ne@@ stic @-@ known inhibit@@ or development was observed , after the change@@ over by a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product , it was observed ( lower tit@@ re ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare event of hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women , there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all treated with previously untreated patients who have increased risk of inhibit@@ ors ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculations ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE In@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ining of blood was calculated during the whole time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the cle@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post of the postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE at 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic severe severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only a patient after 26 exposure periods with A@@ DV@@ ATE has a low in@@ inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in adjusted Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .

in previously untreated patients of a current clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients In@@ hibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on trac@@ t@@ amine proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against this proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as a continued peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell cultures , otherwise there were no signs of signs or symptoms shown on an allergic reaction or an over@@ sensitivity .

based on the initial approval of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has continued the benefit @-@ risk sub@@ sid@@ y to be positive as positive , but into account that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
as a result the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of safety requirements of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is required to achieve a single submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , that the authorisation is intended to apply for another extension of authorisation in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited on the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially declared that the company intends to withdraw his application for the entry of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the white parts ( t@@ issues , connecting other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and support ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus which has been genet@@ ically modified that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which was so changed , that there is no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections can trigger in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and enable the cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body of the p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and killing cells when DNA cannot be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells may grow and share .
the company applied data from a study with a patient before , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of under@@ mining , in the bones and the brain .
after CH@@ MP grants the answers to the questions which had been reviewed , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the testing of the initially submitted documents , CH@@ MP is provided on Day 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company .
after the CH@@ MP , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in was not enough that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors are advantages for patients .
the Committee had further concerns relating to the processing of drugs in the body , the type of administration and safety of drugs .
in addition , the company had not suff@@ ici@@ ently proven that advanced in a reliable way , and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in en@@ su@@ ally contact with the patient .
the company put the CH@@ MP not aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changing force release &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the most effective components is immediately released and the other slowly gets released over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( Gras@@ shop@@ pers , caused by an allerg@@ y against poll@@ en , inflamm@@ ation of the nostr@@ ils ) in patients with Nas@@ en@@ mu@@ cos@@ a sw@@ elling ( clo@@ g@@ ged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents over 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is one tablet that should be taken up with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and end , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a ( bund@@ les nose ) , are dis@@ kl@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the most effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the Heu@@ v@@ up@@ un@@ ens@@ pt@@ omes , which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the loc@@ ust@@ s of the nose , the patients , the aer@@ op@@ aze revenue , the aer@@ in@@ aze revenue , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % compared to 3@@ 5.9 % compared to the patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
when only the sw@@ elling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients below Aer@@ ine aze a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % of patients who were des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common adverse events of aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ vity ) , con@@ sti@@ ve , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( battles ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ aze may be used in patients suffering from allergic ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components , against ad@@ r@@ ener@@ ge active substances or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different medicines for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may also be used in patients suffering from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( over@@ function of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have a h@@ ort@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic strike ( caused by a brain blood circulation ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic impact .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval a approval for the entry of aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it is the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without breaking down or cut down ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since for long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with the time may take off .
after decline in the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ ation , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , the drug is also contra@@ cted in patients who will be treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ et@@ ical activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors , such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ d , Lis@@ ur@@ olin , ot@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other dec@@ on@@ ization , phen@@ yl car@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rin , Oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient @-@ refle@@ cting and the data is not sufficient to make appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is not sufficient to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage .
the patients must be informed that treatment in the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ y@@ ton@@ or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or et@@ ch@@ ai@@ ve other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( like head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of the head@@ aches ) .
in the treatment of the following patients : • Pati@@ ents under D@@ IG@@ IT@@ AL@@ IS • patients with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • patients with a my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ in@@ aze is used at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since Anti@@ hist@@ amine can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction or reduce their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given in addition , no clinical relevant inter@@ actions or changes of plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ orn were observed .
in case of the results of the psych@@ ologist tests , no significant differences were detected between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and treated with placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ley was taken alone or with alcohol .
this was not identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ fertil@@ ity of aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since realis@@ ing studies on animals not always be transferred to humans and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ sens@@ ory characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be applied in the pregnancy .
however , the patients should however be resolved that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a c@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ed spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , Con@@ vul@@ tures ) with possible let@@ tering .
head@@ aches , anxi@@ ety , dis@@ rup@@ tions , mus@@ cular suff@@ iciency , cardi@@ ac disease , thirst , im@@ perme@@ ability , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , relief , preventive pain , di@@ zz@@ y , ten@@ ants and hyper@@ tension or h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony .
a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation is especially likely to children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( oral @-@ dried , pl@@ u@@ ill@@ ary and di@@ lem@@ at@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the expression of the expression of the hem@@ oph@@ en@@ ül@@ s P sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in an individual dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring sizes of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective battles or the tasks that are connected with the fly .
in controlled clinical studies , in case of recommended dosage of 5 mg daily , no increased incidence of battles in comparison to placebo was detected .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage may cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ et@@ ric effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS detection .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergi@@ en@@ ic r@@ hin@@ itis , whereby 414 patients Aer@@ op@@ aze tablets have received .
in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin via the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
during a single @-@ dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is veri@@ fi@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached on Day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic multi@@ disciplinary study , which was carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ley was bad@@ ly rep@@ utable .
a components of interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ sigh@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin after the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent was the exposure to an aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ ology , for tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , does not recognize any special haz@@ ards for men .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the effects found in general related to the syn@@ op@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
there were further studies submitted to prove that the body makes the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application for children un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
with allergic Rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of symptoms of symptoms by 25 to 32 % , compared to a decrease from 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval a approval for the entry of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for the reduction of symptoms in allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should termin@@ ate according to the previous disease and can be resum@@ ed and resum@@ ed with their resum@@ ing .
in persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allerg@@ y period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected during clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in@@ clin@@ ically in@@ gest@@ ion and alcohol is not strengthened the most efficient effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should however be resolved that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic Rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients who were treated with placebo .
most common adverse events , more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , oral @-@ dri@@ es ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect was treated with 5.9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and were treated with 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose trial , at which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of the P sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statistically significant or clinical @-@ relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
with a single dos@@ si@@ - study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring sizes of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective battles or the tasks that are connected with the fly .
in patients with allergic Rhin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective at the reduction of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ cap@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , it@@ ching and ro@@ cking of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis in dependence of symptoms can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis .
Inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us reduces effectively that caused by seasonal allergi@@ en@@ ic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology associated with various forms is similar and chronic patients can be recruited .
since the hist@@ amine release is expected a key factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ox is also reflected in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective at the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the size of t@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ amine , chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was the minority of patients who did not respond to Anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ ika , from the study .
improvement of the jewel@@ s by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo treated patients .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and the guard , as was measured by a 4 @-@ point @-@ scale to evaluate this variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis -@@ population , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no reference points for a clinical @-@ relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ley , however , was not identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs will not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo , not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ sier with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fat @-@ rich , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical trials performed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin performed pre@@ clinical trials , at a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the tox@@ ic@@ ity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and by Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies for safety @-@ har@@ ology , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine did not recognize any special haz@@ ards for men .

A@@ eri@@ us may be taken independently of meals to the reduction of symptoms in allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the open doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are required to support the treatment of a inf@@ ectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory diseases or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical investigations , and corresponding laboratory and skin investigation should play a roll .
for about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ mir@@ ation is restricted and experienced a higher substr@@ ate burden ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is restricted to restri@@ ctive , is identical to the children that met@@ abolic syndrome .
this medic@@ inal product contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or a suc@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ an in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , util@@ ising A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not strengthened the most efficient effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total hardness of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic Rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose trial in adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
children between 1 and 11 years old , who came to a anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily disin@@ teg@@ ration dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic Rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ings are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statistically significant or clinical @-@ relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied to a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
in controlled clinical studies , a dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was not detected by placebo in comparison to placebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets led to adults and adolescents in clinical studies to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ ologist .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol was not imp@@ aired by the simultaneous intake of alcohol to a gain of alcohol @-@ induced power .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic Rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the reduction of symptoms such as ni@@ es , nostr@@ o secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and ro@@ cking of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as based on the total score of the questionnaire at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us pills effectively reduced the A@@ eri@@ us pills effectively through seasonal allerg@@ y r@@ hin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective at the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the size of t@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
the prevalence of this restri@@ ctive phenomenon was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ up@@ form of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic Rhin@@ itis , which has been restricted .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no application points for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient Kum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin @-@ sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ley , however , was not identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for protection against flu , which caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which may cause a strain of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus that may cause a future pan@@ demic .
an influenza pan@@ demic dis@@ appears when a new trunk of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus can easily be di@@ visible by humans because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system contained the immune system contained in the vaccine of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus as &quot; physical foreign &quot; and forms antibodies .
as a result , the immune system is able to form faster antibody in contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus .
afterwards , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , det@@ ects the human body as body strange ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this makes the scope of clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for preventive vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment , please contact your treatment doctor .
if you wish any further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the purchased immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution to insert , but this can not be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be classified , if the doctor has checked , who has taken an an@@ tivir@@ al drug of the patient before , and the probability that the virus will speak to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of al@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV amount in blood and maintains it at a low level .
AIDS is not able to cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system and so that the development of AIDS related diseases and diseases are delayed .
A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants .
the group of low @-@ treated R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medic@@ inal gen@@ ase has been taken at 206 adults who had previously taken earlier Prot@@ ects , with other prot@@ eas@@ ants .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ al last ) or the change of vir@@ al load after treatment .
in the studies of patients who had previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ ants had taken after 48 weeks under A@@ gen@@ ase , more patients had an vir@@ al load below 400 copies / ml as under placebo but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ al load , but was treated with the children who had previously been treated with fe@@ asi@@ bility , only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants were treated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drugs A@@ gen@@ ase , the vir@@ al load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other protests , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ al last after four weeks than in the patient who continued its previous Prot@@ eas@@ ant .
the most common adverse events of as@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ass@@ ure and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase shall not be used in patients who are likely to be sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other ingredients .
A@@ gen@@ ase cannot also be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medic@@ inal products , which are also dismant@@ led in the blood of health and in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as in case of other medicines with HIV , the gen@@ ase should take the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ess@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) or a immune activ@@ ator ( symptoms of an infection that caused by a relaxing immune system ) .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines prescribed by HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee presented that the benefits of gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously did not have been proven .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; since the time of approval from scientific reasons for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited an authorization for the placing of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , protests inhibit@@ or ( PI ) prescribed adults and children 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist Boo@@ bs of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution is reduced by 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ det@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 When A@@ gen@@ ase capsules can be applied without the rein@@ forcement addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ kl@@ ets ) , higher doses of as@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines at 2400 mg am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not examined in children .
gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for in@@ compatibility and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic data , the dose to as@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function of 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use should be observed in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase cannot be used simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ate the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um mot@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reducing plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be noted that gen@@ eric bladder or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to the healing of HIV infection , and that they also may develop opportun@@ istic infections , or other complic@@ ations of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with gen@@ eric ase does not prevent the risk of trans@@ ference from HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal progress .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with existing restricted liver function including chronic active hepatitis demonstrate an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ kok@@ or@@ ti@@ ids are not recommended , unless the possible use of treatment is the risk of systematic cor@@ ti@@ ary effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ni@@ otic function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the adjustment of the H@@ MG Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duction Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous dosing of Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Phen@@ om@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ yl anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm ) are available .
in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be reduced to less effective plasma tor@@ ment of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ tiv@@ a can be changed , however , information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ omes , especially if there are still low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of a tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ actic acid content of the gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is suff@@ ici@@ ently inde@@ xed under the age of four years and should be applied to certain other patient groups .
gen@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ or , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ alt@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to have been necessary for treatment with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment , associated with met@@ abolic disorders .
in hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports on an increase of blood cells including spont@@ aneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ ome and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
at the time of the introduction of a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial Ae@@ ge@@ ology is assumed ( including application of Kor@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ o@@ deficiency , higher body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose particularly in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width of gen@@ ase , not simultaneously possess with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ e@@ avi@@ r may not be conf@@ used together with drugs , whose ingredients are mainly associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma level with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
in an attempt to compens@@ ate the plasma plasma by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects were observed at the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rate ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be ab@@ ased through the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um mot@@ atum ) .
when a patient particip@@ ates as the Order of Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ det@@ av@@ our@@ al mirror and if possible , add the vir@@ al load and add the cur@@ is@@ raut .
a dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ er@@ ir@@ enz ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ det@@ avi@@ r twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r have been applied twice daily with efficacy and in@@ fertil@@ ity of this treatment schem@@ es .
52 % lower when am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained at the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a narrow monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and in@@ fertil@@ ity of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical study on the application of al@@ gen@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ is@@ ci@@ ary component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene , it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and gen@@ eric ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
for this reason , a dose of dose is required in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with liz@@ ard ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both proteins would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data may be avoided by Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , so Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is due to be reduced because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma glucose .
if this medication is used together , is careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be made , as an exact forecast of the combination of the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ ph@@ ut@@ in lead to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ ph@@ ut@@ in around 193 % , resulting in a rise in adverse reactions .
if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ph@@ ut@@ in combined with gen@@ ase , will be recommended to reduce the dose of ri@@ pen@@ ile in at least half of the recommended dose even though there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic studies with gen@@ eric @-@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , but the plasma level of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the con@@ current use of twice daily dose of 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ h@@ avi@@ ol taken once a day to increase the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol to the 2,@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value , which was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol at once daily without a con@@ current use of f@@ os@@ amp@@ mu@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs , which are listed below , including substr@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with gen@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be associated to toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines when used in combination with gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other proteins , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ volcan@@ ic acid that are known as an enzyme ( phen@@ yl to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ det@@ avi@@ r can lead to a path@@ ric plasma of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channels like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ di@@ pin , se@@ di@@ di@@ pin , an@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ di@@ pin , Nij@@ me@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and j@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing activity and tox@@ icity of this drug may be increased .
the simultaneous intake with gen@@ eric bladder can significantly increase plasma concentration and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side effects including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ations , visual disorders and prim@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg of fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) increased over 7 days to the subjects , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol climbed about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
thus , the simultaneous gift of gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these Glu@@ k@@ or@@ ti@@ ids , unless it weighs the possible benefit of a treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ ary effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ induc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends heavily from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases the plasma level with an early administration of al@@ gen@@ ase .
since Plas@@ ma@@ ids of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ induc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can result in my@@ opath@@ y including a li@@ hab@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended .
a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations of up to stabil@@ ization of mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the benefit of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied together with oral Mi@@ z@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while in case of an early application of gen@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is careful .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ants indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3- to 4 @-@ feet .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered with am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ omas , especially if there are still low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical default , no recommendation can be given , as the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r dose is given at the same time when am@@ det@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on .
with an early gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ tic antibodies combined with A@@ gen@@ ase , a reinforced check of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ diction is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods are recommended to the recipi@@ ent .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for the benefit of gen@@ eric bladder ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful def@@ ending of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk activ@@ ating rats , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a re@@ productive study on imp@@ aired rats , which was administered in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during nurs@@ ing time .
the further development of offspring including Fertil@@ ity and Re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the in@@ fertil@@ ity of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and in children 4 years of clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most of the patients connected to the gen@@ ase @-@ side effects were slightly up until moderate , early in the early stage , and carried out rarely to the treatment of treatment .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with regard to as@@ gen@@ ase or any other at the same time as HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects date from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which he did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg al@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated in connection with the study medication , and were performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as under treatment of medical laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) with HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and the so@@ vi@@ ate fat collection ( bul@@ lets ) .
at 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated persons , which were treated with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was observed only a case ( bul@@ ky ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , with 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - previously treated patients under Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 patients ( 11 % ) compared to 27 patients at In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
skin envelop@@ es were usually slightly until moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ kul@@ op@@ ap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without ju@@ ck@@ ily and occurred spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without knowing the treatment with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were especially reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of the introduction of a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
at PI &apos;s treated patients , the 600 mg of gen@@ eric disease were observed twice daily with low do@@ si@@ onal R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) , patients who received gen@@ eric r@@ gen@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ onal R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r were frequently performed .
in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are required .

the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was tested both in acute and chronic l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in peripheral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is found in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined yet .

companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( partitions ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpretation results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cru@@ de resistance against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cru@@ de resistance between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ er ra@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients , a resistance against L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 ins@@ om@@ avi@@ r ) , fi@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ult ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 ins@@ ult ) .
vice vers@@ a , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains his activity against some other prot@@ ector resistant insul@@ ating agents ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the ins@@ ades .
early departure of a sin@@ uous therapy is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in bound@@ aries who can aff@@ ecting the following treatment .
the proof of the efficacy of al@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open study ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ y ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with an PI , mainly with a lower R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ st@@ ert , &quot; received .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with downstream virus sensitivity to gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group in the Vir@@ al last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , in case of non @-@ under@@ disease fluctu@@ ations from 0.4 to 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the efficacy of untreated A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution was administered in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low do@@ si@@ r R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on these data should be considered within the treatment of therapy with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
according to oral dosing , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous dietary absorption influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l / kg ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume and a det@@ oxi@@ fying penetration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from blood circulation in the t@@ issues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of active ingredient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r which represents the active proportion probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of non @-@ bound Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active components in the Ste@@ ady state concentration in Ste@@ ady @-@ State during the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore drugs must represent the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induced or in@@ hib@@ itions or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution appropriate if they are given simultaneously with gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 , and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ onn@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ available as of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a million@@ th base .
even the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function is likely to be reduced to elim@@ ination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to am@@ det@@ avi@@ r plasma plasma levels comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ det@@ avi@@ r twice daily without a simultaneous dosing of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in male animals h@@ epat@@ oma h@@ epat@@ oma Aden@@ omes , which spoke with the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8- times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ det@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ular Aden@@ omes and Car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
in the present evaluation data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from therapeutic use , however , are not advis@@ able for acceptance of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro genital tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test to rats and chromosome ab@@ err@@ atic test in human peripheral l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of al@@ gen@@ ase , nor after the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity at vir@@ gins , which were treated at ages 4 days , showed up a high mortality rate in the control units as well as with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
in a systematic plasma exposition , significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosing was observed , however , a number of minor changes including th@@ ym@@ us ong@@ ation and low @-@ grown sk@@ ill@@ ary changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 When A@@ gen@@ ase capsules can be applied without the rein@@ forcement addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ kl@@ ets ) , higher doses of as@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines at 2400 mg am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be observed in patients with a weak or lighter liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Phen@@ om@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ yl anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm ) are available .
gen@@ ase should be reduced to duration 27 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment , associated with met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained at the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a narrow monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and in@@ fertil@@ ity of this combination is not known .
the treatment with liz@@ ard ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both proteins would be low .
if this medication is used together , is careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be made , as an exact forecast of the combination of the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ph@@ ut@@ in combined with gen@@ ase , will be recommended to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ ph@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose for 31 , although no clinical data is required .
the serum concentrations of calcium channels like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ di@@ pin , se@@ di@@ pin , an@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ di@@ di@@ pin , Nij@@ me@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg of fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) increased over 7 days to the subjects , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol climbed about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with an early gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ tic antibodies combined with A@@ gen@@ ase , a reinforced check of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r by 22 %
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful def@@ ending of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the F@@ öt@@ us .
a re@@ productive study on imp@@ aired rats , which was administered by the in@@ ni@@ fication in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding time of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during post@@ age .
the in@@ fertil@@ ity of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and in children 4 years of clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are required .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is found in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
vice vers@@ a , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains his activity against some other prot@@ ector resistant insul@@ ating agents ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the ins@@ ades .
based on these data , the therapy should be considered to be considered as expected for the benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
while the absolute concentration of non @-@ bound Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active components in the Ste@@ ady state concentration in Ste@@ ady @-@ State during the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s ..

even the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function is likely to be reduced to elim@@ ination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ul@@ atory Aden@@ omes appeared in dos@@ ages with doses of 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8- times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after a daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ det@@ avi@@ r languages .
the under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ular Aden@@ omes and Car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , a little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings , however , are derived from the present evaluation data on humans , both of clinical trials and therapeutic conditions .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro genital tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test to rats and chromosome ab@@ err@@ atic test in human peripheral l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ at@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on tox@@ icity at vir@@ gins , which were treated at ages 4 days , showed up a high mortality rate in the control units as well as with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
these results indicate that in young the met@@ abolic paths are not fully mature , so Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase Solution to take part in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or ( PI ) prescribed adults and children 4 years of age are displayed .
the benefits of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; b@@ oo@@ ast@@ ter &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase solution to capture was neither treated with PI previously treated patients with PI .
the bio availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution is reduced by 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules after taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous application of as@@ gen@@ ase solution to insert and low do@@ si@@ onal R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patient groups .
even though a dose adaptation for am@@ det@@ avi@@ r is not necessary , an application of as@@ gen@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk content of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ actic acid content , A@@ gen@@ ase solution is used for infants and children under 4 years of pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver damage and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competent inhibit@@ or of the metabolism of this medicine and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects such as cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z .
the patients should be noted that gen@@ eric bladder or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to the healing of HIV infection , and that it also continues to develop opportun@@ istic infections , or other complic@@ ations of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with gen@@ eric ase prevents the risk of dying from HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ yl @-@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm ) , methods are available to determine the active concentration of substances .

the applic@@ ants and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the treatment of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a to a maximum of 16 weeks . • For small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma is applied during one or two @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is hidden in front of the sleep th@@ inner to the affected skin areas , so that it remains sufficient ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a has been compared to placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ p in the genital area for 16 weeks .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete breakdown of treated War@@ ning . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks or al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with full healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ os@@ hen .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a is more effective than the placebo . • The results of both studies were treated in all four main studies 15 % to 52 % of patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a patients , but only 3 % to 80 % of patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions in the scope of application of the cream ( p@@ ains or it@@ ching ) .

treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all the visible f@@ eig@@ es in the genital or periods are gone , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the above treatment procedure should be determined when intensive local inflamm@@ ation occur ( see section 4.4 ) , or if in the treatment area an infection is observed .
in case of follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was dropped , the patient can bear the cream when he / she noticed this and continue with the usual treatment plan .
put the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and to gr@@ ate them in a thin layer of gr@@ ate skin area until the cream is completely covered .
it should be observed in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk of its auto@@ immune disease .
it should be observed in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk of a possible organ or Gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , there were no daily pre @-@ auth@@ ori@@ y@@ ene , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and a case with a pr@@ un@@ circumcision are observed .
at an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses have increased risk for severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , there were also severe local skin irrit@@ ation that caused a treatment and / or through a temporary impair@@ ment .
in cases , where such reactions had appeared at the output of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had trouble with water , which require emergency c@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly in connection to a treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ers in the genital and Peri@@ odic range , there are no clinical experience before .
limited data may indicate a increased rate of f@@ eig@@ war@@ cen@@ aries in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips or hair@@ pin is not examined .
local skin reaction are often , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ eness of the local skin reaction , a treatment break of several days may be made .
the clinical outcome of therapy can be judged after the re@@ generation of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment .
there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be drawn with super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma other suitable therap@@ ies .
in patients with recur@@ rent and previously treated B@@ CC@@ s , there are no clinical experience before , therefore the application of previously treated tum@@ ors are not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not included for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os@@ hen on eyel@@ ids , in the inside of the nose or ears , or on the lip@@ stick area within the lift .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os@@ hen at anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis on the poor and hands support the effectiveness in this purpose of use , therefore a such application is not recommended .
local skin tre@@ ads occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the therapy or go after the treatment of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin actions to the patient cause large dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment can be suspended for some days .
out of the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ ekeeping missions is lower than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be used with caution in patients who received an immune treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

according to the test plan , assessment of clinical evidence shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently are frequent into local skin reaction including ery@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion / leaves ( 23 % ) and oil ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , assessment of clinical signs shows that it was very common in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often to severe ery@@ thema migran@@ t ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe rec@@ itals ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the investigation of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment of treatment or in the surrounding area .
the extraordinary single @-@ unique recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized according to or@@ aler or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic investigation , the system@@ ic concentrations of the Alpine inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected after the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ od with a I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is superior to a placebo treatment over 16 weeks .
in 60 % of all 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es treated completely . this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo treated by placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete demol@@ ition could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 treated with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :

in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown during these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks )
a minimal system@@ ic recording of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in three times of weekly use during 16 weeks .
the highest medication concentrations observed in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / poor ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended re@@ tention of medication in the skin .
data to the system@@ ic exposure showed that the oral care of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application of patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and similar was similar to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis , or super @-@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the final tox@@ icity at the rat no cans of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg . kg was significantly reduced in weight of body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a four months long study showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice had no tum@@ ours on three days a week .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption from human skin and not mut@@ ually , is a risk for man due to systematic exposure than very low .

although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients were based on the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient proved the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a for@@ ged exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 metres .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group and the capability of lung function , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group , as from the following table .
the decline of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly reduced over this period of clinical and absolute pul@@ mon@@ ina increased steadily to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atomic fact reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ ine ) was established , which remained constant up until the study .
regarding the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between patients who summar@@ izes significant changes for five efficacy variable values ( expected in 6 @-@ minute walk , movement of the shoulder @-@ gel@@ ks AH@@ I and visual acuity ) , was generally a decrease in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
an independent phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigated in 20 patients , who were under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the severe decline @-@ in form and 4 with the middle displacement form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental speed of patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form only limited or no progress in the cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study examinations were performed on pharmac@@ ological effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ es to the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing system with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usi@@ ons , a represented alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( one other drugs against cancer ) , which is not affected by cancer ( cancer against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) , the cancer has already increased to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the plate epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have previously been treated yet , in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who had previously applied other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , as well as several therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should receive a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) treatment and inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be taken before or after the administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally a &quot; anti @-@ emet@@ ry &quot; ( Medic@@ ines against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood image changes or during which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be removed or reduced the dose .
the active Form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed into its active shape is lighter than in healthy cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of drugs and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer were the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with advanced or metastatic disease , previously untreated with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a other drugs against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further drugs against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were recorded on average 12,@@ 1 month compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who previously had received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared with 7,9 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients were unable to attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells in which the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta has increased survival times as compared with the basis agent .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. an authorization for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle has to be adjusted with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride inj@@ ectors ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ cking point is taken from the flow rate and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride inj@@ ectors ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with logic advanced or metastatic @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after closing the p@@ emet@@ ry - In@@ fusion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
reduction of incidence and sever@@ eness of skin reaction must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after treatment .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of p@@ emet@@ ry to be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid and intake must be continued during the entire treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ ry .
patients also need to receive in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ ry dose as well as after every third day cycle .
in patients who get p@@ emet@@ ry should be created before every gift a complete blood image , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the al@@ cal phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose test must take place under the Con@@ dition of the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre@@ valent therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA , until the patient must be the value before the treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled after patients after 2 dose induc@@ tive tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ jour@@ - at the appearance of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above , compared to patients at the age of 65 , an increased ad@@ den@@ i@@ - ko consists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data for in@@ compatibility and effectiveness .
in clinical studies , in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dose custom@@ iz@@ ations were necessary due to the recommended dose custom@@ iz@@ ations recommended for all patients .
data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; 1.5 times the upper image value ( near the case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not especially studied in the studies .
patients have to be monitored and are used in view of the bone structure and will not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number returned to a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ic number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ant and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as observed in the preceding treatment cycles - see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ th@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was observed when a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 was taken place .
therefore all patients have to be treated with emet@@ ry treated patients , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must have a simultaneous in@@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ alism ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who have been used for treatment with emet@@ emet@@ re@@ xed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with emet@@ ry . ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients receiving these events , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , prior to hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clinical @-@ significant fluid - collection in trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ ining of the ergonom@@ ics may be replaced before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cr@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with emet@@ emet@@ ry occasionally , if this active ingredient was administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life dim@@ mer is not recommended ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is conden@@ sed ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage - re@@ productive capacity of re@@ productive capacity should be noted , men should be noted before treatment - G@@ inn , advice about to pick up .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ lo@@ gistic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced rate reduction of adverse reactions .
therefore , be careful when used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ alism ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with sp@@ emet@@ ry .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the od@@ inn@@ ess status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires a increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm ) when the decision was hit by patients with oral anti @-@ antibodies .
there are no data for the use of b@@ emet@@ re@@ xed at pregnant women , but as with an@@ gu@@ itars anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected in pregnancy heavy birth defects .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed cannot be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful def@@ ending of the use for the mother and the risk for the F@@ öt@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of re@@ productive capacity should be noted , men should be noted before the treatment of treatment , advice regarding the treatment of sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into the breast milk goes and un@@ wanted effects during the inf@@ ant inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti @-@ emet@@ ry ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemical therap@@ ies , which are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , a strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy alone ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 out of 185 ) .
compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued the Company of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . an authorization for the placing on the market of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before chemotherapy given by Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ est passage , patients should be monitored by an@@ am@@ nesty decre@@ asing or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful with the benefit of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or by patients , with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or extending to such an extension .
except in connection with another chemical therap@@ ists , Alo@@ xi should neither be used in the days after chemotherapy nor to the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies of hem@@ oph@@ os@@ et@@ ron the five analysed chemical therap@@ ists not ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ id@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ ques , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cle@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not in front of human pregn@@ an@@ cies , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is necessary by the treatment doctor .
in clinical studies the most common adverse events of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least could possibly stood with alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and care p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of su@@ pers@@ ens@@ ity actions and reactions in the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar skins of adverse events showed themselves in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose active relationships .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably is probably not effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ do@@ cking .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies total of 1.@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 cy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 cy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of dol@@ ph@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received an intraven@@ ous day 1 without D@@ aug@@ eth@@ as@@ ron intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients were treated with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were randomised to day 1 intraven@@ ous .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and study with heavily em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indications of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the channels on the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation participating I@@ onic channels and extend the duration of the action .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EK@@ G effects of I.@@ V. administered in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption According to intraven@@ ous gift followed an initial decrease of plasma concentration on an initial elim@@ ination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , which was measured at 11 ho@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
derived from pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic simul@@ ations that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days , overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with the approval of 0.75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the starting point of 0.75 mg was higher .
elim@@ in@@ ates about 40 % over the kidneys , and around 50 % will be converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abolic studies have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has participated in Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered active ingredient made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ tion in response time the total mass was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function , the terminal elim@@ in@@ gement response time and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases a reduction of the dose , however , is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate across the maximum human@@ ist exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 out of pre@@ clinical trials indicates that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ onic channels , which can extend to the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ formation and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was given in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a higher frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ thel@@ ium Ne@@ op@@ las@@ m ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , tri@@ ni@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors at rats , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and because Alo@@ xi is appointed for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be low as for humans .
the holders of this approval must be submitted to the European Commission on the plans for the placing on the market in the framework of this decision approved by the Commission .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative reference to the approval of the approval of hepatitis C which was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon has a biological medicine named Ro@@ inter@@ feron @-@ A with the same general practition@@ er , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference value &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease prog@@ ressing ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue transplan@@ ts is further increased , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the active ingredient .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data before , prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ inter@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition , purity of medication , efficiency , safety and efficacy at hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference value to 455 patients .
in the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distri@@ butions of this document is Author@@ ised for non business operators only , the EMEA region . what were the greatest concern that the CH@@ MP grants to the recommendation for placing on the market ?
furthermore , concerns are reported that the data to the stability of the active material and the drug should not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C which talked to the treatment of Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon fl@@ amed the disease in more patients more than at the reference value ; Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test was conducted in the study test for the examination of the question , where the medicine forms a immune response ( i.e. the body is antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pet@@ igo ( one with a cruci@@ fixes ) and small in@@ fic@@ ated Laz@@ er@@ ations ( r@@ iss@@ or or cut @-@ up ) .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not used for the treatment of infections , which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go against this kind of infections may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient and remove alternative treatments to the patient .
it acts through block of bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , where proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main Indi@@ cator of the effectiveness was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was exp@@ elled after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients were treated under placebo .
Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates showed : if the results were taken together with skin irrit@@ ation , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups were treated to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go is found in the treatment of wast@@ eland ( eit@@ ful hollow ceilings in the body tissue ) or by infections , which were proven or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective .
the most common tri@@ but@@ ary with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the client .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections from the risks : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , depreciation or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . an authorization for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients , with which no improvements could be demonstrated within two to three days , should be considered once and an alternative treatment can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a Sen@@ si@@ ze@@ al or heavy local dis@@ rit@@ ation caused by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is abor@@ ted , the oint@@ ment is carefully f@@ ished and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection has begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen or is thought ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in secondary operations , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , was in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected spot .
the impact of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentration based on human use , a clinical @-@ relevant inhibit@@ or should not be expected in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg c@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment on the di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dose custom@@ iz@@ ations are not required to be applied when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a Re@@ productive distribution according to or@@ aler taking and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to prevent a systematic anti@@ bi@@ otic system .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / ends or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go / ends , is between the benefit of the nurs@@ ing for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most common adverse events of Ir@@ rit@@ ation had an appointment of about 1 % of the patients .
the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance which is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus ( earlier Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on a selective inhibit@@ or of the bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding at the 50s under@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which diff@@ ers from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sin@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the co@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen P @-@ binder and pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ centre .
by connecting to this binding station hem@@ med P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block partly P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler subjects .
should be determined based on the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some inf@@ ectious diseases should be advised by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ respon@@ sive to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ atory factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and raised on the skin for up to 7 days .
of 516 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were won .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording on humans after top@@ ical use of 1 % oint@@ ment to 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
met@@ abolic ism in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under the lower participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro check on gen@@ mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in human peripheral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vivo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither by male nor female rats for female fertil@@ ity at oral dosing of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which makes up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest exposure of human exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 cm2 )
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats were detected at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development tools ( reduced body weight ) and matern@@ al tox@@ icity .
the holder of the approval must ensure that a pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ ator system , as in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application order will be presented ( version 6.2 ) and works before the product is mark@@ eted and as long as the product is used .
the holders of approval for the market will be obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ ma activities , as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which will be agreed with CH@@ MP .
as described in CH@@ MP &quot; Guidel@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for Human use &quot; for human use , the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report .
irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated point , you should end the application of al@@ tar@@ go and speak with your doctor .
don &apos;t forget any other oint@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lo@@ ons on the area that is treated with Al@@ tar@@ go , if it was not expressly agreed to your doctor .
it may not be used in the eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or female genital area .
when the Sal@@ vation is visible on one of these areas , wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice , if complaints occur .
after the fixing of the oint@@ ment you can cover the affected area with a steril@@ ization association or a gaz@@ e@@ cover , unless your doctor has come to cover the area .
it is offered in aluminium tube with a plastic cap , which contains 5 , 10 or 15 gram of salt , or in a aluminium bag , the 0,5 g Sal@@ be contains .
Ambi@@ ent is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( sick@@ ness , which affects the liver ) in children between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied within two doses of existing vacc@@ ines , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , which can be ensured from two doses of the vacc@@ ination .
if a review is desired with hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines may work by preventing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can do against a disease .
after a child received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the Twin@@ rix adult vacc@@ ines since 1996 and the vaccine vaccine for Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against the same diseases , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within three doses of existing vacc@@ ination .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the patron of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite , pain on the injection station , tube , mat ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may now react sensiti@@ vely to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ etic s.@@ a. permission to the public transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standard di@@ min@@ able plan for the plan di@@ mm@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose at the appointment of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the initial dose .
if a review is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , it may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) antibodies observed in the same size order as according to vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet completely secured whether immun@@ competent individuals who need on a Hepatitis B vacc@@ ination as protection , since it is possibly protected by the immune memory .
3 As in all inj@@ ections , for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the standard di@@ mm@@ ing scheme is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units formal@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B Surface an@@ tigen contains .
in hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , an adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies is achieved so that in these cases , the administration of other vacc@@ ines may be required .
as an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration could result in the glut@@ eal muscles to a sub@@ optimal Imp@@ air@@ way , these injection det@@ ours should be avoided .
in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ie or bleeding problems , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases , as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular gifts .
if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of a separate injection at the same time , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ an@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined meas@@ les vaccine , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients below immun@@ os@@ ci@@ si@@ ent therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , ro@@ cking , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ologist , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fever comparable with the frequency , which was observed at former Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative vaccine vaccine .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix was administered to a total of 10@@ 27 Imp@@ air@@ ings at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants from 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination .
only exceptions were the higher skins of pain and mat@@ ures on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination of Ambi@@ rix , but not at a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects had been administered , on pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose .
however , the frequency of Matcha was not comparable ( i.e. , above the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ cans .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ory was small and comparable to achieve the combination of combination with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1- up to 11 @-@ year @-@ old Imp@@ fl@@ ingen , the occurr@@ ence of local actions and allerg@@ y actions in the ambient temperature was comparable with the 3 @-@ doses combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , the 6 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old man was reported a common appearance of p@@ ains ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per subject .
the percentage of Imp@@ fl@@ ingen , which above severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ cans vaccine schem@@ as with the combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units formal@@ ise the combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B , was statistically not different .
in clinical trials , which were carried out at Imp@@ fl@@ ingen at the age of 1 to 15 years , were the ser@@ o@@ con@@ sion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ con@@ sion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study , which was carried out with 12- and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses have received two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 with three doses .
for the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity rates were evaluated ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose im@@ pulses significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ ity , which were achieved in a clinical study study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the Imp@@ fl@@ inge received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units . in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination .
the immune reaction observed in this study was similar to both anti@@ gens that according to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination sim@@ pler , consisting of 360 ELISA units formal@@ in@@ activated h@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0,5 ml .
in a clinical study with 12- and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old showed that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies resulting 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life with the review of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ous pol@@ o @-@ vacc@@ ination ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ öt@@ tle vacc@@ ination is enough , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ations and ser@@ o@@ con@@ sion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is available both before and after res@@ us@@ sion by eyel@@ ids at any foreign particles and / or physi@@ kal@@ isch visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as through Baden in through wast@@ ew@@ es waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a bl@@ est face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that possibly make a stationary treatment .
as in all vaccine , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect completely from an infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( though you are not yet un@@ likely to feel un@@ likely or sick / feels ) may not prevent the vacc@@ ination of a disease .
a protection against other infections which cause the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those of hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by ju@@ ck@@ ering skin envelop@@ es , breath@@ less or sw@@ elling of the face or the tongue . • if you have occurred an allergic reaction on an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • if you have a severe infection with fever / her .
• if you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the estimated delivery of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you your child from an vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective substances per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a formal@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vacc@@ ination with reduced content to an effective content is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix people who suffer heavy bleeding disorders caused by the skin and not weak@@ ened in the muscle . • if you are not weak@@ ened to a disease or treatment in your / its body &apos;s sake , or if you / your child becomes a hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these people can &apos;t be sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on vacc@@ ination .
21 Say you your doctor if you have received another medicines , or if you have been vacc@@ inated with no loss ; or if you have been vacc@@ inated with or if you have been vacc@@ inated or Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) , or this is planned for the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as different lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or just before or after a injection of Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is probably that the response to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women is not administered , except it is ur@@ gently necessary that they are vacc@@ inated with hepatitis A as hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction on Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of data , which has been announced since the initial approval of the market , the CH@@ MP has positive the view that the value @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
because Ambi@@ rix was only associated with a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to small patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ ition can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ full En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial endo@@ thel@@ ial cells in the pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ey@@ es@@ eed - split on several single doses to meals - failed , under the food mixed or via Gast@@ rust@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nostr@@ ils ( through the nose in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
it was no comparative study , as am@@ od@@ aps cannot be compared to another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without the active ingredient ) .
am@@ mon@@ ition may also result on appet@@ ite , a abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability and flav@@ our@@ able version , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , r@@ p@@ ation , un@@ certain body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ am@@ aps in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ium values can be effective .
am@@ mon@@ ition was admitted under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval , only limited information on this drug .
the use of all patients will be inde@@ xed in all patients with a full En@@ z@@ ym@@ s in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ defin@@ ite form ( in@@ complete tail @-@ def@@ ective , who is manifested after the first CV ) , there is an indication for use if in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese exists a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to kill tablets or for patients with sl@@ u@@ ck@@ ily , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually toler@@ ated taking into account the protein tolerance and the development required daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose is sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg and in adults .
for patients who suffer from an early @-@ mani@@ y@@ phosphate cas@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ad@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ats@@ yn@@ thetic deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ low disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) of sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with contra@@ sted cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ alities and oil formation only with caution .
since met@@ abolic and differentiation of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ cted ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift from phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate to young rats in a high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural failure and a reduced loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ sen and a reduced number of functional nerv@@ es in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be detected if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate has left breast milk in breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients were at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) , and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old ano@@ vic patient , who developed a met@@ abolic disease , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ yt@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dosage occurred within a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms continue with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which showed an dos@@ si@@ onal neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity at an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound that con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ ylene with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine using the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is similar to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the differentiation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is begun immediately to improve survival and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early release of the disease with the occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their st@@ ick@@ ed free analogue products within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ed k@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase survival rate as recently as post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life of the month ) to increase their disease to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ defin@@ itive form of the disease ( including female patients with h@@ etero@@ zy@@ g@@ um bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency , which were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet was the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat oxi@@ des to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and neph@@ ew with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ments for so@@ aking healthy adults and in patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of up to 20 g / day ( non controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ opath@@ ic treatment was det@@ ectable in plasma after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day by in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration camps on the third day five times higher than according to the first gifts .
differentiation The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the shape of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses treated as non @-@ toxic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h according to oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken by oral ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ low emission ) or a Nas@@ en@@ onde .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose is sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg and in adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular , bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and Ser@@ um@@ proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal area .
for patients who suffer from an early @-@ mani@@ y@@ phosphate cas@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ad@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) of sodium per gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ t@@ les were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active met@@ able of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of brain cells .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old ano@@ vic patient , who developed a met@@ abolic disease , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ yt@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is similar to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to compens@@ ate excess
on the basis of examinations about the differentiation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were detected 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
with this approach , the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved before use in water ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so that they can not leave the st@@ icky waste products that cannot be ex@@ crete after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory tests , you must notify the doctor that you can influence AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
for taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when you have taken other drugs or recently , even if it is not subject to pres@@ cription drug .
during the breast@@ feeding time you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the drug could over@@ pass through the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , flav@@ ours , taste disorders , ref@@ res@@ cent , deser@@ ti@@ bility , and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states were observed .
if you are looking for one of these symptoms , use immediately with your doctor or with the emergency recovery of your hospital to the introduction of an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to forget AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

for taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when you have taken other drugs or recently , even if it is not subject to pres@@ cription drug .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed over the same single doses or via a Mag@@ enf@@ ist@@ el ( hose which runs through the abdom@@ inal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose probe ( tube , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the breast@@ plate with different strength ) or my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ do &quot; ( a abnormal measuring value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ac or EK@@ G ) .
angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who continue to under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion may continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintaining blood flow in the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at the treatment of An@@ gi@@ ox in sole gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) with conventional combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( a different antibodies ) and a G@@ PI .
while the PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) , and they received other drugs to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
at the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from G@@ PI - the prevention of new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases , or Rev@@ as@@ kul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year , as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go one PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as H@@ ep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding , with which it was much more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox cannot be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other ingredients .
it also cannot be used in patients who had a blood pressure , as well as humans with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable replacement for H@@ ep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd an authorization for the placing on the market of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of an emergency attack or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is done in a row a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
according to the PCI requirements , the reduced inf@@ usi@@ an dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be accepted for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with one PCI is comprised of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of the intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if the value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be made .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before applying the application and the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney limitations ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second leg dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is again to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which was included in the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Bol@@ us without a dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be re@@ directed 30 minutes after the treatment of the intraven@@ ous H@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift from Lower H@@ ep@@ arin .
• He@@ av@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • Active bleeding or higher risk of blood disorders due to interference of hem@@ mo@@ ist system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial En@@ doc@@ itis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ se@@ cular patients
patients are carefully selected during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti @-@ antibodies ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if using PCI @-@ patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most bleeding may occur in patients who occur in a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during treatment of prin@@ cip@@ ation everywhere .
in patients who are treated with war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ radiation , a surveillance of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International norm rates ) should be applied to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine should be reached again before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanisms of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( H@@ ep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ol@@ y@@ tics , or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ers ) , it may be assumed that these effici@@ encies are due to increase blood .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ates or anti @-@ glob@@ ular clusters , the clinical and organic hem@@ ost@@ ic parameters are regularly control in every case .
in respect to the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , development or post@@ nat@@ al development are in@@ sufficient ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the treated groups in women and patients over 65 years were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined in table 2 according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i .
both light and heavy bleeding was significantly less frequently than in groups with H@@ ep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
a AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy blood has been defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular hyper@@ tension , intra@@ ocular pressure level of ≥ 5 g / dl with known blood flow , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ lowing of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood flow , operation due to a blood pressure , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .

the following side effects , which are not listed above have been reported after extensive application in practice , and are summarized in table 6 according to system organs .
in case of an over@@ dosage , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately break immediately and the patient close to the signs of a blood pressure .
An@@ gi@@ ox includes Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ s that bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and in the an@@ ion@@ ic region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ m@@ ud@@ ine in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thereby its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ nor@@ ed the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , resulting in re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ m@@ ud@@ ine , serum of patients who came in the past to h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia / h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was induced .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in shows an dos@@ si@@ - and concentration @-@ dependent effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
in case of patients below one PCI was done , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine should be increased and the infusion is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected the upper th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or used as a continuous use of a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient ins@@ ulin on the blood glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or does not process the ins@@ ulin in the blood .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly from human@@ ins@@ ulin and the change means that it works faster and a shorter duration of human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body does not produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.14 % in ins@@ ulin @-@ pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % of human gest@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who suffer from a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when it is administered with a number of other drugs , which can be used on the blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH an authorization for the placing on A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdom@@ inal ceiling , or for delay or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdom@@ en .
due to the reduced Glu@@ kon@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced ins@@ ulin demand , the ins@@ ulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of the effici@@ encies , the stamp ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin delay ( normal , N@@ PH , interest @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or manufacturing method can withdraw a change in the ins@@ ulin demand .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or the termination of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and a diabet@@ ic can@@ v@@ ac@@ ia . these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
change@@ over of a patient on another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin at any other manufacturer should be done under str@@ ingent supervision and can make a change in dosage .
the time of a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia depends on the efficiency profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change to conversion of treatment .

severe h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ cheese with awareness can be given by means of in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an intraven@@ ous person , or treated through an intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose projection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ ine cause for the severe h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia and similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripheral glucose ( especially through sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ aneous G@@ a- be of ins@@ ulin in efficiency occurs faster and the duration is shorter than hu@@ - man@@ em .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ ulin showed ins@@ ulin @-@ relevant glu@@ ing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glu@@ kos@@ an effect , exactly like human ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast active ingredients such as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieved the complete glu@@ ing effect for about 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
from the data was evident that at an application of ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ic glyc@@ em@@ ic control is given as with human gest@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ulin was applied in 2 minutes before the meal , there was a better post@@ graduate control than with human gest@@ ins@@ ulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ulin is turned into 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable glyc@@ em@@ ic control as in human gest@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given to 2 ten@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin had 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human gest@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L ) before a meal was given ( Figure 1B ) .
ins@@ ulin had given 15 minutes before the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
