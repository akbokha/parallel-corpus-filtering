it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg processed cheese tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not available ) , mis@@ sil@@ es and wounds ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psychological disease , where the patients are man@@ age@@ ing ( periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy is used for the treatment of heavy @-@ severe episodes and preventive episodes in patients who spoke in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral medication is not possible .
in both cases the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the melting tablet chains in patients who prepar@@ es the sl@@ u@@ cks of tablets trouble .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time as A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells using &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ ge@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of ner@@ ve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol works probably in particular as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin and D@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ itter acts as the recept@@ ors to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ian symptoms and their recovery will be avoided .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy , that to prevent symptoms occur in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy was over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy and placebo that were to be stabil@@ ized on 160 patients with which the man@@ ian symptoms have already been stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy injection solution was caused in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance that suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psychological ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients were based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also led studies to investigate such as the body uses the melting tablet and the solution to absorb res@@ or@@ ating ( up ) .
in both studies with the injection solution showed patients that received A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms were increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a placebo .
in the application to treat the bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy was reduced in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ian symptoms .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo in previously treated episodes at previously treated patients and when it was given in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo the symptoms were afflicted and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , head@@ ache ( dil@@ ution ) , sy@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( se@@ clu@@ sion ) , ab@@ normal@@ ities ( di@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , s@@ ali@@ es ( di@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , s@@ ali@@ va ( di@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , s@@ ali@@ va ( higher memory production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion ( increased memory production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness and exhau@@ st@@ ion , o@@ lic@@ o@@ irs , in@@ som@@ eb@@ ody ( sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ) and anxi@@ ety .
the conclusion for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and of medium @-@ severe episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ian episodes and in which the man@@ ian episodes had to treat the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of breast cancer patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ag@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with lack of patients with bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . an approval for the placing on A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is designed for the treatment of constant up to severe episodes of bi@@ polar episodes and for prevention of a new man@@ ian episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ian episodes and their man@@ ian episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day in a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness with doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
with view to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor consists of combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ preme behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , an increased cross @-@ risk cancer with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol gave comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are applied for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , Hyp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive phar@@ maceuticals ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute mal@@ ign@@ ant and mal@@ ign@@ ant shape ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that were a year or less , there were occas@@ i@@ onal reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
if using an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis should occur , the dose should reduce or break the dose .
if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ n , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica must be set up , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with cra@@ amp@@ ite cases in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in condition that are to be used with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis , patients who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an increased death rate compared to placebo .
there were however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the talk for un@@ desirable events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia in some cases are extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ el or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em com@@ a or death , was treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no accurate risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ desirable events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients treated with the direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ phen@@ ation , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of happiness values .
a weight gain is generally known for schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to Com@@ or@@ bid@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , in which weight gain is known as a tri@@ bution , and could lead to severe complic@@ ations .
because of the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nerv@@ ous system is careful if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is not taken in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alized medicines with side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist is Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a Mag@@ en@@ ic blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to be that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects have , and therefore similar dos@@ is@@ re@@ reductions should be made .
with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the joint application can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
if you prefer the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should over@@ take potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ectors , should have similar effects and therefore should similar dos@@ is@@ re@@ reductions .
after pressing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a constant increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol per day no significant effect on the met@@ abolic rate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ology ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
people should be recommended to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ adequate data protection regarding human beings and due to the re@@ productive studies during the re@@ productive studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is justified for the F@@ öt@@ us .
as yet with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica the patients should be war@@ ned , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
the number of adverse events listed below are defined in accordance with the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ onie and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was conducted in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ tic therapy .
Man@@ ical episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was conducted in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term planning , over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ em@@ ulation controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and c@@ pt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurr@@ ence with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ degenerative syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute survi@@ vor@@ s with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no death sequence .
there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; however , it is un@@ likely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose is because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma connection .
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , for alpha @-@ 1 ad@@ ore and to the Hist@@ amine H1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily , the Pos@@ it@@ alian Emission Emission Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor @-@ lig@@ or , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the tur@@ key .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study was 52 % of the response of response to study medication , similar to study medication which were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ enger , defined as secondary degree programmes , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression scale showed significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patient with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ o @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia more than 26 weeks , the 314 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a more flexible dosage of 3 weeks with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an increase in placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior efficiency compared to placebo .
in two plac@@ eb@@ o- and active mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an impact effect compared to placebo that was comparable with lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also proved a similar proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic remission of man@@ ie on like Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial more than 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic surgery , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of man@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension of more than 74 weeks , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a remission compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly when prevention of a bi@@ polar response .
based on in vitro studies , the enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion and hydro@@ xy@@ re@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the N @-@ De@@ alk@@ yl@@ ation is offset by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cataly@@ st .
the medium elim@@ ination of elim@@ ination cycles is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol at an extensive met@@ abolic type of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) met@@ abolic syndrome via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic investigation of patients no sexually dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics revealed no indication of clinical significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or the impact of the space on the phar@@ maceuticals of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study on subjects with different grave liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and de@@ hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to pull them on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies to safety charges , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ gens potential , the pre@@ clinical data left no particular d@@ angers to men .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with doses or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects found a dos@@ per@@ taining side effects ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigments ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people ) and an increase of side @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma / car@@ cin@@ oma during female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the reduction of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys to repeated oral care ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the number of adverse events listed below are defined in accordance with the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral consent to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was conducted in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term planning , over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ em@@ ulation controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ances of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and c@@ pt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurr@@ ence with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ degenerative syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behaviour disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time trial ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement of symptoms in comparison with placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement of the initial improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement is 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analysis of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar effectiveness in relation to total population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) in comparison to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study was 52 % of the response of response to study medication , similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ enger , defined as a secondary degree programmes , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ o @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia more than 26 weeks , the 314 patients ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evaluation cases ) was significantly less patients with a minimum weight of 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior effectiveness in retinal symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial more than 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week studio study , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a remission compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly when prevention of a bi@@ polar response .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % greater the AU@@ C after the gift of the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two formulation .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers were the medium time until reaching the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after use .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment in an system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum of human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies for re@@ productive diagnostic tox@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety concerns pursuant to matern@@ al exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) was over the maximum of human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for security sp@@ har@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ gens potential , the pre@@ clinical data left no particular d@@ angers to men .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with doses or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects found a dos@@ ages @-@ dependent tri@@ chlor@@ ophyll ( AU@@ C ) according to 104 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3- to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for people at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the medium ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the reduction of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys to repeated oral care ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study on the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had received a anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce the side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ phar@@ maceuticals .
only the patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the disease and survival in terms of disease and survival .
however , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ phar@@ maceuticals .
it also may not be applied to patients who have a silent or prior to the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ numbers in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) posed that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane contained in patients where the first treatment is not more effective , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included drugs not to reduce any side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company Ab@@ ra@@ xis Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited for placing the placing of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and not shown for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sens@@ or@@ ical Neurop@@ ath@@ y Grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted by a better level of 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles must be reduced the dose .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to exc@@ essive impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4th and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data to un@@ imagin@@ ative and effectiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ating of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could be much more phar@@ maceuticals than other formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be derived immediately and the patient may not be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patient , there should be no further down@@ ra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles , up to the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation count again increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with ra@@ x@@ ane .
while one was not proven in connection with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in connection , cardi@@ ac disease were not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ emet@@ ika and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ic funds .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant or women in the common age that does not have an effective conception , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ handy .
women in the booked age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane a reliable activation method .
male patients who are treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is enrich@@ ed , during and up to six months after the treatment is not a child .
male patients should be advised before the treatment over a sperm con@@ gest@@ ation , because the treatment with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane may cause adverse events such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can work on the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
following these are the most frequent and most important events of adverse events listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ si@@ bly and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ie was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the side effects listed in connection with the gift of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .

Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ fluid 1 The frequency of over@@ sensitive actions is calculated based on a defin@@ itive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and it was not established with these events .
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active ingredient which promotes the combination of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tu@@ b@@ aller@@ ules and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing of their depor@@ ol@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ ba convey@@ s in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the frame of in @-@ vitro studies was demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is encour@@ aging through the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ endo@@ thel@@ ial transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ comp@@ or is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ umen Prot@@ ected SP@@ ARC ( sp@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the Tum@@ ors .
the application of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two un@@ riv@@ alled clinical trials and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III clinical study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as In@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received 3 weeks of mon@@ otherapy with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 in form of solvent containing allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 minutes in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of Met@@ ast@@ as@@ ation and 19 % for Met@@ ast@@ as@@ ation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 Results for general response time and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y Grade 3 during the therapy .
the natural development of peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y on Bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of the overall P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el according to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute infusion from Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the molecular exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous gift of abor@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma increased in multi@@ phase mode .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide range of ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ular distribution and / or female binding of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced tum@@ ors with advanced tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical characteristics of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ously 30 @-@ minute injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ quality P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the cle@@ aring of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) as after a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of the human liver micro@@ some and tissue samples reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is ab@@ oli@@ zed in first line to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ abolic ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute index of 260 mg / m2 ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ine was less than 1 % of the specified value 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance .
however , over the age of more than 75 years , only a few data available , because only 3 patients of this age group took part in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light protected by 8 hours .

for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of these disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip structures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently been a hil@@ ly correction ; the number of fra@@ c@@ tures was investigated over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) for six months .
main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness of the efficacy of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( a enzyme that builds bone structure ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ed@@ itary structures in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ dives ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of rolling structures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with ke@@ epers , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the infusion and are often less frequently .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may not be applied to patients who may possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ata or other components .
as in all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney failure , reactions to the Inf@@ usi@@ ble station and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die from bone tissue ) in a pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who explains how to apply any side effects of medication , and should be noted when they should consult the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic envelop@@ es , the administration of the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the ke@@ epers ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long R@@ emis@@ si@@ onal period was observed in patients who have addressed to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , for at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently cut low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ ch , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. oral or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ ine vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion .
the incidence of symptoms who occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended because of limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients similar to younger .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , because data is missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because this patient &apos;s population has only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a before the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a due to treat calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the fast installation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid to the bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , for at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cork @-@ ero@@ ids , bad mouth hygiene should be applied to a dent@@ ure of bis@@ phosph@@ ates with reasonable dental treatment .
for patients who require dental handles , no data are available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates will reduce the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in a pine field .
the clinical assessment should be based on the treatment plan for each patient and are based on an individual value @-@ risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms who occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported by pre@@ hop@@ eful cases was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 % of 3.@@ 852 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ gent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was comparable to the tot@@ ality difference between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2,6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .

ren@@ al impair@@ ment of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was expressed as a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ ine cle@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a limited kidney function was similar in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory , the temporary calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients .
all patients received adequate quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical freight structures according to a hil@@ ly fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical freight structures , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the Inf@@ usi@@ ble station , such as tube , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in a pine area , especially with cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in a pine ) reports that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs for local infections , including oste@@ opath@@ ic infections , and the majority of the reports rel@@ ates to respect to Zah@@ nex@@ tra@@ ctions or other dental forms .

a micro@@ computer@@ ized tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the receipt of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture in comparison to placebo .
bone sales mark@@ er The bones @-@ specific alkal@@ inity of the type @-@ I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups from 517 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before the infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total th@@ orn and scra@@ per .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment resulted in more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total assets and 4.3 % at the shr@@ ink@@ age .
clinical efficacy in males In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study were random@@ ized 508 men , and 185 patients were evaluated by the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the prevalence of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures was 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage of alli@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in comparison to the percentage of the l@@ um@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .

11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg cra@@ ck@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
after 6 months , a similar acceptance of pain and pain reduction was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a response at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( on the therapy ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , compared with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usi@@ ons of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
then the plasma tor@@ ches rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney disorder up to 35 ml / min do not require any dose adjustment of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
as for heavy kidney disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are not possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ defined intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .
sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered by 0,6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to approximately 6@@ fold of human therapeutic exposure to which corresponds to 7@@ fold of human therapeutic exposure to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European opening report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains , as the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , discussed in order to evaluate recommendations concerning the application of the pharmaceutical .
Ac@@ tos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ ic drug is not displayed ) . • It can be used together with another diabet@@ ic drug ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in alone cannot be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose can be retained , except for patients with h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) , except patients with h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or the ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin is better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar level drops , thus reducing type 2 diabetes .
for more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy was examined ; patients received a combination of metal form@@ in with a sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ har@@ p , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for 3.5 years .
in studies the concentration of a substance was measured in blood ( gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos resulted in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which ensures that the blood sugar values were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ a study , the effect of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ har@@ p in a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin at 289 patients were examined , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin received a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respiratory paths ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity compared to maturity ) .
Ac@@ tos may neither be applied to patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) versus Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ a ( high k@@ ill@@ ary mirror - acidity level - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos is to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with Met@@ form@@ in in patients .
October 2000 , the European Commission adopted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited an approval for placing cars in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to white , round , curved and carry on one side the inscription &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient and especially suitable for contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who have at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure should start to increase treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or eyel@@ ids are observed , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oil can be observed when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular study conducted with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ al disease has been carried out .
in this study , an increase of reports about heart failure , which led to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of a liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ i may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area are increased , the liver enz@@ ym@@ es are returned as soon as possible .
if a patient is designed to prove on a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , out@@ shell , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ es to check .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on continued to be led until they are led to the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a dos@@ ages weight increase , which can stir up of fat deposits and connected in some cases with a liquid .
as a result of a hem@@ at@@ ution , a lower reduction in the medium @-@ optic ner@@ ve values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one for patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ t@@ its around 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lower extent even in patients under sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ har@@ dening and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ ha@@ y@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity , patients who received pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as a bi @-@ phase or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin therapy , the risk of a dos@@ is@@ dependent Hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
following the market launch , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , including an appearance or deteri@@ oration of a diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular hole reported using a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether it gives a direct link between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ op@@ men , but ver@@ aging doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular cases when patients should report on interference above disorders of visual acuity .
in a summar@@ ised analysis of messages un@@ wanted events of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence amounted to 1.9 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ an treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) were treated with a comparative medication .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient has a pregnancy or if it occurs , the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ i does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enz@@ ym@@ es , e.g. or@@ ale contra@@ diction , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ naked and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ as@@ par@@ mer are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with the fibro@@ sis Council ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is primarily attributable to treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent , thereby reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the fat growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not rated from this data is not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the Bre@@ ch@@ oral complex of the lens , as they are also observed in other h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ph@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents joined the tri@@ fold of the upper limit as below placebo , however more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ har@@ p .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ al disease was the incidence of a serious heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rarely has been reported using heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on had been used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
there was a summar@@ ised analysis of messages un@@ wanted events regarding bone brood , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative study groups .
in the over a period of 3,5 years , Fra@@ c@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ an treated patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
at taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did no symptoms occur .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work via a activation specific kernel of re@@ pt@@ or γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver - , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on glu@@ ed the Glu@@ cos@@ y production in the liver and increases peripheral Glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ s in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy has been carried out over two years to investigate the time by the therapeutic effectiveness ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was defined by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was adjusted despite three im@@ on@@ ati@@ ger optim@@ isation , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value around 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who received only ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin at Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ an treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on group .
in clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ eries compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was checked in a small one , on 18 weeks for analysis of type 2 diabet@@ ics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol and slightly significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to placebo , Met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ fied and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo was not statistically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d reduced values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was not only the so@@ ber tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved also the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , which includes both an effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d absorption and also on the h@@ ep@@ ic tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular therapy , either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .

after or@@ aler application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the thread ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elim@@ ination of plasma @-@ elim@@ ination of pure Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active met@@ abolic rate is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abolic strings are lower than in healthy subjects with limited kidney function , whereby the rates of oral cle@@ ance of the parent is similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , pursuant to repeated administration of plasma tor@@ ment , an@@ emia and reversible ex@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac disease .
this is primarily attributable to treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent , thereby reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the fat growth .

in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ ke which indicates that the blood sugar level were similar strongly like with another human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may also over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted , when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can work on blood sugar ( the full list is to be found ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was transferred to the risks of diabetes in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S permit an approval of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be applied to patients suffering from ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d must be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can work on blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S permit an approval to the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin is mixed , first the amount of the ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin must then be removed , then the amount of the long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin .
3 If changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d during patients a dose adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary during the first dosage or months after conversion .
prior to travel , which should go over several time zones , the patient should bring it to the advice of his physician , as such journeys may be applied , ins@@ ulin and meals are applied to other times respectively .
5 General conditions and complaints on the appoint@@ ments opportunities - local over@@ sensitive skin reaction on the inj@@ ections during the ins@@ ulin therapy , local over@@ sensitive actions ( tube , sw@@ elling , ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection station ) occur .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 diabet@@ ic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabet@@ ic patients showed that one through intraven@@ ously designated Ac@@ tu@@ glyc@@ emia ( blood sugar 4,4 - 6.1 m@@ mol / l ) reduced the mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within a half hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and young people The pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was investigated at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabet@@ ic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years old ) and youth ( aged between the ages of 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , however , however , accept@@ ing the assum@@ ption that the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic profile in children and teenagers is similar to adults .

if the ur@@ inary acid is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ or , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , it is still possible to occur in the first six months of treatment in the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for prevention of plaster .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , on the 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to placebo ( a different drug to treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid was below 6 mg / dl in the blood of the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg total income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once per day were 120 mg of patients suffering from the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no one of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , in patients with heart failure in the pre @-@ history , perhaps an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the conclusion for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of the ur@@ inary year as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of adverse events in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed that statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid content to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the physician attendance in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney failure The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney failure ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary host point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of the process of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney failure ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had to study a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years collected data from the open renewal study of Phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients were required in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required a treatment against a tox@@ ication ) .
this was associated with a reduction of plaster size , which was 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of plaster notes up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ic@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
for healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the plasma concentration time ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ic@@ ost@@ at after administration is easier and multi@@ pler doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise of AU@@ C is observed , which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes in the percentage of decline in serum concentration was observed , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ s@@ s / F ) of Feb@@ ic@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ m@@ ap@@ rot@@ ein connection of Feb@@ ic@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binder on Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration width which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies with human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes showed that these oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ye@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly arises due to U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ eted Feb@@ ic@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in ur@@ ine as un@@ altered Feb@@ ic@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 13 % ) as well as further unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the differentiation of the ur@@ ine , approximately 45 % of the dose were found in the chair as un@@ altered Feb@@ ic@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 25 % ) as well as further unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , medium or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ic@@ ost@@ at not changed in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ic@@ ost@@ at increased by about the 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 m g / h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13,@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney disease .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one illness , in which the bones are incub@@ ated ) for women after the men@@ op@@ ause , in which a risk of low vitamin D mirrors are used .
the patient must take one tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before meal , drink or immig@@ rants ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) .
in order to avoid a matur@@ ation of the feeding tube , the patient may not take place until after the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not go .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D mirrors .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than in those who use only Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on revenues ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bone or joints ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( digest@@ ive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( ul@@ gence ) , si@@ p@@ ation ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) , si@@ sts ( infl@@ ated belly ) , and Sau@@ res .
in patients with any more sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied .
it must not be applied in cases of the feeding tube , in patients with Hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients who can not stand upright or sit at least 30 minutes .

capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ ant ) for the day .
the following references are exactly to be sure to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated adverse events ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , the patients should not be cr@@ ushed or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ept@@ ical Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal bleeding or surgical inter@@ ventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ ic , only given special attention ( see section 4.3 ) .

3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients who take the medicine not correct and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that indicate a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions may be transferred to the patient and agree to the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after introduction ) Mag@@ ical and du@@ b@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , some heavier and associated complic@@ ations , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the p@@ ines , usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported primarily intraven@@ ously administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously .
there are no data available to indicate whether the abor@@ ate of a bis@@ phosph@@ at@@ at@@ ry in patients who require a military surgical procedure , reduces risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the p@@ ines .
clinical assessment due to the treated physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning in each patient on basis of individual use @-@ risk assessment .
the patients should be noted that they should be taking the dosage of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their s@@ iting .
they are supposed to take no two tablets on the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases resulting from the mineral change ( like vitamin D deficiency and Hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oid ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .

therefore , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes before taking any medication ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together with a variety of commonly @-@ driven drugs , without that clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions occurred .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither advis@@ ing women during pregnancy .

furthermore , the results of a clinical study enrolled 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of C@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
main inde@@ b@@ ator of the effectiveness was the number of patients who was tuned after a year after treatment duration of a year ( as often as often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a re @-@ recording of the di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
in addition , more recent studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined , as C@@ agra@@ f is recorded in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

patients and doctors have to be careful if others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs can be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , since the Adv@@ oc@@ f dose or the dose of the same medication must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immune stimul@@ ant therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t@@ ation@@ es should be able to arrange this medication or changes in the immune stimul@@ ant therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ t or to an increased incidence of adverse events , including under@@ - or overweight .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or reg@@ imes should only be made under the close control of one in the transplan@@ tation control ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a sequence of change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of C@@ agra@@ f should be based on clinical assessment of ab@@ out@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in individual and on blood level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after migration from Pro@@ gra@@ f on C@@ agra@@ f you should be controlled by the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror in front of the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure was measured as Tal@@ mirror , with both for@@ b@@ ays both in kidney stones and similar patients .
careful and re @-@ repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate im@@ pregn@@ ation phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ ance , a adaptation of the C@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s state does not allowed any oral intake of medication , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion solution ) can be derived with a dose of approx .
duration of the application In the suppression of transplan@@ t , the immun@@ os@@ ges must be observed ; a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation of the gra@@ ft canc@@ els The or@@ ale Adv@@ oc@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustment may be necessary later , as the phar@@ yn@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ ization of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the gra@@ ft test treatment should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ oc@@ f must be converted into a daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a transition from other Immun@@ os@@ kel@@ si@@ va on C@@ agra@@ f once daily must begin treatment with the recommended initial initial dose for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ t .
corne@@ al transplan@@ tation At adult patients who are applied on C@@ agra@@ f is a oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning .
other transplan@@ t receivers Al@@ though there are no clinical experience with C@@ agra@@ f in lung , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ al transplan@@ ted patients at an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intest@@ inal transplan@@ t patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustment in special patient groups with reduced liver function For maintaining blood mirror in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Da ren@@ al function does not exercise influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may not be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum samples , a calculation of the at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on C@@ agra@@ f At the change@@ over of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - based on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the bottom level in the thorough@@ bred The dose should be based on clinical assessment of ab@@ out@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in individual cases under assignment of whole blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ king controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood flow levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f on C@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adjustment , changes to immune stimul@@ ant therapy or in simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since C@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low cle@@ ance , the dose of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady State entered .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the Tal@@ king level should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ t in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of heart transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent detection of liver - , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tations were used as a rule of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
it has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t im@@ pulse or other side effects , which may occur in a consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or reg@@ imes should only be made under the close control of one in the transplan@@ tation control ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft , which proved to be proven against other Immun@@ os@@ kel@@ si@@ va as a therapy , there are currently no clinical data for the ret@@ aining formulation of C@@ agra@@ f .
to the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions in adult heart transplan@@ t and transplan@@ ts are currently no clinical data for the ret@@ aining formulation of C@@ agra@@ f .
due to potential inter@@ actions , which can lead to a decrease of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the La@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) , or other plant protection during a treatment with C@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ blood mirror can be subjected to such circumstances .
in rare cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f was described as a car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ t@@ rophy , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces , a treatment with cork ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , liquid loading and furn@@ aces .
as with other Immun@@ os@@ kel@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of skin by suitable clothing or use of solar control by using a high protection factor .
if patients who take the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of P@@ res such as head@@ ache , changing consciousness and visual disorders should show a radical study ( e.@@ g ) .
since we included hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ert , l@@ act@@ ose who is included in patients with the rare for@@ war@@ der Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , L@@ act@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absorption special care .
the simultaneous application of medicines or plant heal@@ ers , known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore advis@@ able to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood mirror at the same time of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining equal effects ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong inter@@ changeable effect was made with an@@ em@@ yk@@ ot@@ ica such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid anti@@ bi@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ ectors .
phar@@ yn@@ inet@@ ics studies , that the increase of blood mirror mainly from the increased biological availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal deteri@@ oration .

since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid @-@ contra@@ sting and to increase the hormone level , it is particularly careful with decisions concerning receiving measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will reduce the cle@@ aring of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of examinations on transplan@@ t@@ ation@@ ships have no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other Immun@@ os@@ kel@@ si@@ va an increased risk for un@@ wanted events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy .

methods to spring detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and C@@ MV infections , bone mark@@ im@@ umab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , lead to valley mirror between 10 and 15 ng / ml , and recent transplan@@ tation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ ric value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ restricted faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or caused by treatment with cork @-@ ero@@ ids are responsible for determining the higher cle@@ aring rates after transplan@@ tation .

Adv@@ ates is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( a lack of factor VIII conditional , con@@ genital blood disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application may be addressed whether they are applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedure .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cells like bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method described as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human Ger@@ inn@@ acle factor VIII .
in one another in the European Union approved medic@@ ations called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , however , it is similar , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ant@@ ages was awarded in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ates ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII .
in patients may not be applied to patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against the human Ger@@ inn@@ ment factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein , or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG an approval for the placing of the European Union in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the substr@@ ate therapy are addressed according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII of VIII , after the place and the magnitude of blood and the clinical state of patients .
the following path@@ o@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events should not fall by the factor VIII activity in the respective period under the specified plasma level ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and the acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is passed by the risk .
during treatment , it is enrich@@ ed to the control of the administered dose and frequency of inj@@ ections a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma bricks .
individual patients can distingu@@ ish in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different sem@@ esters .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be reached or if the blood of blood is not dominated by an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out if necessary for inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures will need to be observed .
the delivery speed should be addressed according to the patients , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine who are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days will depend on the largest and of genetic and other factors .
with pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ ne@@ c@@ et@@ ting @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re@@ mot@@ ely observed ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare im@@ aging of hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and nurs@@ ing .
the A@@ DR@@ s patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were treated in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for education of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculations ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE infusion .
during the whole period , blood cl@@ ung was stopped during the period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed adequate values on the 15 . postoperative day .
for clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed a low In@@ hibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , no more than 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnostic patients with an age of 6 years and diagnostic hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was determined by the previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients to factor VIII .
the immun@@ ity of patients on traces of cont@@ amin@@ ating proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the anti @-@ antibodies against this proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a continued peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell . however , no signs or symptoms occur in an allergic reaction or an over@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , on the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ ul@@ oc@@ ytes in several repeated product texts within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported by allergic reactions from allergic type , including an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic / an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII acts as a c@@ of@@ ak@@ tor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all phar@@ yn@@ inet@@ ics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were treated with severe or moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the approval of available data , the CH@@ MP has continued to benefit the benefit risk compensation as positive , but in fact that the safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has been based on the basis of security fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation has to apply a further renewal procedure for 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited issued the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company will permit its application for placing on approval for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the wheat parts ( tissue , connects the other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and support ) .
this is a kind of virus that genet@@ ically modified genet@@ ically that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which was so significant that there was no copies of themselves and thus cannot solve the infections of humans .
C@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from which non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body is made of a p@@ 53 @-@ gene , usually it is usually to be damaged DNA and kill cells when the DNA can not be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can grow further and share themselves .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient in front of the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ structures in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP answers the company &apos;s answers to the questions , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the exam of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP has created a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP view , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors are advant@@ age@@ ous for the patients .
the Committee had further concerns regarding the processing of medicines in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of medicines .
in addition , the company had not been sufficient that we can be manufactured in reliable way that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient is harmful .
the CH@@ MP has not been in knowledge whether the response consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ant@@ in .
&quot; changed active ingredients , &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the most effective ingredients are immediately released and the other slowly is released over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic Rhin@@ itis ( loc@@ ust@@ ra@@ des , caused by an allerg@@ y against poll@@ en mut@@ ation of the nose ) in patients with Nas@@ en@@ mu@@ cos@@ a sw@@ elling ( clo@@ ak nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( ab@@ op@@ aque nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the major effective dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the loc@@ ust@@ up@@ f@@ ens@@ iti@@ que , which were reported in the treatment before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study patients the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , such as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the loc@@ alization of the nose reported the patients who reported aer@@ obic revenues , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.9 % in patients receiving P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the Nas@@ en@@ mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed an lin@@ king of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , mou@@ th@@ iness , sw@@ ing@@ ness , psych@@ ologists ( appet@@ ite ) , angi@@ oplast@@ y , fatigue , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nia ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep mode ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , or one of the other components , against ad@@ r@@ ener@@ ge agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different medicines for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who suffer from a bott@@ angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( hyper@@ tension of thy@@ ro@@ id ) , or already have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( hyper@@ tension caused by a brain disease ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company SP Europe for placing aer@@ ating aer@@ obic plant in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to break , break or cut down ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data to un@@ certainty and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is so short as possible and should not be continued after closing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time on 10 days , as long as long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with time .
after decline of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , the medicine is also treated with patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined use of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as Bro@@ mo@@ th@@ ot@@ amin or other Dek@@ on@@ ger@@ va , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ ek , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ ek , Eph@@ ed@@ rin , Oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient &apos;s patients and not enough to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage .
safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver problems and the data is not sufficient to discuss corresponding recommendations to the dosage .
patients must be informed that the treatment at the age of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ at or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or et@@ w@@ ai@@ gen other neu@@ rolo@@ gic symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ ache ) must be set .
in the treatment of the following patients age groups : • patients under D@@ IG@@ IT@@ AL@@ IS • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before the execution of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as Anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ ika otherwise prevent positive reactions to prevent skin reaction or in their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was given in addition , there were no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
in the results of the psychological tests , no significant differences could be detected between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and treated with placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
this was not identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medic@@ inal CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the un@@ imagin@@ ative of the application of aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ ical characteristics of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied that it can occur in very rare cases , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ versi@@ fied spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , heart @-@ cycle coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ mor , Constitu@@ tions ) with possible cl@@ auses .

a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation is particularly likely to children , as well as At@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ dr@@ on , tur@@ qu@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and di@@ lem@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human body cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ess of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no effect on standard measuring sizes including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective , or the tasks that are connected to flying .
in clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of 5 mg daily , compared to placebo compared to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can give more sympath@@ om@@ im@@ et@@ ical effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS detection .
there were 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic Rhin@@ itis , where 414 patients were aer@@ obic tablets received .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ aze tablets , determined based on the overall scores for sympt@@ om@@ atic ( except Nas@@ en@@ mu@@ ger@@ mination ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin via the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ obic tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined based on the nostr@@ ils , was significantly higher than in a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ obic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study to phar@@ yn@@ inet@@ ics of aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is veri@@ fi@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the Peru@@ vian application of aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ist multi@@ dos@@ is@@ study , which was conducted using the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult patients was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin bad@@ ly di@@ ver@@ ts .
a components @-@ interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin after the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an aer@@ obic tablet .
based on conventional studies to security sp@@ har@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , to gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive diagnosis , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin however no particular d@@ angers for people recognize .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the effects observed were generally related to the content of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in re@@ productive sto@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was not ter@@ at@@ ched in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 the application of the authorisation described by Pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ anz@@ ler has been established and works , before and while the product is on the market .

it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ ate to insert ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting tablet tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and than 0.5 mg / ml solution for inser@@ ting .
for children ages one to five years the dose is 1.25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or bz@@ w .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or bz@@ w .
A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic Rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms of symptoms ( Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body makes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tray in the same way as tablets and application in children are un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
in allergic Rhin@@ itis , the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of sympt@@ om ( sympt@@ om points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo was treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin , or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company SP Europe , an approval for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to prevent symptoms of allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials for the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ eries in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the disease of disease and can be terminated after the sever@@ ity of symptoms and will be resum@@ ed .
with persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patients can be recommended to treat a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets not detected , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol have been given additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ maceuticals study was not strengthened by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) in a clinical @-@ phar@@ yn@@ ological study ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in fact that in very rare cases it can result in very rare cases , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of transport or ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic Rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that was reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , oral dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was treated with 5.9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( ninth clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human body cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ess of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ maceuticals study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was given over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals was revealed .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no effect on standard measuring sizes including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective , or the tasks that are connected to flying .
in patients with allergic Rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the line of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , tr@@ ams and tubes of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic Rhin@@ itis can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis is defined as a result of symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as from the total score of fra@@ ct@@ ance at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively induced A@@ eri@@ us effectively caused by seasonal allergic Rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was also examined for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the under@@ lying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology is im@@ aging with different forms similar to the different forms and chronic patients .
since the hist@@ amin@@ ant is expected to achieve a real factor of all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ ine diseases , besides chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also in other forms of the ur@@ tik@@ aria lead to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the upgrade of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the size of Qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic , the minority was re@@ acted out of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine .
improvement of the jew@@ ellery by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax significantly , as through a 4 @-@ point scale to review this variables was measured .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics study , similar to the patients @-@ demo@@ s with the general seasonal allergic Rhin@@ itis population , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no application points for a clinical @-@ relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
this was not identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medic@@ inal CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ is@@ ic study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin with a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fat , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) is not limited to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin conducted pre@@ clinical studies , with a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , and of Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on conventional studies to safety charges , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive diagnosis , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not recognize any special haz@@ ards for people .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to prevent symptoms of allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the doctor may be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis could be caused by infection under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are pre@@ valent to support the treatment of an inf@@ ectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory diseases or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin examination .
about 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years met@@ abolic Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin restricted and experienced a higher substr@@ ate load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years old , limited met@@ abolic , is identical with the children who ab@@ oli@@ zes normal .
this medication contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inher@@ ited problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absor@@ p@@ ation or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ iciency cannot take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol have been given additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ maceuticals study was not ampli@@ fied by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the most powerful effects of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the tot@@ ality of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic Rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ dose study on adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who arrived for an anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ otherapy in question received daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years old ) .
because the course of allergic Rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin with adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine can be extra@@ pol@@ ated with adults on the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple outlets in adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ maceuticals study on adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sl@@ ashes compared to placebo .
during a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets produced in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ ologist .
in clin@@ ically @-@ phar@@ maceuticals studies in adults , there came neither to an increase of alcohol dependent of alcohol dependent on alcohol dependent of alcohol induced power .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic Rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the line of symptoms such as ni@@ es , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , tr@@ ams and tubes of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
as from the total score of fra@@ ct@@ ance at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively has been reduced by seasonal allergic Rhin@@ itis
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the upgrade of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the size of Qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
dis@@ sem@@ ination of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otyp@@ s was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic parameters were obtained in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic majority @-@ dose study with the si@@ der@@ form@@ ulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic Rhin@@ itis .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time span of approximately 120 hours .
there are no application points for a clinical @-@ relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days for adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin with pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were similar to those recommended doses with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
this was not identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzyme , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown cylinders with child @-@ safe polypropylene cone cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application injection for filling with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ ate to take daily in the mouth , to prevent symptoms of allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ ats must be taken away without dam@@ aging them .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol have been used additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic Rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients who were treated with placebo .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially approved the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will propose its application to approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of avi@@ aries H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza which is caused by the trunk ( Type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which may cause a tribe of influenza which could cause a future pan@@ demic .
an influenza pan@@ demic breaks out if a new trunk of influenza is di@@ spar@@ ed , who can spread slightly from humans , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the parts of the influenza , as &quot; body strange &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system later is able to form a quick antibody in contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus .
afterwards the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es surface that det@@ ects human body as body strange ) are cleaned , cleaned and used as a component of vacc@@ ination .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient to fulfil the requirements of the vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ination , to fulfil the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for preventive vacc@@ ines .
if you want to participate in a clinical study and need further information about your treatment , please contact your treatment doctor .

it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules as a solution for inser@@ ting the capsules , but this can not be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gen@@ ase should then be classified , if the doctor has checked , who previously taken an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of the virus may be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , together with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is aimed at body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase reduces HIV @-@ amount in blood in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS cannot heal AIDS , however , however , the damage of the immune system and the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which were not treated with prot@@ ectors .
this was compared with low endo@@ thel@@ ial R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who compared with other prot@@ ectors .
major inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in blood ( vir@@ al load ) or the change of vir@@ al load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had not taken any protein after 48 weeks , more patients had a vir@@ al load below 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective as In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ al load , with but of the children who were previously treated with prot@@ ectors , only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who have been treated with prot@@ ectors were treated with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced phar@@ maceuticals A@@ gen@@ ase the vir@@ al load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ectors .
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ectors , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger decrease of vir@@ al load after four weeks as in the patient receiving their previous proteins .
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied to patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medic@@ inal products that are being min@@ ed as A@@ gen@@ ase are taken into high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other drugs against HIV , the aging of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or a immune activation ( symptoms of an infection that caused by the immune system ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 in@@ treated adults and children over four years compared to risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee presented that the benefit of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not taken no prot@@ ectors .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , because at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
October 2000 , the European Commission announced the Gla@@ xo Group Limited an approval to the placing of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is available in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- , prot@@ eas@@ iness ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children 4 years of age .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be administered by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should be made under consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution for insertion is 14 % lower than by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ ting a milli@@ gram per milli@@ grams of base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 When A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the phar@@ maceuticals , efficacy and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ectors were not investigated by children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data to un@@ imagin@@ ative and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic data , the dose to A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction on 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or exc@@ essive liver interference with respect to patients with severe liver problems it is con@@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) may not be applied due to the risk of reducing plasma concentrations , and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy did not lead to a healing of HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complic@@ ations of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase does not prevent the risk of a transfer of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have an increased risk for heavy liver side effects with potentially fatal development .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this drug .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic hepatitis , showed an increased frequency of liver problems under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ or@@ tic oids , which is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment of the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ost@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the side shift function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the se@@ wage of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ tus Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ y including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some drugs which may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standardis@@ ation ratio ) , methods for determination of active concentration .
in patients who use these medicines at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective for reduced plasma welding of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ diction can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
when Meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patient should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ eous hum@@ pt@@ omas , especially if there are even low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of a tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ actic acid content of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is valid for children under an age of four years and should be applied to be careful with certain other patient groups .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a skin impact of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including protests , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia was reported on diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines that were associated with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with phar@@ maceuticals - dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated with met@@ abolic disorders .
in hem@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ectors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spont@@ aneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to the pt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ den@@ ial opportun@@ ist infections which leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial e@@ ology is accepted ( including application of corrosion @-@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , high body measure index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can not be used together with drugs , whose efficiency is mainly connected to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , which are primarily associated with pharmaceutical and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r caused by a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the lower plasma level by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects were observed at the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be abolished through the simultaneous application of plant preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) .
if a patient takes place at Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ al mirror and if possible , check the vir@@ al load and add the cur@@ rant .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ ight ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase , for C@@ max with 30 % , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which show the effectiveness and un@@ imagin@@ ative of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) were administered twice daily when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however it is not recommended that the effectiveness and un@@ imagin@@ ative of this combination is not known .
in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gen@@ ase are given at least one hour apart from ant@@ it@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gen@@ ase ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with e@@ ye@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended to use the exposure of both prot@@ ectors of the low @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ectors and existing limited data can be avoided that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may possibly lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din due to decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma bricks could be less effective .
if these medicines be applied together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be made , as an exact forecast the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ r@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ ber@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thus reaching a rise of adverse events .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is administered to a reduction of the dosage of rift in at least half of the recommended dose although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out , however , the plasma cutting of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg k@@ os@@ cope vi@@ r and 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 552 ) to 2,@@ 69@@ times a day without a simultaneous application of F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r once daily .
other medicines that are listed below , among them also substr@@ ates , shirts or induction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ gen@@ ase , may lead to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions that are connected to these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other Prot@@ ectors , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da are not taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , because it can come to Res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ vul@@ va that are known as a enz@@ ym@@ n ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can result in a lower part of the plasma level of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the serum levels of calcium @-@ se@@ al@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ di@@ pin , di@@ pin pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ b di@@ pin and am@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug .
the simultaneous use with A@@ gen@@ ase can increase their plasma concentrations , and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with side @-@ side effects including Hyp@@ ot@@ ters , visual acuity and prim@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the potential benefit from treatment of the risk of systematic corne@@ al ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose deteri@@ oration is greatly dependent of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to anticip@@ ate increases the plasma tor@@ ment in simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma controls of this H@@ MG Co@@ a Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opath@@ y , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
there is a frequency monitoring of therapeutic levels until stabil@@ ization of the mirror , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase must not be applied together with oral inv@@ aded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ abolic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ectors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 fold .
when Meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ eous hum@@ pt@@ omas , especially if there are even low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of its low distortion of historical compar@@ ability there is currently no recommendation to adapt to Am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose if Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time .
in simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral antibodies together with A@@ gen@@ ase , a increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardis@@ ation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ diction is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods to the recipi@@ ent is recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied only after careful removal of the possible us@@ ation for the mother in comparison to the possible risks of the fet@@ us .
in the milk de@@ activation , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r was over@@ thrown in the breast milk .
a re@@ productive study on male rats who was administered by the in@@ ni@@ st@@ ature in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding time Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r was given , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight during the nurs@@ ing time .
further development of the offspring including fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to the matern@@ al .
the im@@ aging of A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in adults and in children 4 years of clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment connected adverse events were slightly up to moderate , early and led to the treatment of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are in relation to the use of A@@ gen@@ ase or another simultaneously to use HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ectors does not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were util@@ ized by the examination in connection with the study medication , and with more than 1 % of patients were listed , and under the treatment of treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with HIV patients ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and non @-@ corrosive fat tissue , multiply intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ k@@ aler grease collection .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not treated individuals who have been treated with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was observed only one case ( bull &apos;s racks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study enrolled at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ ME patients under Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
skin irrit@@ ation were usually easy to moderate , ery@@ them@@ ed or ma@@ cular nature , with or without Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z and stood spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without that the treatment with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r had to be broken .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to the pt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ den@@ ial opportun@@ ist infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg A@@ gen@@ ase were observed twice daily together with low do@@ si@@ onal R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) to those who were observed under the tri@@ glyc@@ eride treatment and CP@@ K values used in patients who received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ onal R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is observed on the signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary measures necessary .

the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M at acute cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients with currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ile treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ectors only rarely observed .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ vi@@ r / 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , with prot@@ ectors of pre @-@ treated patients were enrolled in patients with four @-@ rolog@@ ical claims over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ectors of the mut@@ ation @-@ mut@@ ations on :
for gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests @-@ based analyses gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used for estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ect@@ ory ins@@ ist isolation isol@@ ates .

conclusions concerning relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation machines can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to tigh@@ ten the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data on the estim@@ ation of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
companies to distribute diagnostics resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used for interpretation of any resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistant to R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r stays generally preserved .
there are currently data available to cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ otypes for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ets ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
in reverse , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ectors of the ins@@ ist isol@@ ate isol@@ ate ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation .
early departure of an vers@@ ag@@ onal therapy is recommended to maintain a variety of mut@@ ations in the borders , which can impact on the following treatment .
the cover of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ analogue ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) or a standard of PI , mainly with lower R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with certain virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one another PI and at least one n@@ RT@@ I were included in the research study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis set the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group regarding the time adjusted average change of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ reduction of 0.4 log@@ ged copies / ml .
the cover of the efficacy of un@@ born A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution was administered twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was given no low do@@ si@@ onal R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ gen@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data should be considered during the treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre@@ treated children who are expected to be considered &quot; un@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase in bed .
after oral administration , the medium duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , for C@@ max , reduced by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) is un@@ affected by the dietary absorption , although the simultaneous food intake increases the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can close to a large distribution volume as well as a im@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from blood circulation into the t@@ issues .
this change leads to a decrease of the overall concentration of active in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which remains the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ bound Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing intervals during the met@@ ady @-@ State concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore the drugs that the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can display or in@@ hibit or a sub@@ stra@@ t of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which are given to be careful if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is made of 14 % less bi@@ otic available as from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gen@@ ase Solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a million@@ th basis .
also the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al disorder is likely to be low to the elim@@ ination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma influences that are comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily without a simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ op@@ ogen@@ icity with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats appeared in male animals h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ne h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ul@@ arly Aden@@ omas on human exposure to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8- ( rat ) , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ cellular Aden@@ omas and Car@@ cin@@ oma was still un@@ explained and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data on humans , both clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little evidence for accept@@ ing a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ iz@@ able tests , the bacterial @-@ lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome test results in human peripheral l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r was neither dirty nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase are monitored and detected .
previously , in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase , still after the end of treatment .
studies for tox@@ icity in young , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed both the control as well as with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mortality .

24 . if A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .

a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however it is not recommended that the effectiveness and un@@ imagin@@ ative of this combination is not known .
the treatment with e@@ ye@@ ir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended to use the exposure of both prot@@ ectors of the low @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers .
if these medicines be applied together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be made , as an exact forecast the effect of the combination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase is administered to a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ ber@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data .

the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M at acute blood cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
in reverse , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ectors of the ins@@ ist isol@@ ate isol@@ ate ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation .
based on these data , with PI pre @-@ treated children , the benefit of an unexpected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase are considered to be considered .
while the absolute concentration of unexpected Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing intervals during the met@@ ady @-@ State concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the range of C@@ max , s@@ s to C@@ min , s@@ s ..

the most common , as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of the applic@@ ants were a reaction on the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the adverse events that were identified by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
according to the test plan , this study shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three weeks of regular treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream often associated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ( 61 % ) , corrosion ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / Ab@@ ove ( 14 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , this study shows that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , it is frequent in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and to severe Sch@@ or@@ ate and short@@ age ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials to study the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of acute ac@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dentally unique intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was norm@@ alized in Hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , system@@ ic concentrations of the Alp@@ ha@@ inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were demonstrated after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of F@@ eig@@ ques during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior to placebo .
in 60 % of all patients suffering from I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients the skins were completely covered ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo in patients ( 95 % CI ) .
a full recovery could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared with 5 % of 161 patients treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :

Al@@ dar@@ a cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind @-@ controlled trials to children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 576 , placebo n = 313 ) .
in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks
a minimum system@@ ic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ac@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applying in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single bag ) and on the hands / poor ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study , which indicates a prolonged re@@ tention of medication in the skin .
data from the system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low on MC @-@ ill skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ac@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study to the replacement tox@@ icity of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG was significantly reduced , body weight and elevated mil@@ z weight ; also a four months study enrolled for the coin application revealed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice during three days a week not induced any tum@@ ors at the field of application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ually , is a risk for people due to the system@@ ic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors were treated in the group of mice , which was treated with the actual free cream , previously and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied ( allergic ) on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be announced every year all new information that may be known , check and this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who received the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission adopted G@@ enzyme Europe B.V. an approval to the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ ier cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .

the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ i treated patients can develop inf@@ usi@@ oned reactions , which are defined as any common side effects , which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also be monitored also eng@@ ined , and the infusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment , in which re@@ inv@@ ig@@ ating equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually established within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usi@@ oned reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience in the treatment of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption must be careful due to the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ ri@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of inf@@ usi@@ ble reactions .
in case of light or medium inf@@ usi@@ oned reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ ika and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate , in which the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single , heavy inf@@ usi@@ oned reaction , the infusion must be stopped , until the symptoms have been killed , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amin@@ ika and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be weak@@ ened .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain because a potential risk of an inter@@ ference with the intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data was exposed to new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , it is recommended to avoid during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials have been classified as inf@@ usi@@ an @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ desirable medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and of their extension during a total treatment duration of up to 4 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some cases with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory paths and lungs in the pre@@ history there were heavy reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , breathing and fac@@ ial ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted phar@@ maceuticals effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , during a phase 2 study with 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly heavier form and treatment duration up to 12 months , were reported in the table .
once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
within 3 months after the treatment of treatment , it was within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical version , with the most severe decrease in patients at a Ser@@ con@@ ical version ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ejaculation from the study ) were det@@ ectable in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies before , among them 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ con@@ ical version .
patients with missing up to low anti @-@ antibodies mirror , a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ der in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti @-@ antibodies reported a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal effect to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing the oral effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed to be affected by clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not occur in connection with the incidence of adverse drugs actions , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse drugs actions typically fell with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for enz@@ ym@@ es therapy is located in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ se of the ak@@ cum@@ ulated substr@@ ate and preventing a further accum@@ ulation sufficient recovery of enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ at@@ ric recept@@ ors .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of the patients were reported , the majority of patients from the medium phen@@ otype and only one patient proved the severe phenom@@ enal .
patients were recruited if they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recruited for a Open @-@ label extension study , where she received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ i @-@ treated patients compared to the placebo group , a improvement of lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table .
in the open renewal study , an improvement and / or exc@@ itement of this effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
the acceptance of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly significantly and the absolute lung volumes increased more proportional to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ in@@ hibition of treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was determined until the study remained constant .
regarding the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation , the clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute test test , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
there was a one @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study conducted mainly the safety and pharmaceutical inet@@ ics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were enrolled at the time of their recording into the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy duty form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four cases , the dosage for increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 was increased to 200 E / kg last 26 weeks .
in several patients a magnitude growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ score for these age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe contamination form , while older patients with severe contamination form only limited or no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study tests were carried out on the dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schem@@ es to the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be demonstrated in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medication is updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to those in older and less affected patients .

patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were treated at an average of 12.1 months compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,3 months , compared with 7,9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients were forced to attack cancer cells , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the company Hel@@ Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. an approval for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each feed bottle must be activated with 4,2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which yields a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is collected and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml . ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma except for overwhelming epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al Car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous infusion in a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion in a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ed@@ - infusion in the first day every 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bronze car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous infusion in a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
the reduction in frequency and sever@@ ance of skin reaction must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after the treatment of a cor@@ dial ero@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 cans of foli@@ c acid and intake must be continued during the entire period of therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ ry .
patients must also receive a in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B12 ( 1000 mcg ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third loading cycle .
in patients who received P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , it should be created before each gift a complete blood image , including differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose must be held under the attitude of blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of therapy cycles .
according to the recovery , the patients must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
patients non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 should develop ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient the value before treatment .
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when patients after 2 dose reductions or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , compared to patients aged 65 years an increased secondary cancer .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to sufficient data to un@@ imagin@@ ative and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dos@@ is@@ adjustments needed , which can go out for all patients recommended dose adjustment .
the data base for patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver coverage of &gt; corresponds to 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper picture value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ant values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( near liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ asis ) was not especially studied in studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone mark@@ er , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation count again has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dose for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ number , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was observed , if a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ treated patients , foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ act@@ tic measure for reducing tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ cle@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ onic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ orities ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are provided for treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed must be taking care of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients receiving these events , corresponding risk factors had such risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , with existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
in case of patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - collection in trans@@ cellular room a dra@@ stic of the ergonom@@ ics before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment will be considered .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , when this active ingredient was given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ed life di@@ chloride ( except yel@@ fi@@ e@@ ber , this vacc@@ ination is not recommended ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be referred to in front of the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted to collect advice regarding the sperm benefit .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ mon@@ lo@@ gistic ( ≥ 1.3 g / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid can result in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) with a result of an increase in adverse reactions .
therefore , be careful if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage can be applied .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ orities ( see section 4.4 ) .
as no data regarding the inter@@ act of interest as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the t@@ inn@@ acle status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral antibodies and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires a increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardis@@ ation ratio ) if the decision was made to treat patients with oral antibodies .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed with pregnant women , but as in an@@ gu@@ itars anti@@ met@@ ab@@ ites are expected to be severe birth defects in pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if it is absolutely equal and after careful removal of the useful for the mother and risk of risk for the F@@ öt@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be noted before the treatment course , consulting on the sperm cells .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ acted in the breast milk and un@@ wanted effects of un@@ wanted effects can not be excluded .

it is applied for overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
patients who use all@@ i and apply no weight loss after 12 weeks , should apply to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
these enz@@ ym@@ es shall not build this enz@@ ym@@ es , that they may not build some fats in food , which occurs in about one quarter of the food which occurs in the intest@@ ines .
in a third study all@@ i was compared with 391 other patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who were all@@ i 60 mg total , compared to an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 there was no loss of relevant weight loss for patients .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , Fl@@ atus ( winds ) with Stu@@ h@@ edges , fet@@ ch / o@@ ily chair , dis@@ sem@@ inal secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) , and soft chairs .
it cannot be applied to patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing gra@@ ft patients ) or with drugs such as War@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied to patients who suffer from a long @-@ term painter ( not enough nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to cholesterol ( a liver disease ) , and with pregnant or matern@@ al mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission announced the Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing an authorization of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indic@@ ative for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) should be inde@@ xed and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ thet@@ ical , fat @-@ induced diet .
all@@ i can not be applied to children and adolescents under 18 , because there are no sufficient data on the efficacy and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ate , it is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of dosage .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active substance or one of the other components • Equ@@ al Treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tion@@ yn@@ syndrome • cholesterol • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • In simultaneous treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral antibodies ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ rich individual meal or low @-@ rich nutrition .
as the weight reduction in diabetes with improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a drug against diabetes , before onset of therapy with all@@ i a physician or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabet@@ ics should be adjusted if necessary .
patients that are all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist questions whether the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures to prevent that in the case of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea possible failure to prevent the oral contra@@ diction ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interaction of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a decrease of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma tor@@ ques .
when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral antibodies in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values could be influenced ( internationally standardis@@ ed ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as the beta carot@@ enes were in the standard range .
however , the patient should be recommended to take a supplement of the Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vit@@ amine absorption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a one @-@ mal@@ dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a lower acceptance of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on Plas@@ ma@@ concentration camp .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal nature and hang together with the phar@@ maceuticals effect of medication , because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal reactions were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
the Frequ@@ encies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of the known side effects , which were identified after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
4 . it is pl@@ au@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i to convert in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal adverse reactions can result .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days , without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dose , no side effects or similar effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on humans and animal , from a quick re@@ formation of system@@ ic effects , which are attributable to the li@@ pas@@ ar men@@ tions of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect continues in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente Bin@@ der to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic light .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 provides the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at that was taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ thet@@ ical , fat @-@ induced diet .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was rated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed for 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of the LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
at the wa@@ ist circumference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at were not measured 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In the case of therapeutic doses not met@@ abolic or@@ list@@ at in plasma only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml , or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mol ) , and without signs of a Kum@@ ulation .

Alo@@ xi is applied to chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by an additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ emet@@ ic ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting ( 153 out of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . an approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with severe chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colo@@ rect@@ al passage , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty laws or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us according to the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful with the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is prolonged or that of such an extension .
besides in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy neither for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not tum@@ ble tum@@ ours of five studied chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of or@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based in a population based on a population of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ am@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ tron , chlor@@ et@@ id@@ ine , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ ge@@ al , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies should not be applied , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is necessary to be considered necessary .
clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observation side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sol@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of over@@ sensitive actions and reactions to the appoint@@ ments ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar courses presented themselves by un@@ wanted events such as in the other dos@@ ages ; there were no dose @-@ efficiency relations .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis however probably did not have effective therapy at an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of Dol@@ ph@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , who received intraven@@ ously every day 1 without D@@ am@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in , as well as 250 or 750 mcg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron that were given in day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical trials to indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EK@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron comparable .
according to the findings of clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the I@@ on@@ enk@@ ni@@ zation and Rep@@ os@@ ar@@ isation levels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EK@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations of a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally used in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in case of healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , which ranged between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron Plas@@ ma@@ concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical simul@@ ations , that at once daily intraven@@ ous gift from 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days in total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , with which after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg measured values , however , the C@@ max after the publication of 0.75 mg was higher .
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic lines compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for Met@@ abol@@ ism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and the CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 participated in the met@@ abolic ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made an un@@ changeable active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ jek@@ tion , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function , the terminal elim@@ ination measurement time and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , considered sufficient over the maximum human@@ ist exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical studies , claims that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ enk@@ o , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ isation and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose should be given in about the 30@@ fold of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , led to a higher frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ ophy@@ sa@@ c , pan@@ cre@@ as , an@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , but not with mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and da Alo@@ xi is dest@@ ined for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of this results will be low for humans .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative reference to authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C regulatory approval by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should have a biological medicines called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same physi@@ ne@@ il@@ ich effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference arz@@ az@@ ers &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one through a vir@@ al inf@@ ectious disease ) .
in case of a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage shows , the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ s al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood of blood .
it is produced by a le@@ es , into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the active agent .
the manufacturers of Alph@@ eon laid data on the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of pharmaceutical , efficiency , safety and effectiveness at hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Author@@ ised for the EMEA 2006 . what were the biggest concerns relating to the CH@@ MP recommendation to reconc@@ iling the CH@@ MP recommendation ?
furthermore , concerns themselves , concerns themselves that the data on the stability of the drug and the medicines are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , based on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting up the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease was infl@@ amed for more patients than at the reference value ; Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition to this study , the study enrolled in the study to evaluate the drug a immune response ( i.e. the body is antibodies against the medicine ) , not suff@@ iciently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pet@@ igo ( one with cruci@@ sten@@ osis ) and small in@@ clusions ma@@ ids ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pper ) , di@@ ced and se@@ eded wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections which are proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go is not working against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients with the age of nine months , but with patients under 18 years , the treatment surface may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should check the patient once again and check alternative treatments in path@@ ogen .
it works through block of bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its growth of bacteria .
the primary indi@@ ces of efficacy in all five studies of patients whose infection was de@@ ferred after the end of treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients filed under placebo .
in the treatment of infected hood , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates showed : if the results were taken together with skin hours , about 90 % of the patients were enrolled in the treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( eit@@ fully filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or by infections which have been proven or probably by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common side effects of Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation of the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go was transferred to the risks of the following surface treatment : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , de@@ di@@ ced or inclined wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission adopted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . an approval for the placing of al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvement within two to three days , should be considered once again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a Sen@@ si@@ bil@@ ization or severe local Ir@@ rit@@ ation due to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is cancelled , and an appropriate alternative therapy in the infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen or is thought ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary studies , the effectiveness of retin@@ ap@@ ulin was caused by infections with infections which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is supposed to be considered as a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected point .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to small plasma concentrations , which were reached in humans after top@@ ical application to the poor skin or infected wounds , a clinical @-@ relevant inhibit@@ ing in vivo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the medium Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment on the poor skin of healthy adult males by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to patients , dos@@ is@@ adjustments are not required for patients if top@@ ical retin@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive tox@@ icity after oral intake and are in@@ adequate in terms of effects to the birth and the red@@ als / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy when an top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ um .
in case of decision whether the breast@@ feeding was continued / terminated or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should be completed , is between the benefit of a nurs@@ ing for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials in 2@@ 150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported ad@@ mitt@@ ation of Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the appointment site that was about 1 % of the patients .
active st@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a certain binding point of the 50s of bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , diff@@ ers from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ sec@@ tional anti@@ bacterial substances .
the data indicates that the binder of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L3 is involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binder and pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ t centre .
by binder on this binder in@@ hibit P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine , pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block partially P @-@ binder inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
due to the local prevalence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear in at least some infection forms , a consultation should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ates ins@@ ens@@ itive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adult was placed 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and put on skin for up to 7 days .
of 516 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin oint@@ ment twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wounds have been gained .
sample preparation took place 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the median and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording at humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % oint@@ ment to 200 cm2 sh@@ ielded skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirt .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The Met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism in human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes was primarily convey@@ ed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under a lower participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases , which concern the liver ) for children aged between 1 and 15 years , who are not yet immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within two doses of existing vacc@@ ination , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , the Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation exists a lower risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the two doses of vacc@@ ines can be led to the end .
for a collection dose against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given .
in@@ vacc@@ ines may work by the immune system ( the natural body of the body ) , &quot; how it can be we@@ aving against a disease .
after a child received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; strange &quot; and generated antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine vaccine for Twin@@ rix adults and the Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three doses of existing vacc@@ ines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed one month after the last injection a protective antibodies .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine is compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite man@@ gel , pain at the injection station , tube , mat@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may react in patients suffering from allergic ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) react , not applied .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ y@@ s.@@ a. a approval for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the idle diagram for the Grun@@ dim@@ mer with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given to the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection @-@ vacc@@ ination is used for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ers vacc@@ ines or with a combined sim@@ p material .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccine .
it is not completely secured if immune individuals who have addressed to an Hepatitis C vacc@@ ination as protection , because they may also be protected by the immune memory by the immune memory .
3 As with all inj@@ ections , for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction , according to the gift of vacc@@ ination , corresponding opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard dim@@ mer is recommended to combine 360 ELISA units @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies resulting in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ination may be required .
as an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal Imp@@ air@@ way , this inj@@ ectors should be avoided .
in these cases , Ambi@@ rix may not be inj@@ ected by Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ie or blood disorders , since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular gift .
when Ambi@@ rix in the second year of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ ps ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mas@@ ern@@ m@@ um@@ ps ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients under immune stimul@@ ants therapy or patients with immun@@ ity must be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation , the frequency of pain , tube , sw@@ ing@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed at previous Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ination .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses is administered to a total of 10@@ 27 Imp@@ air@@ ings at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination image .
the only exceptions were the higher Frequ@@ encies of pain and mat on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the gift of a 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination image .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination of 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix was given , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ory was similar high ( i.e. via the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix was compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects that received 3 @-@ cans @-@ combined sim@@ p materials ) .
the incidence of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ ness was small and comparable to the combination of the combination with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination .
in a comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that by appointment with 360 ELISA units un@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , with the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a common appearance of pain ( at the injection of injection ) per dose , is not reported .
the share of Imp@@ fl@@ ingen , which covers severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination schem@@ as with the combination with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units formal@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen reported , was not statistically significant .
in clinical studies that were carried out during the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ con@@ dens@@ ation rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % have been carried out a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , a month 6 administered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ ver@@ aging rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , on the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to and including 15 years old , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combinations of three doses .
for the 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune answers that were achieved in a clinical study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the Imp@@ air@@ fields received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ inated vacc@@ inated with 360 ELISA units a@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in persons who were at the time of Grun@@ dim@@ mer between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ines .
the immun@@ ity reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens that made after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination skin , consisting of 360 ELISA units in activated H@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12- to and including 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine is comparable to the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ines .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second year of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ arly per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b @-@ vacc@@ ination ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vacc@@ ination was given , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation was carried out in adults , showed the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ors and ser@@ ver@@ aging rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is available both before and after the ten@@ us@@ pen@@ ance on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state Char@@ gen@@ ome will be carried out by a state laboratory or a lab authorized laboratory .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred by vir@@ al foods and beverages , but can also be transferred through other ways like through Baden in wast@@ ew@@ ater waters .
they can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a bl@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may be necessary to make a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix do not protect completely from an infection with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix already infected with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you don &apos;t feel un@@ likely or feel sick / feel ) may not prevent a vacc@@ ination .
a protection against other infections which cause the liver or symptoms which are similar to those of an Hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection that can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have already have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vacc@@ ination including ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can ut@@ ili@@ ze an allergic reaction or tongue of face or the tongue . • if you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • if you have a severe infection with fever / or hepatitis B .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the designated administration of the second vaccine ) .
for a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will advise you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of an incre@@ mental Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vacc@@ ination with reduced content is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the vaccine series .
sometimes the Ambi@@ rix is suffering from heavy blood disorders , considering the skin and not in the muscle . • if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own body , or if you are under@@ lined up / your child from a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis / underground .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is to the vacc@@ ination .
21 Do you cancel your doctor if you have any further medic@@ inal medicine ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without dis@@ closure ) , or if you have given them / your child recently / was given or immune lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) , or this is planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible various lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
the Ambi@@ rix sw@@ ang@@ ing or l@@ act@@ ating women is not enough , except it is ur@@ gently needed that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , you speak to your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs up to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been announced since issu@@ ance of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has the view that the value @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix was positive .
since the Ambi@@ rix only brought in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this product is limited due to low patient exposure .
Ammon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with full endo@@ thel@@ ial En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ium du@@ sty En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ) in the pre @-@ history .
am@@ aps will be divided into several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed up , while food is mixed or over a guest stainless steel ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a nostr@@ ils ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
there was no comparative study , because am@@ aps could not be compared with other treatment or placebo ( a placebo @-@ medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
am@@ aps may also be to appet@@ ite , a ab@@ nor@@ ms acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea disorders , abdom@@ inal pain , nau@@ sea , sti@@ p@@ ation , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , in@@ adequate body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ aps of patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle was effectively prevented .
Ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this product .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients , with which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ es had already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ fixed form ( in@@ complete endo@@ thel@@ ial form , which is manifest after the first life @-@ month ) , an indication for the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese exists a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with mud dysfunction , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein tolerance and the development of the daily protein intake of the patients .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as for her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ actic acid or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ sponder bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ ats@@ yn@@ thetic deficiency need to be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with mud dysfunction , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets do not reach immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) of sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ genital heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium re@@ funds and oil formation in phase only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and differentiation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat takes place above the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ inde@@ xed ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous free gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal verification and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed curing of zer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ sen and a reduced number of functional nerv@@ es in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is di@@ vor@@ ced in the breast milk , and this reason is the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the nurs@@ ing time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ wanted events were assumed that they had not stood with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in connection .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a more likely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ dis@@ ative patient in combination with Lak@@ tat@@ too . heavy mort@@ g@@ emia , arm@@ yt@@ open@@ ie , peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis developed .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 months old small child with an acci@@ dental individual dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limit neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phenol is a met@@ abolic combination that is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ amine glut@@ amine by acet@@ amine to phenol to phenol , which is di@@ vor@@ ced over the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as a alternative carrier for differentiation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram may be produced sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately begun to improve the survival of survival and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the earliest form of the disease with occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ rowing was earlier almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease led even in treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its st@@ ick@@ ening free analogue in the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ary ) , prot@@ otyp@@ ed K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase survival rate as neu@@ tered in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life month ) diagnostic diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients showed that time with many for intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ proof form of the disease ( including female patients with h@@ etero@@ zy@@ g@@ inal cord @-@ man@@ gels ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ astic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y and a prot@@ ect@@ omy diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phenol , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney lev@@ elling with glut@@ amine glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were identified after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat for so@@ unding healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts from orange doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ abol@@ ites also was investigated for intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ic .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after the intake of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or ha@@ em@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ y was det@@ ectable in accordance with different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) on the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ic acet@@ ate in plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which have been treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day of oral in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is carried out within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated production of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had been treated with tox@@ icity and non @-@ toxic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low any tablets ) or patients with sl@@ u@@ ck@@ om@@ ial or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as for her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal area .
in patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ actic acid or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ sponder bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed to phenol in front of the birth of phen@@ yl@@ actic acid ( active Met@@ abol@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of the Hir@@ n@@ r@@ inde .
a more likely toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ dis@@ ative patient in combination with Lak@@ tat@@ too . heavy mort@@ g@@ emia , arm@@ yt@@ open@@ ie , peripheral Neurop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis developed .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxi@@ des ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as a alternative carrier for differentiation of excess
on the basis of investigations about the differentiation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram may be produced sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were determined .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this incident , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient must have received the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so that they can non @-@ ins@@ ulated waste products that cannot be separated from protein in the body after consumption of proteins .
if you are using laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you can use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicine or recently taken , even if it is not pres@@ cription drug .
during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could over@@ go over the breast milk and damage to your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , flav@@ our@@ ing disorders , im@@ ori@@ enti@@ ent , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states were observed .
if you determine one of these symptoms , immediately contact with your doctor or with the emergency absorption of your hospital for the introduction of a corresponding treatment in connection .
if you have forgotten AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood vessels to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest basket with different strength ) or my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart failure ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ac or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go one PCI , a higher dose is administered and the fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart failure , this can contribute to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS when the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was involved in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ antibodies ) and a G@@ PI .
while the PCI was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the Ar@@ ter@@ ie to prevent a closure ) , and they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
when the ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - with or without gift of new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac disease or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as H@@ ep@@ arin , except severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it may not be applied to patients who had recently had a blood , as well as people with strong blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is a replacement for H@@ ep@@ arin &apos;s treatment during the treatment of ACS and a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission adopted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd appro@@ ves an approval for the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ari@@ an@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ tures ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) for an emergency aid or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is performed using a PCI PCI , an additional Bol@@ us should be given up to 0.5 mg / kg and increases the fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI PCI , the reduced rental dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an subsequent intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and effectiveness of a large bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI entry is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be done .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medic@@ inal drug should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is not necessary , provided , the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with medium @-@ severe kidney failure ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is treated to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ valent ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , is a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg and will test the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ dose .
in patients with moderate kidney disease which resulted in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be guided 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ ction H@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of low @-@ molecular H@@ ep@@ arin .
• known over@@ sensitivity against active substance or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active blood disorders , or ir@@ reversible effects of hem@@ at@@ itis . • heavier kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and measured in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully tested during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bloo@@ d@@ ess , especially if bi@@ valent is administered in combination with another antibodies ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if using PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most bleeding in the arter@@ ial points can occur in patients who can under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment can occur everywhere .
in patients who are treated to war@@ far@@ in and with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International standardis@@ ation ratio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in once again reaches the level of existing level .
starting from the knowledge about the active mechanism of antibodies by antibodies ( H@@ ep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ ist ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase blood .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ at@@ ric parameters are regularly monitored regularly in any case regularly .
the experimental studies are involved in relation to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , integration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ fra@@ ction H@@ ep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients with H@@ ep@@ arin treated patients were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ wanted events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined after AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding occur below Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine alone significantly less often than in the groups with H@@ ep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular bleeding or blood pressure required , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 g / dl without any obvious blood point , reduction of hem@@ odi@@ um spi@@ racy of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding station , re@@ operation due to a blood pressure , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ alis@@ ations that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , &quot; Other &quot; scores , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal , ear , nose or thro@@ at .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who under@@ go one PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients with H@@ ep@@ arin treated patients were more frequent in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ wanted events than in male or younger patients .

the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after comprehensive use in practice and are assigned to system organs in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ is immediately pressed immediately and to monitor the patient in relation to the signs of a bloo@@ d@@ gement .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific t@@ rom@@ bin@@ s , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as to the ion@@ en@@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in bin@@ ds , regardless of whether t@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ ows the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly which generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with serum of patients , in which it came to h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ie / h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ wel aggregate reaction was induced .
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in shows a dos@@ is@@ - and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ corrosive effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if the patient was conducted in a PCI option , an additional Bol@@ us should be increased from 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ valent in and the fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in the arm A of AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ questi@@ oned H@@ ep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ tures ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall or the upper arm or the upper arm with a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease that produces not enough ins@@ ulin on the control of glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin cannot process effect .
ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin diff@@ ers very mar@@ gin@@ ally of human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means it &apos;s faster and a shorter working duration is as a short @-@ short human@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin @-@ in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two trials with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , when the body &apos;s ins@@ ulin was not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.14 % in ins@@ ulin inj@@ ections .
for adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months compared with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal normal ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied to patients who are possibly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who suffer from a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medic@@ inal products that can work on blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH an approval for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is available as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdom@@ inal cord or delay by continuous infusion in the field of pan@@ cre@@ - and apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous in the field of pan@@ cre@@ - .
due to the reduced glucose levels and reduced ins@@ ulin changes the ins@@ ulin needs can be reduced by patients with an restriction of the liver function .
any change of the impact strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , del@@ del@@ ays etc ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin demand .
3 A in@@ adequate dosage or demol@@ ition of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ able diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic c@@ eto@@ azi@@ onale ; these states are potentially li@@ mat@@ ory .
the change@@ over of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin should be made under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the time of an h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia depends on the ins@@ ulin profile of the ins@@ ulin and can therefore change at the change@@ over of treatment schem@@ as .

severe h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ric cells with consciousness can be given by means of in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which will be treated by a doctor or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ ine cause for severe h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar level through the stimul@@ ating blood glucose ( especially through sk@@ el@@ sk@@ el@@ mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing of Glu@@ cos@@ y production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous g@@ a- levels of ins@@ ulin is faster and the active duration is shorter than for hu@@ - man@@ oeu@@ v@@ ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes m@@ tus , ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeutic measurement range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional increase of glu@@ ing effects , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase of glu@@ ing effects , exactly as human ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin has twice the fast efficiency occurs as normal human@@ ins@@ ulin and achieved complete glu@@ ing effects about 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
the data was evident that at an application of ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ glyc@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control was given as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of meal , there will be a comparable glyc@@ em@@ ic control as in human normal @-@ ins@@ ulin , which will be given 2 days before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin at a gift of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before the start of meal compared to human normal ins@@ ulin , 30 minutes before the start of meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
