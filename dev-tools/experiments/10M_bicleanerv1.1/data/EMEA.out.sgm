<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg processed cheese tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and as a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speaking, Hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not available), missiles and wounds; • bipolar-I disorder, a psychological disease, where the patients are manageing (periods) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of heavy-severe episodes and preventive episodes in patients who spoke in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for fast control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases the solution can be used for inserting or the melting tablet chains in patients who prepares the slucks of tablets trouble.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells using "neurotrangeitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol works probably in particular as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotranitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripiprazol as 5-hydroxytryptamin and Dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neurotranitter acts as the receptors to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine with schizophrenia and bipolar disturbance to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manian symptoms and their recovery will be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, that to prevent symptoms occur in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo that were to be stabilized on 160 patients with which the manian symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was caused in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disturbance that suffered from Lorazepam (another antipsychological) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients were based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate such as the body uses the melting tablet and the solution to absorb resorating (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution showed patients that received Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms were increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat the bipolar disorder, Abilify was reduced in four of the five short-time studies of manian symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo in previously treated episodes at previously treated patients and when it was given in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo the symptoms were afflicted and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache (dilution), synolence (seclusion), abnormalities (distipation), salies (distipation), saliva (distipation), saliva (higher memory production), fatigue and exhaustion (increased memory production), tiredness and exhaustion, olicoirs, insomebody (sleep disturbance) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The conclusion for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of medium-severe episodes in patients who had mainly manian episodes and in which the manian episodes had to treat the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of breast cancer patients with schizophrenia or in patients with managophrenia or in patients with lack of patients with bipolar-I disorder when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for the placing on Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is designed for the treatment of constant up to severe episodes of bipolar episodes and for prevention of a new manian episode in patients who had mainly manian episodes and their manian episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day in a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness with doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With view to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor consists of combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of supreme behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disturbance, an increased cross-risk cancer with Aripiprazol gave comparison to other antipsychotica compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are applied for hypotony (dehydration, Hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure sensitive pharmaceuticals) or hypertension (including acute malignant and malignant shape).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies that were a year or less, there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If using an ABILIFY treated patients and symptoms of a late dyskinesis should occur, the dose should reduce or break the dose.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs and symptoms developed on a mn, or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotica must be set up, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Aripiprazol should be used in patients with craampite cases in the anamnese or in condition that are to be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis, patients who were associated with Alzheimer's disease patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an increased death rate compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however in one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the talk for undesirable events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia in some cases are extremely and associated with Ketoaziel or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was treated with atypical antipsychotic active ingredients including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no accurate risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related undesirable events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic active ingredients treated with the direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphenation, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of happiness values.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally known for schizophrens patients and in patients with bipolar manie due to Comorbidities, the application of antipsychotica, in which weight gain is known as a tribution, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Because of the primary effects of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system is careful if Aripiprazol is not taken in combination with alcohol or other centralized medicines with side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist is Famotidine, a Magenic blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, whereby this effect is not relevant as clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC from Aripiprazol to 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to be that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetin, similar effects have, and therefore similar dosisrereductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism, the joint application can result with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol as compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you prefer the common gift of Ketoconazol or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should overtake potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protectors, should have similar effects and therefore should similar dosisrereductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After pressing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a constant increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials showed doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day no significant effect on the metabolic rate of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodology ratio), 2C19 (Wareprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">People should be recommended to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data protection regarding human beings and due to the reproductive studies during the reproductive studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is justified for the Fötus.</seg>
<seg id="60">As yet with other antipsychotica the patients should be warned, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to use until they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The number of adverse events listed below are defined in accordance with the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, were treated with Aripiprazol, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathonie and dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was conducted in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients under Olantic therapy.</seg>

<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was conducted in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term planning, over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinemulation controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and cptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol patients, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the adverse events that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence with Aripiprazol, the malignant neurodegenerative syndrome, Spätdyskinesis, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute survivors with Aripiprazol was observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis treatment in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose is because Aripiprazol has a high plasma connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazol at schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder via the combination of a partial agonist effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor receptor as well as a moderate affinity for Dopamine D4-, to Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 adore and to the Histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily, the Positalian Emission Emission Tomography showed a dosisdependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor-ligor, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the turkey.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazol showed a statistically significantly stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled study was 52% of the response of response to study medication, similar to study medication which were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messenger, defined as secondary degree programmes, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression scale showed significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patient with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olano-controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia more than 26 weeks, the 314 patients included in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a more flexible dosage of 3 weeks with a manian or mixed episode of bipolar I disturbance, Aripiprazol showed an increase in placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manian or mixed episode of bipolar I disturbance, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficiency compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed an impact effect compared to placebo that was comparable with lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also proved a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of manie on like Lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial more than 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic surgery, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of manotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial more than 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension of more than 74 weeks, the Aripiprazol showed a remission compared to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar response, mainly when prevention of a bipolar response.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion and hydroxyreation of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkylation is offset by CYP3A4 catalyst.</seg>
<seg id="89">The medium elimination of elimination cycles is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol at an extensive metabolic type of CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolic syndrome via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic investigation of patients no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics revealed no indication of clinical significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or the impact of the space on the pharmaceuticals of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aripiprazol and dehydro-Aripiprazol was similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study on subjects with different grave liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazol and dehydration of Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to pull them on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies to safety charges, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproductive toxicity and for canogens potential, the preclinical data left no particular dangers to men.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with doses or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects found a dospertaining side effects (Lipofuscin pigments (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for people) and an increase of side-carcinoma / carcinoma during female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the medium steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the reduction of sulfate conjugate of Aripiprazol in the Galle of Monkeys to repeated oral care (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human gestion at the highest recommended daily recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulfate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) in vitro solutions.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after doses that led to expositions of the 3- and 11fold of the middle Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European opening report (EPAR), which explains, as the Committee for Humanities (CHMP), discussed in order to evaluate recommendations concerning the application of the pharmaceutical.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in which Metformin (a diabetic drug is not displayed). • It can be used together with another diabetic drug (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients), the metformin alone cannot be satisfactory in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose can be retained, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), except patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of Sulfonyl resin or the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better tolerated and the blood sugar level drops, thus reducing type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripleotherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metal formin with a sulphurylharp, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies the concentration of a substance was measured in blood (glycaylized hemoglobin, HbA1c), which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in a lowering of the HbA1c value, which ensures that the blood sugar values were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplea study, the effect of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphurylharp in a reduction in the HbA1c values increased by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin at 289 patients were examined, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin received a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were visual disorders, infections of the upper respiratory paths (cold), weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity compared to maturity).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may neither be applied to patients who are possibly oversensitive (allergic) versus Pioglitazon or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic Ketoazia (high killary mirror - acidity level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos is to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with Metformin in patients.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission adopted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited an approval for placing cars in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, round, curved and carry on one side the inscription "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin-insulin with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient and especially suitable for contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who have at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), a decompensated heart failure should start to increase treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or eyelids are observed, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oil can be observed when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular study conducted with Pioglitazon patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macroval disease has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase of reports about heart failure, which led to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other signs of a liver disease, Pioglitazi may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area are increased, the liver enzymes are returned as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is designed to prove on a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, outshell, fatigue, appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymes to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon continued to be led until they are led to the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon a dosages weight increase, which can stir up of fat deposits and connected in some cases with a liquid.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hematution, a lower reduction in the medium-optic nerve values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazone for patients under metformin (relative reduction of haematoctits around 3.6-4.1%) and to a lower extent even in patients under sulphurylhardening and insulin (relative reduction of hemhaybins by 1-2% and haematocrits around 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insinsensitivity, patients who received pioglitazon as a bi-phase or triple-combination therapy with insulin therapy, the risk of a dosisdependent Hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, under the treatment with ThiazolidIndions, including Pioglitazon, including an appearance or deterioration of a diabetic macular hole reported using a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether it gives a direct link between taking Pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaopmen, but veraging doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular cases when patients should report on interference above disorders of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarised analysis of messages unwanted events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence amounted to 1.9 Fractures per 100 patient years with the Pioglitazan treated women and 1.1 fractures for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient has a pregnancy or if it occurs, the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazi does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. orale contradiction, Cyclosporin, Calciumkanalnaked and HMGCoA-Reductasparmer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with the fibrosis Council (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is primarily attributable to treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance of the parent, thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not rated from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the Turgors and the Brechoral complex of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglyphic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT ascents joined the trifold of the upper limit as below placebo, however more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphurylharp.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macroval disease was the incidence of a serious heart failure under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely has been reported using heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazon had been used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summarised analysis of messages unwanted events regarding bone brood, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients in the with Pioglitazon groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative study groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3,5 years, Fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients with Pioglitazan treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">At taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did no symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work via a activation specific kernel of reptor γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver -, fat and skeleton cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon glued the Glucosy production in the liver and increases peripheral Glucosevers in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as Monotherapy has been carried out over two years to investigate the time by the therapeutic effectiveness (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was defined by Pioglitazon at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was adjusted despite three imonatiger optimisation, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">Patients under Pioglitazon reduced the average HbA1c - value around 0.45% compared to the patients who received only insulin-insulin at Pioglitazan treated with Pioglitazon group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinine queries compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was checked in a small one, on 18 weeks for analysis of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol and slightly significantly increased LDL- cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon compared to placebo, Metformin or Gliclazid the total plasmatrified and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo was not statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol while under metformin and Gliclazid reduced values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride level, but also improved also the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which includes both an effect on the triglycerid absorption and also on the hepic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a cardiovascular study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After orally application, Pioglitazone will quickly resorate quickly, whereby the peak concentrations in the plasma is normally reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the efficacy of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficiency of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interact studies, Pioglitazi could no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with the fibrosis Council (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oraler application of radioactive pioglitazon at humans the marker was found mainly in the thread (55%) and to a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination of plasma-elimination of pure Pioglitazon amounts to 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolic rate is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolic strings are lower than in healthy subjects with limited kidney function, whereby the rates of oral cleance of the parent is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, pursuant to repeated administration of plasma torment, anemia and reversible excentric cardiac disease.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is primarily attributable to treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance of the parent, thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years old) increased inziation of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family-run polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other ThiazolidIndions resulted in an increased frequency of colonies.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of Metformin each have been studied with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decline in the albumine / creatinine quintents showed a statistically significant decrease in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazi reduced not only the sober triglyceride level, but improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this is both an effect on Tryglyzerid absorption and also on hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing with their primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardiarisation, leg amputation above the Knuterus, leg amputation by the Knukularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, indicate that the results of Pioglitazi have no cardiovascular risk.</seg>

<seg id="1404">Main indebator of the effectiveness was the number of patients who was tuned after a year after treatment duration of a year (as often as often a renewed organ transplantation or a re-recording of the dialysis needed).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more recent studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined, as Cagraf is recorded in comparison to Prograf / prograft of the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immune stimulant therapy and treatment of transplantationes should be able to arrange this medication or changes in the immune stimulant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplant or to an increased incidence of adverse events, including under- or overweight.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; alterations of the formulation or regimes should only be made under the close control of one in the transplantation control (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a sequence of changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Cagraf should be based on clinical assessment of aboutpouring and tolerability in individual and on blood level regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After migration from Prograf on Cagraf you should be controlled by the Tacrolimus Talmirror in front of the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposure was measured as Talmirror, with both forbays both in kidney stones and similar patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and re-repeated controls of the Tacrolimus Talmirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate impregnation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low cleance, a adaptation of the Cagraf-Dosisschemas can take several days until the steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application In the suppression of transplant, the immunosges must be observed; a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplantation of the graft cancels The orale Advocf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustment may be necessary later, as the pharyninetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of the graft test treatment should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf on Advocf must be converted into a daily dosage of Prograf capsules twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules, so this change in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a transition from other Immunoskelsiva on Cagraf once daily must begin treatment with the recommended initial initial dose for the prophylaxis of the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Corneal transplantation At adult patients who are applied on Cagraf is a oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receivers Although there are no clinical experience with Cagraf in lung, pancreas and daral transplanted patients at an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplant patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in special patient groups with reduced liver function For maintaining blood mirror in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Da renal function does not exercise influence on pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it may not be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum samples, a calculation of the atinine and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Ciclosporin on Cagraf At the changeover of a Ciclosporin- based on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is careful (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the bottom level in the thoroughbred The dose should be based on clinical assessment of aboutpouring and tolerability in individual cases under assignment of whole blood-Tacrolimus-Talking controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus Talmirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood flow levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled by Prograf on Cagraf, Dosisadjustment, changes to immune stimulant therapy or in simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Cagraf is a drug with a low cleance, the dose of the dose may need several days until the steady State entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the Talking level should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talrolimus valley lie in the first time after liver transplant in the first time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent detection of liver -, kidney and cardiac transplantations were used as a rule of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">It has led to serious adverse events, including transplant impulse or other side effects, which may occur in a consequence of Tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; alterations of the formulation or regimes should only be made under the close control of one in the transplantation control (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft, which proved to be proven against other Immunoskelsiva as a therapy, there are currently no clinical data for the retaining formulation of Cagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">To the prophylaxis of graft reactions in adult heart transplant and transplants are currently no clinical data for the retaining formulation of Cagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to potential interactions, which can lead to a decrease of the Tacrolimus level in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the Laiskraut (hypericum perforated), or other plant protection during a treatment with Cagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus-blood mirror can be subjected to such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under prograf was described as a cardiomyopathy chamber or septumhypertrophy, which can therefore occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances, a treatment with cork eroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, liquid loading and furnaces.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other Immunoskelsiva, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of skin by suitable clothing or use of solar control by using a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take the Tacrolimus, symptoms of Pres such as headache, changing consciousness and visual disorders should show a radical study (e.g).</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or plant healers, known as Hemmer or inductors of CYP3A4, can increase the metabolism of Tacrolimus and therefore reduce blood values of Tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to change the Tacrolimus- blood mirror at the same time of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and to monitor the Tacrolimus dose to maintaining equal effects (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interchangeable effect was made with anemykotica such as Ketoconazol, Fluconazol, Itraconazol, Itraconazol and Voriconazol as well as with the Macrolid antibiromycin and HIV protectors.</seg>

<seg id="1454">High-dosified prednisolon or methylprednisolone, as it is used for acute diimperation activities, increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in blood or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus with drugs which can be metabolic by CYP3A4 whose metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus reduce the clearing of steroid-contrasting and to increase the hormone level, it is particularly careful with decisions concerning receiving measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus will reduce the clearing of Pentobarbital and phenazon and their half-time.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematric value and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unrestricted faction of Tacrolimus, or caused by treatment with cork-eroids are responsible for determining the higher clearing rates after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This can close that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolic, with the distinction mainly via the Galle.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients suffering from prograf (twice daily) at Cagraf (once daily) at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was nearly 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application may be addressed whether they are applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood cells like bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method described as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of the human Gerinnacle factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">In one another in the European Union approved medications called Recombinate, however, it is similar, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advantages was awarded in 86% of 510 new blood vessels with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advates (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, Pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">In patients may not be applied to patients who may be sensitive (allergic) against the human Gerinnment factor VIII, mouse or Hamsterprotein, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Baxter AG an approval for the placing of the European Union in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substrate therapy are addressed according to the severity of factor VIII of VIII, after the place and the magnitude of blood and the clinical state of patients.</seg>

<seg id="1545">During treatment, it is enriched to the control of the administered dose and frequency of injections a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma bricks.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different semesters.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be reached or if the blood of blood is not dominated by an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out if necessary for inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures will need to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The delivery speed should be addressed according to the patients, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG Immunglobuline who are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by means of modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days will depend on the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">With pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnecetting-known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, remotely observed (lower) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare imaging of hemophilia A in women are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and nursing.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who were treated in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for education of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the approval of available data, the CHMP has continued to benefit the benefit risk compensation as positive, but in fact that the safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has been based on the basis of security fils of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation has to apply a further renewal procedure for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited issued the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) officially announced that the company will permit its application for placing on approval for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the wheat parts (tissue, connects the other structures in the body, surrounds and support).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that genetically modified genetically that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" which was so significant that there was no copies of themselves and thus cannot solve the infections of humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Cexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from which non-defective in the human body is made of a p53-gene, usually it is usually to be damaged DNA and kill cells when the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer, which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not correct, and the cancer cells can grow further and share themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient in front of the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of substructures in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP answers the company's answers to the questions, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the exam of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP has created a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP view, the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors are advantageous for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee had further concerns regarding the processing of medicines in the body, the type of administration, as well as the safety of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not been sufficient that we can be manufactured in reliable way that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The CHMP has not been in knowledge whether the response consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advantin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed active ingredients," means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the most effective ingredients are immediately released and the other slowly is released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic Rhinitis (locustrades, caused by an allergy against pollen mutation of the nose) in patients with Nasenmucosa swelling (cloak nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of aerinaze twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucous membranes (abopaque nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The major effective dimensions were the changes of the severity of the locustupfensitique, which were reported in the treatment before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study patients the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, such as difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the localization of the nose reported the patients who reported aerobic revenues, over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving Pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the Nasenmucosa was considered, the patients showed an linking of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), mouthiness, swingness, psychologists (appetite), angioplasty, fatigue, fatigue, Insomnia (insomnia), Somnolence (sleep mode), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephedrin, or one of the other components, against adrenerge agents or Loratadin (a different medicines for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (hypertension), hyperthyroose (hypertension of thyroid), or already have a hemorrhagic stroke (hypertension caused by a brain disease) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a approval to the company SP Europe for placing aerating aerobic plant in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without them to break, break or cut down).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data to uncertainty and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is so short as possible and should not be continued after closing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time on 10 days, as long as long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrin with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decline of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin, the medicine is also treated with patients who are treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity of combined use of Pseudoephedrin with other vasoconstrictors such as Bromothotamin or other Dekongerva, phenylpropanamine, phenylleek, phenylleek, Ephedrin, Oxymetazolin, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient's patients and not enough to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and effectiveness of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver problems and the data is not sufficient to discuss corresponding recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment at the age of hypertension or tachycarat or of Palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea or etwaigen other neurologic symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of the headache) must be set.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patients age groups: • patients under DIGITALIS • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamnese, Diabetes Mellitus, bladder, or Bronchospasmus in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before the execution of dermatological tests, as Antihistaminika otherwise prevent positive reactions to prevent skin reaction or in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazol was given in addition, there were no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the Plasmaconcentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychological tests, no significant differences could be detected between the patients with Desloratadin and treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This was not identified for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible enzyme, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicinal CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The unimaginative of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconical characteristics of Pseudoephedrin should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified that it can occur in very rare cases, which can lead to an impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a ZNS depression (Sedation, Apnoe, diversified spiritual attention, cyanosis, Koma, heart-cycle collaps) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, Hallucinations, Tremor, Constitutions) with possible clauses.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, terrific muscle voltage, Euphorie, pathogen, palpitations, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, Schwinn, Tinnitus, Ataxie, visionary disorders and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is particularly likely to children, as well as Atropin-typical symptoms (moudron, turquillary arre and dilemation, hood, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human body cells / Basophile, as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the P-seless of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no effect on standard measuring sizes including the amplification subjective, or the tasks that are connected to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In clinical trials, there was no increased frequency of 5 mg daily, compared to placebo compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can give more sympathomimetical effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachykarate or manifestations of a ZNS detection.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1.248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic Rhinitis, where 414 patients were aerobic tablets received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamantagonist effectiveness of aerobaze tablets, determined based on the overall scores for symptomatic (except Nasenmugermination), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin via the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerobic tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined based on the nostrils, was significantly higher than in a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study to pharyninetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is verifiable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the Peruvian application of aerinaze with healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrin was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetist multidosisstudy, which was conducted using the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult patients was found that four subjects Desloratadin badly diverts.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components-interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrin after the sole gift of Pseudoephedrin bioequivalent was for exposure to the gift of an aerobic tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies to security spharology, for toxicity in repeated treatment, to genotoxicity and reproductive diagnosis, the preclinical data with desloratadin however no particular dangers for people recognize.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the effects observed were generally related to the content of Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive stoicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrin was not teratched in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was investigated in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic Rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms of symptoms (Juckreiz, number and size of paddles, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to prove that the body makes the syrup, the solution for inserting and the melting tray in the same way as tablets and application in children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic Rhinitis, the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of symptom (symptom points) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria, the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to placebo was treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, Loratadin, or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1732">With persistent allergic Rhinitis (appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patients can be recommended to treat a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were detected in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets not detected, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazol have been given additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmaceuticals study was not strengthened by alcohol (see section 5.1) in a clinical-pharynological study (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified in fact that in very rare cases it can result in very rare cases, which can lead to an impairment of transport or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in various indications, including allergic Rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urtikaria, were reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that was reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue (1.2%), oral dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadin, and 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multidose study, with up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (ninth clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human body cells / Basophile, as well as the expression of expression of the expression of the P-seless of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multiple outlets, in the Desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic Rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the line of symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensecretion and Juckreiz of the nose, Juckreiz, trams and tubes of the eyes as well as Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic Rhinitis can alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic Rhinitis and persistent allergic Rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic Rhinitis is defined as a result of symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic Rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As from the total score of fractance at Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively induced Aerius effectively caused by seasonal allergic Rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was also examined for further forms of the urticaria, since the underlying Pathophysiology is imaging with different forms similar to the different forms and chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histaminant is expected to achieve a real factor of all urtikariine diseases, besides chronic idiopathic urticaria, also in other forms of the urtikaria lead to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the upgrade of Pruritus and the size of Quaddles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with Antihistamine in chronic idiopathic, the minority was reacted out of patients who did not react to antihistamine.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the jewellery by more than 50% was observed in 55% of the patients with desloratine treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, similar to the patients-demos with the general seasonal allergic Rhinitis population, was achieved in 4% of patients a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no application points for a clinical-relevant Kumulation after a daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">This was not identified for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible enzyme, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicinal CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals to prevent symptoms of allergic Rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic Rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The doctor may be aware that most cases of rhinitis could be caused by infection under 2 years (see section 4.4) and that no data are prevalent to support the treatment of an infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory diseases or anatomical anomalies should play the anamnese, physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin examination.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children from 2 to 11 years metabolic Desloratadin restricted and experienced a higher substrate load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years old, limited metabolic, is identical with the children who abolizes normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medication contains Saccharose and Sorbitol; therefore patients with inherited problems of a fructose Intolerance, glucose-Galactose-absorpation or a saccharase-Isomaltas- insufficiency cannot take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, in which Erythromycin or Ketoconazol have been given additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmaceuticals study was not amplified by Aerius tablets and alcohol the most powerful effects of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The totality of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic Rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urtikaria, were reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, when in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multidose study on adults and adolescents, with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (ninety clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years, who arrived for an antihistaminotherapy in question received daily desloratadindosis of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic Rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin with adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratine can be extrapolated with adults on the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study with multiple outlets in adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmaceuticals study on adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of slashes compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">During a single daily dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets produced in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impairment of psychologist.</seg>

<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic Rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in the line of symptoms such as nies, Nasensecretion and Juckreiz of the nose, Juckreiz, trams and tubes of the eyes as well as Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As from the total score of fractance at Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively has been reduced by seasonal allergic Rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the upgrade of Pruritus and the size of Quaddles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Dissemination of this limited metabolic phenotyps was similar in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinic parameters were obtained in a pharmacokinetic majority-dose study with the siderformulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic Rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6times higher and the Cmax approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-time span of approximately 120 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza which is caused by the trunk (Type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which may cause a tribe of influenza which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic breaks out if a new trunk of influenza is dispared, who can spread slightly from humans, because people still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the parts of the influenza, as "body strange" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system later is able to form a quick antibody in contact with a Grippevirus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membranes surface that detects human body as body strange) are cleaned, cleaned and used as a component of vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient to fulfil the requirements of the vaccination of vaccination, to fulfil the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for preventive vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, with the human immunodeficiency syndrome type 1 (HIV-1) which caused the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can not swallow the capsules as a solution for inserting the capsules, but this can not be taken together with Ritonavir, since the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should then be classified, if the doctor has checked, who previously taken antiviral medicines of the patient previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus may be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is aimed at body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenase reduces HIV-amount in blood in combination with other antiviral medicines, and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS cannot heal AIDS, however, however, the damage of the immune system and the development of AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, which were not treated with protectors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This was compared with low endothelial Ritonavir reinforced medicine Agenase was compared with 206 adults who compared with other protectors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Major indebator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with not detectable concentrations of HIV in blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had not taken any protein after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenase was less effective as Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, with but of the children who were previously treated with protectors, only very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who have been treated with protectors were treated with Ritonavir reinforced pharmaceuticals Agenase the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protectors.</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protectors, it came under Agenase together with Ritonavir to a stronger decrease of viral load after four weeks as in the patient receiving their previous proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be applied to patients who may be sensitive (allergic) against Ambavir or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 intreated adults and children over four years compared to risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetical amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee presented that the benefit of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have not taken no protectors.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances, because at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>

<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenase capsules should be administered by Ambavir with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambavir should be made under consideration of the individual viral resistance and the treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambavir as a solution for insertion is 14% lower than by Ambavir as capsule; therefore Agenase capsules and solution for inserting a milligram per milligrams of base are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg Ambavir twice daily together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 When Agenase capsules are applied without the amplification of Ritonavir (boosted), higher doses have to be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Ambavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmaceuticals, efficacy and safety of Agenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protectors were not investigated by children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data to unimaginative and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinic data, the dose to Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction on 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or excessive liver interference with respect to patients with severe liver problems it is conindexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase must not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also substrate of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable supplements, the Johanniskraut (hypericum perforated) may not be applied due to the risk of reducing plasma concentrations, and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ambavir during the intake of Ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be noted that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy did not lead to a healing of HIV infection, and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenase does not prevent the risk of a transfer of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have an increased risk for heavy liver side effects with potentially fatal development.</seg>

<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with certain virus sensitivity compared to Agenase, at least one another PI and at least one nRTI were included in the research study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis set the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI Group regarding the time adjusted average change of the output value (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sub-reduction of 0.4 logged copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the efficacy of unborn Agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies, Agenase solution was administered twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was given no low dosional Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) together with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered during the treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children who are expected to be considered "unoostered" Agenase in bed.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the medium duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambavir amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax, reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with Ambavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in steady-State (Cmin, ss) is unaffected by the dietary absorption, although the simultaneous food intake increases the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can close to a large distribution volume as well as a imhindered penetration of Ambavir from blood circulation into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the overall concentration of active in plasma, with the amount of unbound Ambavir, which remains the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of inbound Ambavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosing intervals during the metady-State concentration in the Steady-State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore the drugs that the CYP3A4 can display or inhibit or a substrat of CYP3A4 which are given to be careful if they are given simultaneously with Agenase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ambavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made of 14% less biotic available as from the capsules; therefore Agenase Solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on a millionth basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal cleance of Ritonavir can be negligible, therefore the impact of a renal disorder is likely to be low to the elimination of Ambavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Ambavir plasma influences that are comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Ambavir twice daily without a simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the canopogenicity with Ambavir to mice and rats appeared in male animals hepatocne hepatocularly Adenomas on human exposure to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8- (rat), after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatoccellular Adenomas and Carcinoma was still unexplained and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on humans, both clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application, however, little evidence for accepting a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxizable tests, the bacterial-lymphoma test, microcore test in rats and chromosome test results in human peripheral lymphocytes, Ambavir was neither dirty nor genotoxically.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase are monitored and detected.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, in clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity in patients were observed, neither during the administration of Agenase, still after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in young, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed both the control as well as with Ambavir treated animals a high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systematic plasma creation, which was significantly less (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage at humans, however, a number of slight changes including thymuselongation and lower skeleton changes were observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24. if Agenase capsules are applied without the amplification of Ritonavir (boosted), higher doses have to be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Ambavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2082">The imaging of Agenase was investigated in adults and in children 4 years of clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of an overdose the patient is observed on the signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary measures necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Antiviral activity of Ambavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymphocytes cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Ambavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM at acute blood cells and is 0.41 µM in chronic cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">In reverse, Ambavir retains its activity against some other protectors of the insist isolate isolate; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, with PI pre-treated children, the benefit of an unexpected benefit of "unborn" Agenase are considered to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unexpected Ambavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosing intervals during the metady-State concentration in the Steady-State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore the drugs that the CYP3A4 can display or inhibit or a substrat of CYP3A4 which are given to be careful if they are given simultaneously with Agenase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme acquires the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), Hitzealgia, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and Schütz.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied (allergic) on laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be announced every year all new information that may be known, check and this summary required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who received the Aldurazyme as regards the reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission adopted Genzyme Europe B.V. an approval to the placing of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed to patients with secured diagnosis of a Muffysaccharides (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) indexed to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazi treated patients can develop infusioned reactions, which are defined as any common side effects, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also be monitored also engined, and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment, in which reinvigating equipment for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG-antibodies against laronidase are usually established within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a infusioned reaction must be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience in the treatment of treatment after a longer interruption must be careful due to the theoretically increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyrika) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusible reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or medium infusioned reaction, treatment with antihistaminika and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate, in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, heavy infusioned reaction, the infusion must be stopped, until the symptoms have been killed, a treatment with antihistaminika and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion in the infusion of the infusion rate is 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistaminika and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the past reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or procain because a potential risk of an interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data was exposed to newborns that were exposed to laronidase over the breast milk, it is recommended to avoid during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials have been classified as infusian-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable medicines in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and of their extension during a total treatment duration of up to 4 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some cases with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory paths and lungs in the prehistory there were heavy reactions to, including bronchospasmus, breathing and facial (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted pharmaceuticals effects associated with Aldurazyme, during a phase 2 study with 20 patients aged 5 years, with predominantly heavier form and treatment duration up to 12 months, were reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">Once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Within 3 months after the treatment of treatment, it was within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconical version, with the most severe decrease in patients at a Serconical version (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature ejaculation from the study) were detectable in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies before, among them 3 patients who never came to Serconical version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing up to low anti-antibodies mirror, a robust reduction in the GAG spider in Harn, while in patients with high anti-antibodies reported a variable reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal effect to low-neutralizing the oral effect on the enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed to be affected by clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not occur in connection with the incidence of adverse drugs actions, even if the occurrence of adverse drugs actions typically fell with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for enzymes therapy is located in one for the hydrolyse of the akcumulated substrate and preventing a further accumulation sufficient recovery of enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the Lysosomes, the most likely about Mannose-6 phosphatric receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of the patients were reported, the majority of patients from the medium phenotype and only one patient proved the severe phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an ongoing expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for a Open-label extension study, where she received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazi-treated patients compared to the placebo group, a improvement of lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open renewal study, an improvement and / or excitement of this effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The acceptance of the expected percentage of FEV is not significantly significantly and the absolute lung volumes increased more proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepinhibition of treatment reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of the GAG mirror in the Harn (µg / mg of creatinine) was determined until the study remained constant.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation, the clinically significant changes in the 6-minute test test, was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">There was a one-year-old Phase 2 study conducted mainly the safety and pharmaceutical inetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were enrolled at the time of their recording into the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the heavy duty form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four cases, the dosage for increased GAG- mirror in Harn in week 22 was increased to 200 E / kg last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a magnitude growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-score for these age group (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with severe contamination form, while older patients with severe contamination form only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study tests were carried out on the dynamic effects of various Aldurazyme metering schemes to the GAG mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">Once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be demonstrated in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be recommended to take a supplement of the Multivitamin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamine absorption (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a one-maldose Amiodaron was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a lower acceptance of the Amiodaron Plasmaconcentration camp.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hang together with the pharmaceuticals effect of medication, because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal reactions were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The Frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of the known side effects, which were identified after the market launch of Orlistat, is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">4. it is plausible that the treatment with alli to convert in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal adverse reactions can result.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multi-doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days, without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of the reported cases of orlistat-overdose, no side effects or similar effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on humans and animal, from a quick reformation of systemic effects, which are attributable to the lipasar mentions of Orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect continues in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by kovalente Binder to the active Serin-rest of the gastric and pancreatic light.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials was derived that 60 mg orlistat was taken three times daily, the absorption of about 25% of the food.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied to chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (like Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by an additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">With chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">With chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were no vomiting (153 out of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 out of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued an approval to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. an approval for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with severe chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one before chemotherapy given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colorectal passage, patients should be monitored with anamnesty laws or signs of a subacute Ileus according to the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful with the same gift of Palonosetron with drugs which extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is prolonged or that of such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Besides in connection with another chemotherapeutics gift, Aloxi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy neither for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not tumble tumours of five studied chemotherapists (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose Palonosetron and a steady-static concentration of oroclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based in a population based on a population of CYP2D6 inductors (Damodaron, Celectron, chloretidine, dioxetine, dioxetine, rangeal, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies should not be applied, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women, unless it is necessary to be considered necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms to observation side effects (a total of 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and obsolation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of oversensitive actions and reactions to the appointments (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar courses presented themselves by unwanted events such as in the other dosages; there were no dose-efficiency relations.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis however probably did not have effective therapy at an aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients were compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of Dolphosetron (half-time 7.3 hours), who received intravenously every day 1 without Damethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 mcg of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron that were given in day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetoed chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials to indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the Ionenknization and Reposarisation levels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EKG effects of i.v. administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations of a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally used in the entire dose range of 0,3- 90 μ / kg in case of healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, which ranged between day 1 and day 5 measured medium (± SD) increase of Palonosetron Plasmaconcentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetical simulations, that at once daily intravenous gift from 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days in total exposure (AUC0- ∞), with which after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg measured values, however, the Cmax after the publication of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated over the kidneys, and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolic lines compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for Metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and the CYP1A2 and CYP1A2 participated in the metabolic ism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron made an unchangeable active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single-time intravenous Bolusinjektion, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function, the terminal elimination measurement time and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions, considered sufficient over the maximum humanist exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, claims that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionenko, which are involved in ventricular deisation and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (every dose should be given in about the 30fold of therapeutic exposure to humans), led to a higher frequency of liver tumors, endoophysac, pancreas, annierenmark) and skin tumors with rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and da Aloxi is destined for one-time application, the relevance of this results will be low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2672">In addition to this study, the study enrolled in the study to evaluate the drug a immune response (i.e. the body is antibodies against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (one with crucistenosis) and small inclusions maids (Riss- or chipper), diced and seeded wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections which are proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo is not working against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients with the age of nine months, but with patients under 18 years, the treatment surface may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should check the patient once again and check alternative treatments in pathogen.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works through block of bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of bacterienzelle, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The primary indices of efficacy in all five studies of patients whose infection was deferred after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients filed under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected hood, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates showed: if the results were taken together with skin hours, about 90% of the patients were enrolled in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo was found in the treatment of Abszessen (eitfully filled cavities in the body tissue) or by infections which have been proven or probably by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effects of Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation of the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo was transferred to the risks of the following surface treatment: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, dediced or inclined wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission adopted Glaxo Group Ltd. an approval for the placing of altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement within two to three days, should be considered once again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a Sensibilization or severe local Irritation due to the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is cancelled, and an appropriate alternative therapy in the infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where MRSA is known as a pathogen or is thought (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary studies, the effectiveness of retinapulin was caused by infections with infections which were caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is supposed to be considered as a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected point.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to small plasma concentrations, which were reached in humans after topical application to the poor skin or infected wounds, a clinical-relevant inhibiting in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol increased the medium Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on the poor skin of healthy adult males by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to patients, dosisadjustments are not required for patients if topical retinulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of effects to the birth and the redals / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be applied during pregnancy when an topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the application of Retapamulin is the gift of an systemic antibium.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In case of decision whether the breastfeeding was continued / terminated or the therapy with altargo should be completed, is between the benefit of a nursing for the infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials in 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most frequently reported admittation of Irritation at the appointment site that was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active stapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a certain binding point of the 50s of bacterial Ribosom, differs from the binding of other ribosomal intersectional antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">The data indicates that the binder of ribosomal protein L3 is involved in the region of ribosomal P-binder and peptidyltransfert centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binder on this binder inhibit Pleuromutiline, peptidyltransfer, block partially P-binder interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retapamulin should appear in at least some infection forms, a consultation should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulates insensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virus factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a study with healthy adult was placed 1% Retapamulin ointment daily under occlusion on intact and put on skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds have been gained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sample preparation took place 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the median and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording at humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 shielded skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP shirt.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The Metabolism in vitro oxidative Metabolism in human liver microsomes was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, under a lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms of the treated point are to terminate the application of altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Apply no other salben, creams or lotions on the surface that is treated with Altargo, if it was not expressly accepted by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It cannot be applied in the eyes, on the mouth or in the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases, which concern the liver) for children aged between 1 and 15 years, who are not yet immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two doses of existing vaccination, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, the Ambirix may only be used if the immunisation exists a lower risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the two doses of vaccines can be led to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">For a collection dose against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Invaccines may work by the immune system (the natural body of the body), "how it can be weaving against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "strange" and generated antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine vaccine for Twinrix adults and the Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indebator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed one month after the last injection a protective antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine is compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, appetite mangel, pain at the injection station, tube, matness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may react in patients suffering from allergic (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic) react, not applied.</seg>

<seg id="2739">The idle diagram for the Grundimmer with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given to the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection-vaccination is used for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with corresponding monovalers vaccines or with a combined simp material.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not completely secured if immune individuals who have addressed to an Hepatitis C vaccination as protection, because they may also be protected by the immune memory by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of vaccination, corresponding opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard dimmer is recommended to combine 360 ELISA units-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with disruptions of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS-antibodies resulting in these cases the gift of further vaccination may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal Impairway, this injectors should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In these cases, Ambirix may not be injected by Thrombozytopenie or blood disorders, since it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix in the second year of a separate injection, tetanus-, azellophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined Masern- mumps (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined masernmumps (DTPa-IPV / Hib), the immune response was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients under immune stimulants therapy or patients with immunity must be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation, the frequency of pain, tube, swingitis, headache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed at previous Thiomerang and preservative vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses is administered to a total of 1027 Impairings at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans-combination image.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher Frequencies of pain and mat on a calculation basis per vaccines Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% of the subjects after the gift of a 3-cans-combination image.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination of 66.4% of the subjects, the Ambirix was given, over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects that had been vaccinated with the 3-dose.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matory was similar high (i.e. via the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects, the Ambirix was compared with 36.2% in the subjects that received 3-cans-combined simp materials).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of impregnated pain and matness was small and comparable to the combination of the combination with the 3-cans vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1-11-year-old, the occurrence of local reactions and general actions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that by appointment with 360 ELISA units unactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, with the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a common appearance of pain (at the injection of injection) per dose, is not reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of Impflingen, which covers severe side effects during the 2-cans vaccination schemas with the combination with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B- surface antigen reported, was not statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were carried out during the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the serocondensation rates for anti-HAV 99.1% have been carried out a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, a month 6 administered dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serveraging rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, on the month 6 administered dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to and including 15 years old, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinations of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was evaluated, the seroprotational rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 was significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune answers that were achieved in a clinical study of 1 to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full vaccine series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the Impairfields received either a 2-cans vaccinated vaccinated with 360 ELISA units aininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In persons who were at the time of Grundimmer between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in 0-6 months vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunity reaction against both antigens was comparable to both antigens that made after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination skin, consisting of 360 ELISA units in activated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to and including 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable to immunisation in 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to the 0-12 months vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix in the second year of a combined Diphtherie-, tetanus-, azellularly pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccination (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps vaccination was given, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation was carried out in adults, showed the current formulation of similar seroprotors and serveraging rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible as possible various limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Immunglobulines, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and packs up to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been announced since issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP has the view that the value-risk ratio for Ambirix was positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since the Ambirix only brought in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this product is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with full endothelial Encephalopathy or hyperammonium dusty Encephalopathy) in the pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Amaps will be divided into several single doses to meals - swallowed up, while food is mixed or over a guest stainless steel (through the abdomen in the stomach-leading hose) or a nostrils (through the nose in the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparative study, because amaps could not be compared with other treatment or placebo (a placebo-medicine, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Amaps may also be to appetite, a abnorms acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, nausea disorders, abdominal pain, nausea, stipation, nausea, constipation, skin irritation, inadequate body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) came to the conclusion that amaps of patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle was effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary circumstances" because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this product.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients, with which a complete Enzymes had already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-fixed form (incomplete endothelial form, which is manifest after the first life-month), an indication for the use when in the Anamnese exists a hyperammonic Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with mud dysfunction, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein tolerance and the development of the daily protein intake of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as for herangrowing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Carbamylactic acid or ornithintransponder bamylase, the substitution of Citylin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetic deficiency need to be arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with mud dysfunction, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophaguszera, if the tablets do not reach immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) of sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">The AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congenital heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium refunds and oil formation in phase only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and differentiation of sodium phenylbutyrat takes place above the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore conindexed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous free gift of phenylacate in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neuronal verification and a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed curing of zerebrals synapsen and a reduced number of functional nerves in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted whether phenylacate is divorced in the breast milk, and this reason is the use of AMMONAPS during the nursing time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at 56% of patients at least an unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these unwanted events were assumed that they had not stood with AMMONAPS in connection.</seg>

<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborrowing was earlier almost always infist, and the disease led even in treatment with Peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with its stickening free analogue in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutary), prototyped Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase survival rate as neutered in postpartal (however, within the first life month) diagnostic diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients showed that time with many for intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-proof form of the disease (including female patients with heterozyginal cord-mangels), which were treated by a hyperammonastic Encephalopathy and a protectomy diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible and in some cases a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenol, which is conjugated in liver and kidney levelling with glutamine glutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were identified after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat for sounding healthy adult and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts from orange doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites also was investigated for intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacic.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after the intake of phenylbutyrat were determined.</seg>

<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which have been treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day of oral in three single doses), the medium phenylacetate concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is carried out within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated production of phenylacetylamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat had been treated with toxicity and non-toxic effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either oral (infants and children who can not swallow any tablets) or patients with sluckomial or a Nasensonde.</seg>

<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serumproteins in plasma should be kept within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Carbamylactic acid or ornithintransponder bamylase, the substitution of Citylin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed to phenol in front of the birth of phenylactic acid (active Metabollit by phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid of the Hirnrinde.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood vessels to the heart), for example with instabiler Angina (a form of pain in chest basket with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart failure) without "ST- Hebung" (an abnormal measurement value at the electrocardiac or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">In patients with Angina or heart failure, this can contribute to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS when the effect of Angiox was involved in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different medicines for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-antibodies) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was frequently used a stent (a short tube that remains in the Arterie to prevent a closure), and they received other medicines for preventing blood clots such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">When the ACS was Angiox - with or without gift of GPI - with or without gift of new events (deaths, cardiac disease or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year, as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo one PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin, except severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who are possibly oversensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudine, other Hirudine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be applied to patients who had recently had a blood, as well as people with strong blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is a replacement for Heparin's treatment during the treatment of ACS and a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission adopted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd approves an approval for the placing of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarianmen (instabile Angina / Non-ST-Hebtures (IA / NSTEMI)) for an emergency aid or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is performed using a PCI PCI, an additional Bolus should be given up to 0.5 mg / kg and increases the fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI PCI, the reduced rental dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angigiox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and effectiveness of a large bolus gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI entry is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal drug should be carefully mixed and the Bolusdose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is not necessary, provided, the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with medium-severe kidney failure (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is treated to a PCI (whether with bivalent irudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">The ACT-value is below 225 seconds, is a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg and will test the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdose.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully tested during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bloodess, especially if bivalent is administered in combination with another antibodies (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if using PCI-patients under Bivalirudin most bleeding in the arterial points can occur in patients who can undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while the treatment can occur everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated to warfarin and with bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR-value (International standardisation ratio) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudin once again reaches the level of existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the active mechanism of antibodies by antibodies (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozytensionist) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin with thrombozytenants, clinical and biological hematric parameters are regularly monitored regularly in any case regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are involved in relation to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, integration or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfraction Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in patients with Heparin treated patients were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of unwanted events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined after ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding like in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding occur below Bivalirudine alone significantly less often than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular bleeding or blood pressure required, hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 g / dl without any obvious blood point, reduction of hemodium spiracy of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding station, reoperation due to a blood pressure, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localisations that occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally), "Other" scores, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving Bivalirudin at 6000 patients who undergo one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in patients with Heparin treated patients were more frequent in women as well as in patients over 65 years of unwanted events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occur in Bivalirudin significantly less than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after comprehensive use in practice and are assigned to system organs in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose the treatment with Bivalirudis immediately pressed immediately and to monitor the patient in relation to the signs of a bloodgement.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific trombins, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as to the ionenbinding region of Thrombin binds, regardless of whether trombin is bound in the liquid phase or at Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin in Thrombin, and with its effect, is reversible because Thrombin sows the binding of bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly which generates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudin with serum of patients, in which it came to heparininduced Thrombozytopenie / heparininduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no thrombowel aggregate reaction was induced.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dosis- and concentration-dependent anti-corrosive effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If the patient was conducted in a PCI option, an additional Bolus should be increased from 0.5mg / kg of bivalent in and the fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of ACUITY study, unquestioned Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronarsyndrome (ACS) in patients with instabiler Angina / non-ST-Hebtures (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2973">For adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months compared with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied to patients who are possibly oversensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or one of the other components, or in patients who suffer from a hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicinal products that can work on blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is available as a subcutaneous injection either in the field of abdominal cord or delay by continuous infusion in the field of pancre- and apply subcutaneous in the field of pancre-.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin changes the insulin needs can be reduced by patients with an restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the impact strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insintyps (normal, NPH, deldelays etc), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can draw a change of insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or demolition of a treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-able diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycemia and diabetic cetoazionale; these states are potentially limatory.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or insulin insulin should be made under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of an hypoglycemia depends on the insulin profile of the insulin and can therefore change at the changeover of treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To substances that increase the blood sugar activity and increase the inclination to Hypoglyric acid (ACE) inhibitor, disopene oxidant (MAO) inhibitor, Pentoxifyllin, Propoxyphen, Propoxyphen, Salizylate and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as Betting loosers, Clonidine, Guanethidine and tipin the symptoms of adore counter are weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive diagnosis showed no differences between insuperiority and humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insinglulisin into the human breast milk occurs, but generally, insulin is neither in the breast milk, nor in the breast milk, it will resorate after oraler application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are known for clinical trials, grouped according to system operations (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - silent, cool and bluish skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual bleeding or weakness, confusion, influence of visual acuity, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed the injection of injection within the injection area may occur in the sequence a lipodystrophy in the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglyric cells with consciousness can be given by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which will be treated by a doctor or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine cause for severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar level through the stimulating blood glucose (especially through skelskelmusculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting of Glucosy production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous ga- levels of insulin is faster and the active duration is shorter than for hu- manoeuvinsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes mtus, insinglulisin in therapeutic measurement range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional increase of gluing effects, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional increase of gluing effects, exactly as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin insulin has twice the fast efficiency occurs as normal humaninsulin and achieved complete gluing effects about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident that at an application of insinglulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprandiglycemic control is reached as with human normal insulin, which is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin insulin was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranal control was given as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insinglulisin 15 minutes after the start of meal, there will be a comparable glycemic control as in human normal-insulin, which will be given 2 days before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin insulin at a gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before the start of meal compared to human normal insulin, 30 minutes before the start of meal was given (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin insulin at a gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the start of the meal compared to humankind Nor- malinsulin, the 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
