<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European public procurement report (EPAR), which is explained in the studies as the Committee for Humanities (CHMP), which is conducted by the Committee for Humanities (CHMP), in order to achieve recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information on your disease or treatment, please read the Packet service (also part of the EPAR) or turn to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish any further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets which dissolve itself in the mouth) as a solution to insert (1 mg / ml) and as injection of injection (7,5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. effective thinking and speaking, Hallucinations (listening, listening to sight, which are not present), misery and madness; • bipolar I interruption, a psychological disease, with the patient lack of periods (Periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe episodes and preventative episodes for patients who have addressed in the past in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied for fast control of disturbying unrest or behavioural troubles if the oral consumption of medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases the solution can take the solution for inserting or the melting tablets in patients, which is preparing the swallow of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are using other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripivotzol appears primarily as "partial agonist for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and Dopamine, but in less dimensions as the neurotransmitter acts to enable the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine with schizophrenia and bipolar disturbulation to normalize the activity of the brain, resulting psychotic or lack of symptoms and their reacting is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent symptoms of symptoms were examined in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injectors solution was examined in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases caused by a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared with twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which have been stabilized to 160 patients, with which the manian symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection solution was examined in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disturbance, who suffered severe unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms of patients was investigated by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate, such as the body uses the melting tray and the solution to insert them (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection of injection solutions, the Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms compared to those who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">The application for the treatment of bipolar disorder was reduced to four of the five short-time studies in four of the five short-time studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks for more effective than placebo the re-performing episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered additionally to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses have also been effective as placebo the symptoms stripped and were similar effective like Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal interference (uncontrolled), enzymes, nausea (nausea production), tielhypersecretion (increased spoke production), fatigue and exhaustion (increased storage production), tiredness, Insomnia, Insomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the conclusion of the treatment of schizophrenia and from mid-heavy-severe episodes of bipolar-I interruption as well as the prevention of a new poor episode in patients who had mainly lack of episodes on treatment with Aripivotzole treatment, compared to risks associated with Aripivotzole.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee on the result was that the advantages of injections in the fast control of disturbous troubles and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or patients with lack of episodes of bipolar I disturbulation, if a oral therapy is not suitable for risks associated with risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an authorization for the entry of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is intended for the treatment of standard to severe episodes of bipolar-I- disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly lack of episodes and their lack of episodes on the treatment with Aripivotzol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy at doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With respect to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justified (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides diseases belongs to psychological disorders and affecting psychotic diseases and was reported in some cases after the start or after changing an antibiotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disturbance caused an increased supremacy risk with Aripivotzole in comparison to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripivotzol should be treated with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction), cardiac insufficiency (dehydration, Hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure reduction) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which one year or less continued, there has been occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with ABILIFY treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms that has grown to a mns, or clear a fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotica, including ABILIFY must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "therefore, Aripiprazole should be used in patients with varicum cases in the anamnese or with states that will be applied to be used with clamper." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripivotzol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripivotzol, an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for unwanted vascular events treated with Aripivotzole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoene tin or hyperosmolarem or death was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antibiotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents of patients treated directly.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar manie due to comoddities, the use of antipsychotica, with which weight gain is known as secondary effects and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripivotzol on the central nervous system is careful if Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centralised medication such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not relevant as clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripivotzol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore ought to be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">For CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'Poor ") Metabolism can result the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripivotzol. compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolic agents.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit of potential health benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteasants, do similar effects have and therefore ought to be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered with an increase in Aripipezol- concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodology), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">People should be able to draw their doctor, if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data base for safety in humans and due to the reproductive studies in the animal, this drug may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the possible value is justified by the potential risk for the redus.</seg>
<seg id="60">But as with other antipsychotica, patients should be warned, hazardous machines, including power vehicles, including power vehicles, until they are certain that Aripivotzole has no negative effect.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side listed below are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripivotzol (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was found in patients with Aripivotzol treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripivotzol, and 15.1% in patients with Olanolan therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% was observed in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripivotzol treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo there were significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters, which resulted in any medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine-Phosphokinase), general temporary and physiptomatic were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripivotzole patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Regarding the side effects, which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptosis syndrome, late dyskinesis, and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate supervings were observed with Aripivotzol alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">In fact, no information on the efficacy of a hematalysis case in the treatment of an overdosage with Aripiprazol; it is unlikely that hemordialysis in the treatment of an overdosage of benefits since Aripiprazole has a high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripipezol at schizophrenia and bipolar I interrupt has been mediated by combination of a partial agonist effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor, as well as a moderate affinity for Dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- und 5HT7, to alpha-1-adrenergen and for Histamin-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">During the gift of Aripivotzol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily, a dosages reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor coding, on Nucleus caudatus and at the Putamen.</seg>

<seg id="79">Current values of measuring scals defined as secondary programmes included, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- Depressrates scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was 34% in the Aripivotzol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olander in-controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients showed a weight increase of at least 7% compared with the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of at least 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapists with a flexible or mixed episode of bipolar I interruption, Aripiprazole showed a placebo over placebo over three weeks in reducing symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapist study of 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I interrupt, Aripiprazole showed no overcoming efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two Placement- and active-controlled monotherapies over 12 weeks in patients with a manical or mixed episode of bipolar I disturbance, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed over placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a warming effect that was comparable with lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripivotzol also pointed out 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of many on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manical or mixed episode of a bipolar I disturbed, with or without psychotic activity, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing your symptoms compared to Monotherapy with Lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-time extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, with Aripivotzol during a stabilization phase before Randomization, Aripiprazole showed that in terms of prevention of a bipolar return response, mainly during prevention of a return in Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion of Aripiprazol, which is transmitted by CYP3A4 catalyst.</seg>
<seg id="89">Average Eliminationshale Age is approximately 75 hours for Aripivotzol during an intensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and with almost 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'Poor ") Metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripivotzol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A Population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences regarding the ethnic origin or the impact of the prey on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetist properties of Aripiprazol and dehydro-Aripiprazol was similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different grave liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect as regards the impairment of the liver function on pharmacokinetics and dehydration of liver function, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to withdraw their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security harpoology, toxicity, with repeated gift, Reproductive-stoicity, comotoxicity and to kanoid potential, the preclinical data could recognize any special hazards for the people.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of people, so that they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects of the dosages of non-dependent activation (Lipofuscine pigment accumulation and / or parenchymph cell) in rats at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the average Steady-State-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose during people (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose during people.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholesterol was determined as a result of the failure of sulphate conjugate of hydroxygenic acid in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose when people are based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulfate conjugate of hydroxycyclzol were not more than 6% of concentrations that were detected in the Gall of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed for dosages that led to expositions of 3- and 11fold of the mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of the supersensity actions are calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no problem related to these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a antimicrotubuli active ingredient that supports the interlocking of the microtubuli and stabilizes the microtubines by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a hibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for the vitational interphase and the erotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin transduced the Transcytosis of Plasmathelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies have been demonstrated that the presence of albumin the transport of Paclitaxel has been supporting the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport through the gp-60-album receptor is conveyed and due to the albatal Proteins SPARC (chted protein acidic rich in cysteine), a Paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two single-unblind studies and from 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III study study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>

<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral Neuropathy to the Abklingen to Baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the general-Paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The actual exposure (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel plasma concentration increased to multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a wide range of extravagcular distribution and / or wheat binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced tumours, the pharmacokinetist properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30 minutes of infusion of 260 mg / m2 adraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 A solvent-free Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The cleance of Paclitaxel was higher than after the Abraxane gift (43%) than after a solvent-based Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and ripping coating is reported that Paclitaxel is associated with 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolic (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urulative urine was reduced by less than 1% of the total dose with less than 1% of the total dose with less than 1% of the metabolic rate and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel, which shows an extensive non-renal cleance.</seg>

<seg id="363">The injection can also be made by the patient or his advisors, if they have received an appropriate guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal failure, or in patients who received chemotherapy should always be observed in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl for children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron gel is made, and iron should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who received chemotherapy, or patients with kidney problems, a anemia can be caused by a erythropoietindeficiency, or that the body is not sufficient for the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells, thereby reducing the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell that was associated with a gene (DNA) that it is authorised for the formation of epochin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was accounted for injection in a vein in the frame of a main study with 479 patients suffering from kidney problems, compared to the reference value.</seg>
<seg id="370">All of these patients participating in this study was injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they were either converted to abamed or still receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main Indicator for the effectiveness was the variation of the hemoglobbins between the beginning of the study and the preparation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also laid the results of a study before, in which the effects were studied under the skin speckled seperation with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobbinations of patients were observed, in the same dimensions such as in those patients who continue to get Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continue with Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common tribution of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, occasionally to symptoms of endospongiform encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, steways migraine and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">The seperation may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against epetin alfa or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abortion under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anämiesymptomes and folks can be different depending on age, gender and total disease last; therefore, the evaluation of individual clinical development and disease management is necessary due to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase of hemoglobbins by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) should be avoided over a period of four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, patients can occasionally be observed with individual hemogonal binocities via or under the hemoglobbinism target.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobbinability should be attempting to reach hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobbinum is rising by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the long-term hemoglobbistrate is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epochin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should ensure close meshed to ensure that Epoetin alfa is in the lowest approved dose that is required to control the anemia and anmiymptomes.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance boxes than patients, where the initial anemia is less heavy (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men in the HORIZON-RFT study were randomized to 508 men and in 185 patients the BMD was judged for 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures amounted to 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study by men (study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta was related to the percentage change of Alendronat to the percentage of the lumbar BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment at Morbus Paget of Knock Aclasta was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radiologically confirmed Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2,6times to 3,0fold-specific upper normal value when recording into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledacic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Risedronat once daily during 2 months was documented in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">After 6 months of combined results, a similar decrease of pain intensity and pain was observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as a Responsible study at the end of the six-month trial, were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and 107 with Risedron patients treated at the follow-up study, the therapeutic concerns of 141 of patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 of patients treated with Risedronat treated patients, with a medium duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledronic acid with 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that appeared as dossically.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma tores increased rapidly at &lt; 10% of the maximum value to 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rasches biphase disappearance from the large cycle with half times t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) will probably represent the fast resorption into the bones and the differentiation of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose in urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone fabric.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total-body-Clearance is independent of the dose 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race, or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Zoledronacid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration camps).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by Cytochrome P450-Enzymsysteme is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans, because it is a weak or not a direct and / or irreversible, replaceable inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledacic acid correlated with the creatine cleance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine cleance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in that a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function until a creatine cleance to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adaptation of the Zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney disease (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) are only restricted, there are no statements possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The tallest non-acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and charged 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influencing.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was administered by doses ranging from 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals; a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose which corresponds to 7fold of human therapeutic exposure, corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use of cumulative expositions that the maximum of the intended human exposure occurred enough, toxicological effects found in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as to the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings of studies with repeated treatment was an increasingly primary Spongiosa in the metaphysise of the long bone in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an orbulation that reflects the pharmacological effects of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats you observed Teratogenicity at doses above 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the lower serum-calcium-mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European public procurement report (EPAR), which is explained in the studies as the Committee for Humanities (CHMP), which is conducted by the Committee for Humanities (CHMP), in order to achieve recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied to treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (in particular patients), where metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not displayed. • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition, metformin patients (especially overweight patients) can be applied to patients with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphate resin or insulin, the previous dose of Sulfonylharnfuel or insulin can be retained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar level); this should be reduced to the dose of sulphate resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be used better and the blood sugar level can be reduced better, resulting in type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acettos was investigated in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphate resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycerylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured as well as the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in a lowering of the HbA1c value, which allows to close the blood sugar values for doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional gift from Actos to existing treatment with metformin and Sulfonylharware demonstrated in a lowering of HbA1c values by 0.94% while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin is examined in 289 patients, patients who enrolled Actos in addition to insulin was compared with 0.14% after 6 months compared to 0.14% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were visiondisorders, infections of the upper respiratory symptoms (colds), weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may neither be used in patients (allergy) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic vinegar (high ketones level - acidspar - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapist (in general use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin patients should be shown at which Metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for the integration of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white up to white, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate, and in which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application will not be recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or Ödeme, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and Ödeme, if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome trial with Pioglitazone was performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previously advanced macrovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on cardiac insufficiency, which led to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver values (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal area) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardisation area, the liver enzymers are as soon as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If one patient developed symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, tiredness, fatigue, appetite and / or darker harn are the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should continue until the presentation of the laboratory parameters should be guided by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dossient weight increase was detected, stir from fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a liquid assets.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hematlution occurred among the therapy with pioglitazone, a minor reduction of the mean hemoglobbulation (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobbins by 3-4% and hematokrits (relative reduction of hemogurt bins by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity in patients, the pioglitazone can be used as orally two or triple combination therapy with a sulphurine harlot or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of Thiazoldindian treatment, including Pioglitazone, was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular debit, the possibility of a macular edema should be aware of patients over disturbation of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events concerning bone marries from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated questionnaire was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years, treated with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wish to be a pregnancy, or the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for examination of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon do not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interaction with drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contrativa, Cyclosporin, calcium blocker, calcium blocker and HMGCoA-reducers are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazone in order to increase the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a decrease of AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the result of treatment with Pioglitazone who diminished hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance of maternity and thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the acute growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (derived from this data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the Turgors and the formation of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege appeared on three times the upper limit of the standard area as often as in placebo but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulphate resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome trial in patients with previously advanced macrovascular disease was the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely over cardiac insufficiency is reported among Pioglitazone, however, if Pioglitazone was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of messages prohibits events concerning bone marries from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with groups of treated groups and over 7,400 patients.</seg>
<seg id="796">In over a period of 3.5 years of running Proactive study, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of the patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a reference medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">During taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work on a activation-specific nuclear acceptance (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver -, fat and skeleton cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glucosine appreciation in case of insulin-resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study conducted with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the period until posture of therapeutic effectiveness (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be invoiced by Pioglitazone (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was discontinued despite three-month optimisation phase with insulin inadequate, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared with the patients who continue to receive only insulin; a reduction of insulin-doomed was observed in the group treated with Pioglitazone group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease of the album in / Kreatine quotians were compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, based on type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase of the HDL- cholesterol and slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon was compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazide the total plasmatriglycades and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol while using Metformin and Gliclazid values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride level, but also improved the triglyceride level, this also improved to triglycerid absorption as well as to the triglycerid absorption as well as to the hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome trial, included 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previously untreated advanced vascular disease in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either by Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone will be resorded quickly, whereby the top concentration of unaltered Pioglitazone can be achieved in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV requires the effectiveness in about three times the efficacy of Pioglitone, while the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenol and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactively marketed Pioglitazon in humans the marker was found mainly in the case (55%) and to a lower extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The median plasma-Eliminationshallow time of unaltered Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolic rate is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazone and its Metabolites are lower than in healthy volunteers with reduced kidney function, but the rates of the oral cleance of the mother is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In poisonous studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, according to repeated administration, plasma volume magnification with hematlution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac disease.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the result of treatment with Pioglitazon who diminished hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance of maternity and thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the acute growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family invigous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindices resulted in an increased frequency of Kolontumni.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white up to white, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated questionnaire was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years, treated with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) were treated with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with Pioglitazone or Gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease of the album in / Kreatine quotians were compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone was not only the sober triglyceride level, but improved in addition, the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this both for a effect on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as to the hepatic Trygerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing in terms of their primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly non-fatal myocardial infarisation, leg amputation above the Knuine, coronary Revascularisation and Revascularisation of leg arteries, set the results close that with the ingestion of Pioglitazon no carcardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white up to white, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events concerning bone marries from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who received comparisons with Pioglitazone, showed an increased incidence of bone fraud at women.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was tested in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is not able to use the insulin-effective.</seg>
<seg id="865">After 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycerylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured as well as the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c spiegels that the blood sugar levels were similar strongly as with another humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who probably react sensitively (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses have to be adapted from Actraphane, if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can work on the blood sugar (the full list is to be found in case of packing).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane weigh over risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the placing on the market of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a quick initialized effect can be wished with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the total dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose levels are significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia warning symptoms can perceive and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (detachable insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA compared to insulin-animal origin) can result that a change of dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the switch to Actraphane is required in patients a dose customization, this may be necessary in the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients receiving hypoglycaveric reactions after a change of animal on human insulin showed that the early warning symptoms were less pronounced in a hypoglycaemia or less than with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which go over several time zones, the patient should be noted that the patient can bring to the Council of his physician, as such voyages that insulin and meals have to be taken or taken in other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor should therefore consider potential interactions in the therapy and to inquire any patients after the treatment of these patients.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study was presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, and the application of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Main Indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients who were transplanted after a period of treatment duration of one year (as often as often a new organ transplant or re-absorption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more recent studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined, as Advagraf was included in comparison to Prograf / Prograft of the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who trusts in immunity-intensive therapy and treatment of transplants should make this medicine declassified or changes in the immune treatment therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinical relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft reactions or to an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmune.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients always should always preserve the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage may only be kept under the narrational control of one in the transplantation of experienced medicine (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a changeover to an alternative formulation, therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systematic exposure of Tacrolimus will remain.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based on the clinical assessment of outpouring and tolerability in detail and on blood-level rules (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After changeover from Prograf to Advagraf you should control the Tacrolimus valley level before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion will be controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4, the systemic exposure measured as a valley mirror, with both forums both near renal and transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls in the Tacrolimus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate refresuration phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, a adjustment of the Advagraf-Dosisschemas can last several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the suppression of the transplantation camp must be maintained immunotherapy; a maximum period of oral therapy can therefore not be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplantation prophylaxis of transplantation therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose customizations can be later necessary since the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplantation prophylaxis of transplantation therapy should begin with 0,10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift on the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - transition from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted from Prograf capsules twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to one once daily intake of Advagraf, this conversion has to be made in a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Renal and liver transplantation After a changeover from other immunosupiva to Advagraf a day must begin the treatment with the recommended initial initials recommended for the prophylaxis of transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Cardiac transplantation In adult patients who are converted to a agraf an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day should be taken once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receivers does not exist any clinical experience with pneumonia, pancreas and darfied patients in an oral Initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in a oral Initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in case transplanted dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day to use.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose customizations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining bluttons reflected in patients with severe liver function, a reduction of the dose may be required.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it may be assumed that a dose adaption is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum level inspiegel, a calculation of the creatinine and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporto to Advagraf At the transition from a Ciclosporin- on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is necessary (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood The dose should be based on the clinical assessment of harpouring and tolerability in the case of intruction of full blood-Tacrolimus-Talrolimus inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent inspections of the Tacrolimus valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-valley mirror by Tacrolimus should also be monitored according to the transition from Prograf to Advagraf, dose customization, changes to immune soup-intensive therapy or any use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus full blood concentrations (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, you can customize the dose for several days until the Steady State occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the bottom level was not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talrolimus lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplants in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and transplant patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent creation of liver and cardiac transplantation, blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This led to serious adverse events including graft reactions or other side effects, which can occur in a result of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients always should always preserve the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage may only be kept under the narrational control of one in the transplantation of experienced medicine (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft reactions, which proved to be treated with other immunomoddities, there are no clinical data for the retardized formulation of a agraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft reactions in adult heart transplant and grafts in the childhood are not yet a clinical data for the retardized formulation advanced in advance.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions which lead to a downgrade of tacarlimus in blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of plant extracts (hypericum penetrate) is containing or other plants during treatment with a agraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is commanded, as the Tacrolimus blood level can be subjected to such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf a group of kardiomyopathy was observed chamber or septumhypertrophy, which can therefore occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart disease, a treatment with coroneroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid overloading and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As in other immune soup, the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of maligner skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection factor with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or plant medications that are known as inhibitor or induction of CYP3A4, can alter the metabolism of Tacrolimus, therefore reduce blood values from tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to change the Tacrolimus- blood level with the benefit of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and to adjust the Tacrolimus dose for maintaining equal concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of Tacrolimus with medicines that abolizes the metabolism of CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus reprove the Clearance of steroid-contrativa and thus increase the hormone measures, is particularly careful with decisions about receiving measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus will reduce the cleance of pentobarbital and phenazon and their half-time can extend.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of examinations on transplantationists do not deliver a note that under Tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosupiva an increased risk for unwanted events in regard to the course and the result of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one by the lack of factor VIII below, innate blood clutch).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application must be addressed to treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes bleeding problems in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but after a method produced as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that has been associated with a gene (DNA) that it is authorised to formation of the human odinnate factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a different drug in the European Union called Recombinate, similar, but will be produced differently, so the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of medicines were investigated for prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood vessels with "excellent" or "good" evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are Schwinn, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against the human odinnitus factor VIII, maus- or Hamsterprotein or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG approval a approval for the placing on the market of Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage intake and duration of the substitution is addressed after the severity of factor VIII, after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical status of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma level (in% of the standard or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are solved.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of patients is passed.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment, the dose is enriched to control the dose and frequency of injections an appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and different half times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for a long-term prophylaxis of blood in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmac cannot be achieved or if the blood pressure is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to verify an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures need to be done.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be addressed after the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procodiatory activity of factor VIII directional IgG Immunoglobuline that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, which depends on the risk of genetic and other factors within the first 20 minutes of exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In the treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure times and an amnestic-known inhibitor development was observed, after the changeover by a recombinant factor VIII-product, it was observed (lower titre) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare event of hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs's largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who were all treated with previously untreated patients who have increased risk of inhibitors (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the initial approval of the CHMP, the CHMP has continued the benefit-risk subsidy to be positive as positive, but into account that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">As a result the CHMP is based on the basis of safety requirements of ADVATE, which is required to achieve a single submission of PSURs every 6 months, that the authorisation is intended to apply for another extension of authorisation in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited on the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) officially declared that the company intends to withdraw his application for the entry of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the white parts (tissues, connecting other structures in the body, surrounds and support) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus which has been genetically modified that it can bear a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" which was so changed, that there is no copies of themselves, and therefore no infections can trigger in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and enable the cancer cells to make the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from non-defective in the human body of the p53 gene, usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and killing cells when DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni Cancer, the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells may grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company applied data from a study with a patient before, at the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of undermining, in the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP grants the answers to the questions which had been reviewed, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the testing of the initially submitted documents, CHMP is provided on Day 120 a list of questions which will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">After the CHMP, the injection of Advexin was not enough that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-tumors are advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee had further concerns relating to the processing of drugs in the body, the type of administration and safety of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proven that advanced in a reliable way, and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in ensually contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company put the CHMP not aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changing force release" means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the most effective components is immediately released and the other slowly gets released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergy rhinitis (Grasshoppers, caused by an allergy against pollen, inflammation of the nostrils) in patients with Nasenmucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents over 12 years the recommended dose of aerinaze twice daily is one tablet that should be taken up with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and end, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose mucosa (bundles nose), are diskled.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The most effective measures were the changes in the severity of the Heuvupunensptomes, which were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the locusts of the nose, the patients, the aeropaze revenue, the aerinaze revenue, over a decrease of symptoms by 46,0% compared to 35.9% compared to the patients receiving pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nose mucosa was considered, the patients below Aerine aze a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% of patients who were desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachykarst (cardiac disease), pharyngitis (pharyngevity), constive, headache, fatigue, insomolence (sleeplessness), Somnolence (battles), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may be used in patients suffering from allergic (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephedrin or one of the other components, against adrenerge active substances or Loratadin (a different medicines for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also be used in patients suffering from hypertension (hypertension), cardiac or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyroid (overfunction of thyroid) or have a hortorrhagic strike (caused by a brain blood circulation) or have a risk of haemorrhagic impact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe approval a approval for the entry of aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, it is the whole to swallow (i.e. without breaking down or cut down).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since for long-term application the activity of Pseudoephedrin with the time may take off.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decline in the mucous membranes of the mucous membranes in the upper respiration, treatment with desloratadin can be continued as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin, the drug is also contracted in patients who will be treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetical activity in combination with other vasoconstrictors, such as Bromocrid, Lisurolin, otergotamin, dihydroergotamin, dihydroergotamin, dihydroergotamin or other deconization, phenyl carphrine, ephedrin, Oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient-reflecting and the data is not sufficient to make appropriate recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is not sufficient to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients must be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or a tachykarytonor of palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or etchaive other neurological symptoms (like headaches or a reinforcement of the headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patients: • Patients under DIGITALIS • patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder, or bronchospasmus in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is used at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of dermatological tests, since Antihistamine can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reaction or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazol were given in addition, no clinical relevant interactions or changes of plasma concentration of Desloratadorn were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In case of the results of the psychologist tests, no significant differences were detected between the patients treated with desloratadin and treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratley was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This was not identified for the metabolism of Desloratadin responsible, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The infertility of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since realising studies on animals not always be transferred to humans and on the basis of vasoconsensory characteristics of pseudoephedrin should not be applied in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patients should however be resolved that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impairment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a cNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, dimined spiritual attention, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular disease) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, Hallucinations, Tremor, Convultures) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, disruptions, muscular sufficiency, cardiac disease, thirst, impermeability, nausea, vomiting, relief, preventive pain, dizzy, tenants and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is especially likely to children, as well as Atropin typical symptoms (oral-dried, pluillary and dilematation, hood, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophile as well as the inhibition of expression of the expression of the expression of the hemophenüls P seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an individual dose of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring sizes of the flight performance including the amplification subjective battles or the tasks that are connected with the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, in case of recommended dosage of 5 mg daily, no increased incidence of battles in comparison to placebo was detected.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage may cause further sympathomimetric effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachykarst or manifestations of a ZNS detection.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergienic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients Aeropaze tablets have received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminantagonist effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin via the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets in regard to the swelling effect, determined significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">During a single-dose study on pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is verifiable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze with healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrin was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multidisciplinary study, which was carried out with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects of Desloratley was badly reputable.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components of interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Psighdoephedrin after the sole gift of pseudoephedrin bioequivalent was the exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harology, for toxicity, toxicity, toxicity and reproduction, the preclinical data with desloratadine, however, does not recognize any special hazards for men.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the effects found in general related to the synopdoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">The combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin was the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin with a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged 6 to eleven years the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml Sirup</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of paddling, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were further studies submitted to prove that the body makes the syrup, the solution to insert and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application for children unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">With allergic Rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius to an average decrease of symptoms of symptoms by 25 to 32%, compared to a decrease from 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urtikaria, the decline of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared with 40 and 33% compared to placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, Loratadin or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted SP Europe approval a approval for the entry of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, for the reduction of symptoms in allergic Rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic Rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience of clinical trials for efficacy in the application of desloratadin in young people aged 12 to 17 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of an intermittent allergy rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should terminate according to the previous disease and can be resumed and resumed with their resuming.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In persistent allergic Rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected during clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazol were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, inclinically ingestion and alcohol is not strengthened the most efficient effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, the patients should however be resolved that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impairment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical studies in various indications, including allergic Rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with Aerius, when patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">Most common adverse events, more frequently than in placebo were fatigue (1.2%), oral-dries (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse effect was treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadin and were treated with 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose trial, at which up to 45 mg Desloratadin (nine clinical dose) were administered, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophile as well as the inhibiting of expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of the P seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses, in the Desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day, no statistically significant or clinical-relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc-interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">With a single dossi- study of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring sizes of the flight performance including the amplification subjective battles or the tasks that are connected with the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic Rhinitis Aerius was effective at the reduction of symptoms such as Niesen, Nasencaption and Juckreiz of the nose, itching and rocking of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis in dependence of symptoms can also be divided into intermittent allergic Rhinitis and persistent allergic Rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic Rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic Rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the overall score of the questionnaire at Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius reduces effectively that caused by seasonal allergienic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a further forms of the urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology associated with various forms is similar and chronic patients can be recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is expected a key factor in all urticarial diseases is expected that Desloratadox is also reflected in other forms of the urticaria to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective at the improvement of Pruritus and the size of taddling at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with Antihistamine, chronic idiopathic urticaria was the minority of patients who did not respond to Antihistaminika, from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the jewels by more than 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with desloratadin patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disorder of sleep and the guard, as was measured by a 4-point-scale to evaluate this variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergy rhinitis -population, was achieved in 4% of patients a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no reference points for a clinical-relevant Kumulation after once daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratley, however, was not identified, so that interactions with other drugs will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo, not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibits and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dossier with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fat-rich, calorie rich breakfast) does not affect the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials performed with desloratadine and Loratadin performed preclinical trials, at a comparable degree of exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the toxicity of Desloratadin and by Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies for safety-harology, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity and reproduction, the preclinical data with desloratadine did not recognize any special hazards for men.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains Lactose-Monohydrat, Hyprompt, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains Hyprompt, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light-light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius may be taken independently of meals to the reduction of symptoms in allergic Rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic Rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The open doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are required to support the treatment of a infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory diseases or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis, physical investigations, and corresponding laboratory and skin investigation should play a roll.</seg>
<seg id="1766">For about 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years, desloratadmiration is restricted and experienced a higher substrate burden (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years of age, which is restricted to restrictive, is identical to the children that metabolic syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicinal product contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of a fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorption or a sucrose-isoman insufficiency should not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazol were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, utilising Aerius tablets and alcohol is not strengthened the most efficient effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total hardness of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic Rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius, when patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic disappears when a new trunk of Grippevirus can easily be divisible by humans because people still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system contained the immune system contained in the vaccine of Grippevirus as "physical foreign" and forms antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to form faster antibody in contact with a Grippevirus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, detects the human body as body strange), purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetist Boobs of Ambavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambavir should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistance and the treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bio availability of Ambavir as a solution is reduced by 14% less than one capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg amdetavir twice daily with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 When Agenase capsules can be applied without the reinforcement addition of Ritonavir (booklets), higher doses of asgenase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules amounts to 20 mg amdetavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines at 2400 mg amdetavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteasants were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Genase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data for incompatibility and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose to asgenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function of 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be observed in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase cannot be used simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also substrate the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements, the Johanniskraut (hypericum motatum) may not be applied because of the risk of reducing plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be noted that generic bladder or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to the healing of HIV infection, and that they also may develop opportunistic infections, or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with generic ase does not prevent the risk of transference from HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver interactions with potentially fatal progress.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing restricted liver function including chronic active hepatitis demonstrate an increased frequency of liver function under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other Glukokortiids are not recommended, unless the possible use of treatment is the risk of systematic cortiary effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adniotic function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the adjustment of the HMG Coa-Reduction Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly recommended by CYP3A4, a simultaneous dosing of Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomyolyssen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening effects, like Carbamazepin, Phenomarbital, Phenomarbital, phenyl antidepressants and Warfarin (under supervision of the International norm) are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use this medicine at the same time, Agenase can be reduced to less effective plasma torment of Ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amdetavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contrativa can be changed, however, information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given at the same time with Ambavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on Opiatentssymptomes, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of a toxicity due to the high propylactic acid content of the genase solution, this formulation is sufficiently indexed under the age of four years and should be applied to certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Genase should be placed on duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including proteasant inhibitor, was reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exalterbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to have been necessary for treatment with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with pharmaceutical-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment, associated with metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophile patients (type A and B), which were treated with proteasants, reports on an increase of blood cells including spontaneous cutaneous hematome and hemmarthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of the introduction of a antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an anti-anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an anti-inflamous opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial Aegeology is assumed (including application of Korosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunodeficiency, higher body-Mass-Index), cases of osteonekrose particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width of genase, not simultaneously possess with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also substrate of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Ageneavir may not be confused together with drugs, whose ingredients are mainly associated with CYP2D6 and are connected to the increased plasma level with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin is caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir that can lead to a virological failure and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the plasma plasma by a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects were observed at the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskraut (hypericum penetrate) The serum levels of Ambavir can be abased through the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations (hypericum motatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient participates as the Order of Johanniskraut, the amdetavoural mirror and if possible, add the viral load and add the curisraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nelfinavir is administered with Ambavir (see also Eerirenz).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax against 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ambavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg amdetavir twice daily and Ritonavir have been applied twice daily with efficacy and infertility of this treatment schemes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when amdetavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambavir in plasma, which were obtained at the combination of Ambavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than Ambavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, a narrow monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and infertility of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetical study on the application of algenase in combination with didanosin, however, due to the antisciary component of didanosene, it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and generic ase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, a dose of dose is required in combination with Ambavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with lizard irenz in combination with amdetavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both proteins would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitor and existing limited data may be avoided by Nevirapin the serum concentration of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this drug should be used simultaneously, so Delavirdin is due to be reduced because of the reduced and possibly subtherapeutic plasma glucose.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medication is used together, is careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be made, as an exact forecast of the combination of the combination of Ambavir and Ritonavir is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ambavir and Riphutin lead to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Riphutin around 193%, resulting in a rise in adverse reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, Riphutin combined with genase, will be recommended to reduce the dose of ripenile in at least half of the recommended dose even though there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with generic-genase in combination with Erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma level of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The concurrent use of twice daily dose of 700 mg Fosamphaviol taken once a day to increase the Cmax of Ketoconazol to the 2,69times in comparison to the value, which was observed after 200 mg ketoconazol at once daily without a concurrent use of fosampmur with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs, which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or induction of CYP3A4, can be used together with genase, possibly to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be associated to toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines when used in combination with genase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteins, it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as Agenase because it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-volcanic acid that are known as an enzyme (phenyl toin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with amdetavir can lead to a pathric plasma of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channels like Amlodipin, diodidipin, sedidipin, anodipine, nididipin, Nijmepin, Nisoldipin and japamil can be increased by Ambavir, thereby increasing activity and toxicity of this drug may be increased.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with generic bladder can significantly increase plasma concentration and with PDE5 inhibitors in connection with side effects including hypotations, visual disorders and primapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg of fluorticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily) increased over 7 days to the subjects, while the endogenous cortisol climbed about 86% (90% reduction interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Thus, the simultaneous gift of genase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these Glukortiids, unless it weighs the possible benefit of a treatment the risk of systemic cortiary effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-Coa-Reinductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which depends heavily from CYP3A4, are pronounced increases the plasma level with an early administration of algenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaids of these HMG-Coa-Reinductase inhibitors can result in myopathy including a lihabyolysis, the combined use of this medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations of up to stabilization of mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with the benefit of Ambavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenase may not be applied together with oral Mizzolam (see section 4.3), while in case of an early application of genase with parenteral Midazolam is careful.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteasants indicate a possible increase in plasma cutting of Midazolam around 3- to 4-feet.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon is administered with amdetavir, the patients should therefore be monitored to Opiatentssymptomas, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical default, no recommendation can be given, as the amonavir dose is given at the same time when amdetavir is administered simultaneously with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With an early gift of warfarin or other ortic antibodies combined with Agenase, a reinforced check of the INR (International normality ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contradiction is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods are recommended to the recipient.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the benefit of generic bladder (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful defending of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk activating rats, Ambavir-related substances were detected, but it is not known whether Ambavir is transferred to breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study on impaired rats, which was administered in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding time of Ambavir, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during nursing time.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including Fertility and Reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The infertility of Agenase was studied in adults and in children 4 years of clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the patients connected to the genase-side effects were slightly up until moderate, early in the early stage, and carried out rarely to the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are used in connection with regard to asgenase or any other at the same time as HIV treatment or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned side effects date from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which he did not pre-treated patients 1200 mg algenase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated in connection with the study medication, and were performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as under treatment of medical laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) with HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and the soviate fat collection (bullets).</seg>
<seg id="2009">At 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons, which were treated with Ambavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a medium duration of 36 weeks, was observed only a case (bulky) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, with 245 NRTI- previously treated patients under Ambavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 patients (11%) compared to 27 patients at Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin envelopes were usually slightly until moderate, erythematic or makulopapulous nature, with or without juckily and occurred spontaneously within two weeks, without knowing the treatment with Ambavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonekrose were especially reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of the introduction of a antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an anti-anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an anti-anti-inflamous opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">At PI's treated patients, the 600 mg of generic disease were observed twice daily with low dosional Ritonavir (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4), patients who received generic rgenase together with low dosional Ritonavir were frequently performed.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdosage, the patient is observed on signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary support measures are required.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and prevents the processions of viral gagile and gag-pol- polyprotein levels with a consequence of education, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was tested both in acute and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) from Ambavir is found in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute cells and is 0,41 µM in chronic cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibiting of HIV-1 replication in humans is not defined yet.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamper / Ritonavir-dosages - like with other Ritonavir booastically treatment schemas described with proteasants - the mutations described only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of fosampr twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure up to week 48 were examined, with 14 isolates genotypic could be studied.</seg>
<seg id="2022">An genotypical analysis of the insulation of 13 of 14 children, with which a virological failure in the 59 included patients were included in the treated patients, showed resistance samples that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, L32Q, L32Q, M36V, M36V, I3V / M / V, I62V, A71V, V82A / I, I85V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and their extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamper avir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) performed in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following proteasant mutations on:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance evaluation, Genotypical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protector inhibitors insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm defined as the presence of Mutations V32I + 147A / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I82A / C / F / F / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with a increased phenolic resistance to Fitonavir as well as a reduced probability of an virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions for the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to any additional data, and it is recommended to attract the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypical resistance-based analyses clinically validated analysis systems can be used in conjunction with genotypical data on the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protector inhibitors insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clinically-phenotypical Cut-offs (partitions) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpretation results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Ambavir associated genetic pattern creates a certain crude resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the crude resistance between Ambavir and other proteasants for all 4 Fosamper rar resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients, a resistance against Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insomavir), fiquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 insulates), Saquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 insulates), Saquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 insult) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 insult).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Ambavir retains his activity against some other protector resistant insulating agents; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the insades.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a sinuous therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries who can affecting the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the efficacy of algenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidy (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with an PI, mainly with a lower Ritonavir "boostert," received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with downstream virus sensitivity to genase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the study study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI Group in the Viral last (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, in case of non-underdisease fluctuations from 0.4 to 10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the efficacy of untreated Agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase Solution was administered in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosir Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered within the treatment of therapy with PI pretreated children of the expected benefit of "unborn" Agenase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral dosing, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax against 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with amdetavir (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambavir 12 hours to dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous dietary absorption influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l / kg (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and allows a large distribution volume and a detoxifying penetration of Ambavir from blood circulation in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of active ingredient in plasma, with the amount of unbound Ambavir which represents the active proportion probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of non-bound Ambavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active components in the Steady state concentration in Steady-State during the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore drugs must represent the CYP3A4 induced or inhibitions or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution appropriate if they are given simultaneously with genase (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily Ambonnr exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made of the solution 14% less bioveravailable as of the capsules; therefore, Agenase Solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on a millionth base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Even the renal cleance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the impact of a renal function is likely to be reduced to elimination of Ambavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amdetavir plasma plasma levels comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amdetavir twice daily without a simultaneous dosing of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies with Ambavir on mice and rats appeared in male animals hepatoma hepatoma Adenomes, which spoke with the 2.0 times (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg amdetavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocular Adenomes and Carcinomas was not yet resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">In the present evaluation data on humans, both from clinical studies as well as from therapeutic use, however, are not advisable for acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro genital tests, the bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test), mouse-lymphoma test, microcore test to rats and chromosome aberratic test in human peripheral lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by measurement of AST, ALT and activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far, in clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity in patients were observed, neither during the administration of algenase, nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity at virgins, which were treated at ages 4 days, showed up a high mortality rate in the control units as well as with Ambavir treated animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systematic plasma exposition, significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosing was observed, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and low-grown skillary changes were observed, which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 When Agenase capsules can be applied without the reinforcement addition of Ritonavir (booklets), higher doses of asgenase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules amounts to 20 mg amdetavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines at 2400 mg amdetavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be observed in patients with a weak or lighter liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening effects, like Carbamazepin, Phenomarbital, Phenomarbital, phenyl antidepressants and Warfarin (under supervision of the International norm) are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Genase should be reduced to duration 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk for a Lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with pharmaceutical-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment, associated with metabolic disorders.</seg>

<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusionic reactions which are defined as each in relation to the tribution, which occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion of the infusion of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in a reasonable clinical environment, which is immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, we expect to form nearly all patients IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the treatment start.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients, antibodies or symptoms of a infusional condition must be treated with caution when used by Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretical increased risk factors, after an interruption of treatment, after an interruption of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2297">In case of light or medium-severe infusible response, treatment with antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be taken and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate when the response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusible response, the infusion must be stopped until symptoms are reduced to decline, treatment with antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion may be recorded with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the response occurred once again.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate occurred in which the past reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of an interference with intracellular intake of Laronidase consists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments on direct or indirect impacts on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data in newborns which were exponated across the breast milk above the mother's milk, it is recommended to be silent during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were classified as infusionic reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Desirable medicines in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 trial and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with treatment duration of up to 4 years are frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in the history, heavy reactions came out, including bronchospasmus, breathability and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted pharmaceutical effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly severe decline-form and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>

<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 trial and one in the Phase 2 study) showed marginal ginal effects to the enzymatic laronidas- activity in vitro, which did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse events, even if the occurrence of unwanted pharmaceutical actions typically fell with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds of enciration therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the cumulative substrate and the prevention of a further accumulation of the encumance.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly absorbed by the cycle and caused by cells into the lysosomes, most likely about manosis-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled placebo-3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were based on the mean phenotype and only one patient proved the severe phenotype.</seg>

<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomic fact reached 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg Kreatine) was established, which remained constant up until the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients who summarizes significant changes for five efficacy variable values (expected in 6-minute walk, movement of the shoulder-gelks AHI and visual acuity), was generally a decrease in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">An independent phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was investigated in 20 patients, who were under 5 years of age (16 patients with the severe decline-in form and 4 with the middle displacement form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for increased GAG- mirror in the Harn in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and a weight gain (n = 3) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental speed of patients with severe expiration form only limited or no progress in the cognitive development.</seg>

<seg id="2520">It is recommended to meet additional weakens measures, in order to prevent serious diarrhoea in the case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on interaction of medicines as well as in several cases with an early application of orlistat and Ciclosporin was observed a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma plasma plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2522">The Quick values (internationally standardised ratio, INR) could be influenced during the application of Warfarin or other oral antibodies in combination with orlistat (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat were treated with vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta-carotene in the standard range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin parat before bedtime to ensure a sufficient vitamine intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single dose Amiodara was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, which at the same time orlistat received a lower decline of the Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hang together with the pharmacological effects of drugs as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally slightly and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The number of Frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (= 1 / 10,000), very rare (frequency on the basis of the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The prevalence of these adverse events which were detected after the market launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">1. it is plausible that the treatment with alli can result in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days on normal and overweight subjects without having significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">During the majority of the cases reported cases of orlistat-overdoings, no side effects or similar adverse events were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on examinations on humans and animal by a quick reformation of any systematic effects, which can be attributed to the lipasore properties of orlistat.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (like Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as anti-emetry).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group do not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemical therapies, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, a strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy alone (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 out of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">Compared with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued the Company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. an authorization for the placing on the market of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one before chemotherapy given by Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the thickest passage, patients should be monitored by anamnesty decreasing or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful with the benefit of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or by patients, with which the QT- interval is extended or extending to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemical therapists, Aloxi should neither be used in the days after chemotherapy nor to the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies of hemophosetron the five analysed chemical therapists not (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclopein, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady state- concentration of Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarine, doxorubicin, doxorubicin, fluidine, ranitiques, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the cleance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies lie not in front of human pregnancies, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women, unless it is necessary by the treatment doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common adverse events of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least could possibly stood with aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and care pation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of supersensity actions and reactions in the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar skins of adverse events showed themselves in the other dosing groups; there were no dose active relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis probably is probably not effective therapy at a Aloxi- overdocking.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies total of 1.132 patients who received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 cyxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 cyxorubron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of dolphetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received an intravenous day 1 without Daugethasron intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients were treated with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cycloarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of pallonosetron who received 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were randomised to day 1 intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and study with heavily emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indications of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the channels on the ventricular De- and Repolarisation participating Ionic channels and extend the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EKG effects of I.V. administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption According to intravenous gift followed an initial decrease of plasma concentration on an initial elimination of the body with an average terminal half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally disproportionately in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, which was measured at 11 hocarcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured mean (± SD) increase of pallonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Derived from pharmacokinetic simulations that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days, overall exposure (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with the approval of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax after the starting point of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Eliminates about 40% over the kidneys, and around 50% will be converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonist effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolic studies have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower dimensions, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 has participated in Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered active ingredient made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolustion in response time the total mass was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function, the terminal elimingement response time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases a reduction of the dose, however, is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate across the maximum humanist exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical trials indicates that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionic channels, which can extend to the ventricular deformation and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was given in approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans), which were given daily over two years, led to a higher frequency of liver tumors, endothelium Neoplasm (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, triniermark) and skin tumors at rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and because Aloxi is appointed for one-time application, the relevance of these results will be low as for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The holders of this approval must be submitted to the European Commission on the plans for the placing on the market in the framework of this decision approved by the Commission.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative reference to the approval of the approval of hepatitis C which was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon has a biological medicine named Rointerferon-A with the same general practitioner, which is already approved in the EU (also called "reference value").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease progressing).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue transplants is further increased, and the values of the liver enzyme alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data before, prove the comparison of Alpheon with Rointerferon-A (active structure, composition, purity of medication, efficiency, safety and efficacy at hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference value to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment (i.e. no signs of virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distributions of this document is Authorised for non business operators only, the EMEA region. what were the greatest concern that the CHMP grants to the recommendation for placing on the market?</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns are reported that the data to the stability of the active material and the drug should not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C which talked to the treatment of Alpheon and Roferon-A were similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon flamed the disease in more patients more than at the reference value; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test was conducted in the study test for the examination of the question, where the medicine forms a immune response (i.e. the body is antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (one with a crucifixes) and small inficated Lazerations (rissor or cut-up).</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not used for the treatment of infections, which were detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this kind of infections may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient and remove alternative treatments to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It acts through block of bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of bacterienzelle, where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main Indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was expelled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients were treated under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates showed: if the results were taken together with skin irritation, approximately 90% of patients of both groups were treated to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, Altargo is found in the treatment of wasteland (eitful hollow ceilings in the body tissue) or by infections, which were proven or probably caused by MRSA, not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common tributary with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the client.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections from the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, depreciation or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. an authorization for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients, with which no improvements could be demonstrated within two to three days, should be considered once and an alternative treatment can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a Sensizeal or heavy local disritation caused by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is aborted, the ointment is carefully fished and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection has begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where MRSA is known as a pathogen or is thought (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies in secondary operations, the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections, which caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if a 2- or 3-day treatment is no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentration based on human use, a clinical-relevant inhibitor should not be expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg cetoconazol increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on the diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low system exposure to topical use in patients, dose customizations are not required to be applied when topical retapamulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a Reproductive distribution according to oraler taking and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the reddish / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the application of Retapamulin is to prevent a systematic antibiotic system.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding continued / ends or the therapy with Altargo / ends, is between the benefit of the nursing for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was applied, the most common adverse events of Irritation had an appointment of about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">The Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus (earlier Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on a selective inhibitor of the bacterial protein synthesis on a specific binding at the 50s underunit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal sinaggerating antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the cobosomales protein L3 is involved and in the region of ribosomalen P-binder and peptidyltransferasecentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connecting to this binding station hemmed Pleuromutiline the peptidyltransfer, block partly P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler subjects.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be determined based on the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Retapamulin at least some infectious diseases should be advised by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the insate is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-responsive to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulatory factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily under occlusion and raised on the skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording on humans after topical use of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolic ism in vitro oxidative Metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under the lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro check on genmutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats micro-core test for in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither by male nor female rats for female fertility at oral dosing of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which makes up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest exposure of human exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2)</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were detected at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure (see above), development tools (reduced body weight) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the approval must ensure that a pharmacovigator system, as in the module 1.8.1 of the application order will be presented (version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holders of approval for the market will be obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmacovigma activities, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which will be agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human use" for human use, the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated point, you should end the application of altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Don't forget any other ointments, creams or loons on the area that is treated with Altargo, if it was not expressly agreed to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be used in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the Salvation is visible on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice, if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After the fixing of the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterilization association or a gazecover, unless your doctor has come to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in aluminium tube with a plastic cap, which contains 5, 10 or 15 gram of salt, or in a aluminium bag, the 0,5 g Salbe contains.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambient is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (sickness, which affects the liver) in children between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix will be applied within two doses of existing vaccines, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, which can be ensured from two doses of the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a review is desired with hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines may work by preventing the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as it can do against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and creates antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the Twinrix adult vaccines since 1996 and the vaccine vaccine for Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect against the same diseases, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered within three doses of existing vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six-month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the patron of Ambirix was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, appetite, pain on the injection station, tube, mat (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may now react sensitively to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologetic s.a. permission to the public transport of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard diminable plan for the plan dimming with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, the first dose at the appointment of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the initial dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a review is required for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, it may be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HbsAg) antibodies observed in the same size order as according to vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet completely secured whether immuncompetent individuals who need on a Hepatitis B vaccination as protection, since it is possibly protected by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As in all injections, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standard dimming scheme is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B Surface antigen contains.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemoralysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, an adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies is achieved so that in these cases, the administration of other vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could result in the gluteal muscles to a suboptimal Impairway, these injection detours should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenie or bleeding problems, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneous in these cases, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix in the second year of a separate injection at the same time, tetanus-, azanophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or combined with a combined measles vaccine, the immune response was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients below immunoscisient therapy or patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, rocking, swelling, matologist, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable with the frequency, which was observed at former Thiomerang and preservative vaccine vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines Ambirix was administered to a total of 1027 Impairings at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants from 12 to 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher skins of pain and matures on a calculation basis per vaccination of Ambirix, but not at a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects had been administered, on pain, compared with 63.8% of the subjects who were vaccinated with the 3-dose.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Matcha was not comparable (i.e., above the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% of the subjects who received the 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and matory was small and comparable to achieve the combination of combination with the 3-cans vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- up to 11-year-old Impflingen, the occurrence of local actions and allergy actions in the ambient temperature was comparable with the 3-doses combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, the 6 to 11-year-old man was reported a common appearance of pains (at the injection point) per dose, not per subject.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of Impflingen, which above severe adverse events during the 2-cans vaccine schemas with the combination of 360 ELISA- units formalise the combined hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were carried out at Impflingen at the age of 1 to 15 years, were the seroconsion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconsion rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, which was carried out with 12- and including 15-year-old, 142 two doses have received two doses of Ambirix and 147 with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 people whose immunogenicity rates were evaluated (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose impulses significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunity, which were achieved in a clinical study study at 1 to 11-year-olds a month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the Impflinge received either a 2-doses vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units. ininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in 0-6-month vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction observed in this study was similar to both antigens that according to vaccination of 3 doses with a combination simpler, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0,5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study with 12- and including 15-year-old showed that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies resulting 24 months after immunisation in 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life with the review of a combined Diphtherie-, tetanus-, acellous polo-vaccination (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles-möttle vaccination is enough, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults, showed similar seroprotations and seroconsion rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is available both before and after resussion by eyelids at any foreign particles and / or physikalisch visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2780">If you are infected / your child before the administration of both vaccines Ambirix are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus (though you are not yet unlikely to feel unlikely or sick / feels) may not prevent the vaccination of a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections which cause the liver damage or symptoms, which are similar to those of hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed.</seg>

<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will give you your child from an vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective substances per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccination with reduced content to an effective content is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection against the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix people who suffer heavy bleeding disorders caused by the skin and not weakened in the muscle. • if you are not weakened to a disease or treatment in your / its body's sake, or if you / your child becomes a hemoralysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these people can't be sufficient, so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction is on vaccination.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambirix should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible as different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be given at the same time or just before or after a injection of Immunoglobulines, it is probably that the response to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix pregnant or breastfeeding women is not administered, except it is urgently necessary that they are vaccinated with hepatitis A as hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction on Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of data, which has been announced since the initial approval of the market, the CHMP has positive the view that the value-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Because Ambirix was only associated with a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to small patient exposure.</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that amamaps in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle to high ammonium values can be effective.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonition was admitted under "extraordinary circumstances" due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval, only limited information on this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use of all patients will be indexed in all patients with a full Enzyms in newborns (within the first 28 life days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-definite form (incomplete tail-defective, who is manifested after the first CV), there is an indication for use if in the Anamnese exists a hyperammonic Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to kill tablets or for patients with sluckily, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually tolerated taking into account the protein tolerance and the development required daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose is sodium polyphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg and in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">For patients who suffer from an early-maniyphosphate casylase, substitution of Citadlin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetic deficiency must be arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallow disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulcera if the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) of sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with contrasted cardiac insufficiency or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium realities and oil formation only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolic and differentiation of sodium polyphenylbutyrat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contracted (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous gift from phenylacate to young rats in a high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) a slowdown of neural failure and a reduced loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebrals synapsen and a reduced number of functional nerves in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be detected if phenylacate has left breast milk in breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS during the breastfeeding time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients were at least an undesirable event (AE), and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A more likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year-old anovic patient, who developed a metabolic disease, heavy hypokalemia, arytytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdosage occurred within a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms continue with the accumulation of phenylacate, which showed an dossional neurotoxicity at an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacate is a metabolic active compound that conjugated by acetylene with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine using the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylometrically is similar to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the differentiation of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium polyphenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is begun immediately to improve survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early release of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infant, and the disease led to death with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticked free analogue products within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the utilisation of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium polyphenylbutyate), proteined kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase survival rate as recently as postpartal (but within the first life of the month) to increase their disease to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-definitive form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygum bamylase deficiency, which were treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet was the survival rate of 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat oxides to phenylacate, which is conjugated in liver and nephew with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyments for soaking healthy adults and in patients with liver cirrhosis, and with liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients with sodium polyphenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cycles or hemoglobbopathic treatment was detectable in plasma after different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium polyphenylbutyrat (20 g / day by in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentration camps on the third day five times higher than according to the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Differentiation The medicine is excreted within 24 hours of about 80 - 100% in the shape of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat treated with toxic and non-toxic doses treated as non-toxic effects (examination 24 and 48 h according to oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is either taken by oral (infants and children who can not swallow any tablets or patients with swallow emission) or a Nasenonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose is sodium polyphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of more than 20 kg and in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular, branched chain amino acids), carnitine and Serumproteins in plasma should be kept within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">For patients who suffer from an early-maniyphosphate casylase, substitution of Citadlin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) of sodium per gram of sodium polyphenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-tles were exposed to the birth of phenylacate (active metable of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid of brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A more likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year-old anovic patient, who developed a metabolic disease, heavy hypokalemia, arytytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylometrically is similar to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to compensate excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of examinations about the differentiation of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium polyphenylbutyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat in granulatform were detected 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">With this approach, the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the mean measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must receive the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved before use in water (the solubility of sodium polyphenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they can not leave the sticky waste products that cannot be excrete after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you have conducted laboratory tests, you must notify the doctor that you can influence AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrat may influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">For taking AMMONAPS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist when you have taken other drugs or recently, even if it is not subject to prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding time you may not take AMMONAPS because the drug could overpass through the breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, flavours, taste disorders, refrescent, desertibility, and deterioration of existing neurological states were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you are looking for one of these symptoms, use immediately with your doctor or with the emergency recovery of your hospital to the introduction of an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute Koronarsyndroms" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable Angina (a form of pain in the breastplate with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebdo" (a abnormal measuring value at the electrocardiac or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who continue to undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion may continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with Angina or heart failure to maintaining blood flow in the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at the treatment of Angiox in sole gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (a different antibodies) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a lock), and they received other drugs to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">At the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without gift from GPI - the prevention of new events (deaths, cardiac cases, or Revaskularisation) after 30 days or one year, as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo one PCI, angiox was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, with which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox cannot be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other miludine or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It also cannot be used in patients who had a blood pressure, as well as humans with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd an authorization for the placing on the market of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarms (instabile Angina / non-ST-Hebrides (IA / NSTEMI) in case of an emergency attack or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolting of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is done in a row a PCI, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI requirements, the reduced infusian dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be accepted for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with one PCI is comprised of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of the intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and efficacy of a single Bolus gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If the value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before applying the application and the Bolusdose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney limitations (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to one PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second leg dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is again to test the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which resulted in phase III- PCI-study (Replace-2), which was included in the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudine-Bolus without a dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also for dialysis patients, angiox is indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be redirected 30 minutes after the treatment of the intravenous Heparin or 8 hours after the completion of the subcutaneous gift from Lower Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Heavensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hirudine • Active bleeding or higher risk of blood disorders due to interference of hemmoist system and / or irreversible bacterial Endocitis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysecular patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully selected during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anti-antibodies (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if using PCI-patients under bivalirudin most bleeding may occur in patients who occur in a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), during treatment of principation everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated with warfarin and treated with bivalirradiation, a surveillance of the INR-Werts (International norm rates) should be applied to ensure that the value of the treatment with bivalirudine should be reached again before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanisms of anti-agulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics, thromboolytics, or thrombozyteners), it may be assumed that these efficiencies are due to increase blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudine with thrombocytic aggregates or anti-globular clusters, the clinical and organic hemostic parameters are regularly control in every case.</seg>

<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfracate heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the treated groups in women and patients over 65 years were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined in table 2 according to ACUITY and Timi.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding was significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>

<seg id="2919">Both in the group of Bivalirudin group as well as patients treated with Heparin-treated groups over 65 years were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding was significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above have been reported after extensive application in practice, and are summarized in table 6 according to system organs.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdosage, treatment with bivalirudine is immediately break immediately and the patient close to the signs of a blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox includes Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombins that binds both at the catalytic centre and in the anionic region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or on Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirmudine in Thrombin, and thereby its effect, is reversible because Thrombin snored the binding of bivalirudine-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, resulting in regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirmudine, serum of patients who came in the past to heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) was induced.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin shows an dossi- and concentration-dependent effect that is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In case of patients below one PCI was done, an additional Bolus of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudine should be increased and the infusion is increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treating adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, injected the upper thighs or upper arm or used as a continuous use of a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin on the blood glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or does not process the insulin in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from humaninsulin and the change means that it works faster and a shorter duration of human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body does not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, Apidra was investigated in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main Indicator for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance glycerylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7,60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin-pro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% of human gestinsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against insulin pulisin or one of the other components, or in patients who suffer from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may need to be adjusted when it is administered with a number of other drugs, which can be used on the blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH an authorization for the placing on Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal ceiling, or for delay or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Glukoneogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin demand, the insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the efficiencies, the stamp (Her- Steller), the insulin delay (normal, NPH, interest-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or manufacturing method can withdraw a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or the termination of a treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycemia and a diabetic canvacia. these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changeover of a patient on another insulin type or insulin at any other manufacturer should be done under stringent supervision and can make a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of a hypoglycemia depends on the efficiency profile of the used insulin and can therefore change to conversion of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To strengthen the substances that increase blood sugar activity and increase the inclination to the hypoglycemia (ACE) Hemmer, Disopyramid, Fibrate oxidant (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, propoxypha, salicylic and sulfonamid-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of Sympatholytics, such as bedding, clanidine, guanidine, Guanethidine, and tipin the symptoms of adrying counter should be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive stools showed no differences between domestic and human rights in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin deulisins in the human mother's milk, however, insulin has not occur in the breast milk, but it is resorated according to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are those of clinical trials known to those who are unwanted (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare:</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycheese with awareness can be given by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an intravenous person, or treated through an intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose projection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine cause for the severe hypoglycaemia and similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin in efficiency occurs faster and the duration is shorter than hu- manem.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin showed insulin-relevant gluing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glukosan effect, exactly like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast active ingredients such as normal human insulin and achieved the complete gluing effect for about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was evident that at an application of insulin pulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postpic glycemic control is given as with human gestinsulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin was applied in 2 minutes before the meal, there was a better postgraduate control than with human gestinsulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control as in human gestinsulin, which is given to 2 tends before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
