a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can specify if enough space is available , or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rectangle can occur . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the label in the rectangle .
in case of stage algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ ap should normally be kept , that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this target will not always be kept . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the square is square .
as spl@@ itting the area of a single entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains . here it is possible to divide the surfaces such as square . the best methods include lines , columns or rec@@ ir@@ sive second .
you can set the minimal dar@@ ed area for an entry about the menu entry view . instead , a cat@@ ching pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry , in order to view that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; fs@@ view was designed ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets thought that the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind was developed .

met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data provided information on or a documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I want to claim more than 1000 photos on your computer , you &apos;ll need to find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not know how many photos you don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ plug . if you don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ plug , you will use very fast search and secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know what you need to do in your system structure . your image files must be organized somehow to your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network run &amp; etc ; please make sure you need to switch to a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly on your site . if you do have enough photos , then you will be using sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then you will then use a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as pro@@ ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing sim@@ pler . split new from old files .
the split of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or un@@ derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to enable Met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ al . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database by selecting the appropriate point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what if you want to change what if you want to change ? in addition , the met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attri@@ bute is available . these are of course the most important .
now start the real work , since you should select every photo of the words , describe and ass@@ essing a review . of course you can select all the images that you need the same attri@@ bute . you start the best with the rating or follow @-@ ups . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos .
let us now come with key@@ word , keywords how to continue with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ onym@@ s for the same thing .
when you import kat@@ alog@@ ised pictures from another source with embedded samples , then print &amp; digi@@ plug . automatically the images of the hier@@ archy is no problem and can be easily done by removing a substr@@ ate on another . the changed key@@ words are pursued by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while the sub@@ trees persecuted .
the graphics features like different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very large representation of met@@ ad@@ ata , as each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of the words - the next section refers to labelling or comments on the third important tool to kat@@ alog@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say you this of the landing site of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence of this panorama .
for others consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image to create an interest . if you know pictures you should show a story . remember , the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him to understand the motive that you understand what you understand .
it &apos;s okay if a picture is not perfect when the strength has only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can also use a lot of text , in an inter@@ national@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as a labelling . you can even export your images into the label and / or the title of the Web Gallery system . you need to tell us the story so for the opening of a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train moves the spatial presentation now with light speed .
you can get rid of the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ alization . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can easily read through images with geographical data . you can also export the pictures at the recording location . you can also export the pictures as well as Gall@@ ery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Earth viewer viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a voc@@ al game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice the cop@@ y@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all versions , thus also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when information should be deposited :
author ( Syn@@ onym for Er@@ ger and Writ@@ er ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , it may not be changed once . this field does not support Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
author files ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : linked with the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples for this can be as : employee photographer , Frei@@ alist photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ ging to the author , this also must be completed .
publisher ( Syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify the photo . if the photographer has been working here . if the photographer has been listed here if the picture is a storage photo , then the group / agency will be given the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , although this has no protection against mis@@ use , or change it . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; it will present a module for stack processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kind of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data loss .
to fight the problem in CDs / DVDs and you will not have to be treated for more than a few years . of course you can also find CDs and DVDs in archi@@ v@@ quality . of course you can also find CDs and DVDs in archi@@ v@@ quality . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 this is a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you believe it is in your refresh@@ ment area .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording equipment and they are not much more expensive than the cheaper , but you can write a lot of reliable . it rot@@ ates to the right to select .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for mist@@ akes , even if you have just been written only . therefore , they use an inspection mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of data are only effective data , the rest is needed for the form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection , it is needed by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster , but it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there is also similar applications available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to be able to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ player Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore virtually six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ Player DVD with 8.5 GB . everything about CDs and DVDs was also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good capture device to high quality media in an un@@ propri@@ etary format . also you should watch the media with a description , date &amp; author characteristics and after that protected place . do not forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ ppy manufacturer keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ ppy disk
in brief : dis@@ ks keep the most common fault rate dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error @-@ cause , SM@@ ART cannot termin@@ ate this error . some of SM@@ ART will termin@@ ate this error . some of SM@@ ART will termin@@ ate the error . these are particularly readers and publishing counter . the expected lifetime amounts between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to one power before you have secured the files , but these losses normally have to produce without problems without problems .
while most electric devices are not much enough , these devices can take devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed powers . these can cause serious data loss , hardware devices , mother@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves from the in@@ ev@@ itable loss that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed and remove the rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . do not think that any plug @-@ in strip contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that he guarantees the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also consider that it protects the protection against lightning .
since a over@@ voltage can use every cable to your computer , you should also make sure that all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers represent over@@ voltage guns also included a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these tools are especially designed for not@@ eb@@ ooks and therefore also contain protection for the modem . thus you are ideal for traveling .
while a over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system before smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can result in a loss of indisp@@ ens@@ able data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection against over@@ voltages , these devices can be automatically shut up and down the system . some models allow you to store your data up until the current . if you buy a UPS , you should make sure that they are the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare his security in electricity disorders with the cost to avoid these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think it is possible to keep all cables before you ride into the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as the drive below &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can save any amount of data .
however , in comparison to the hard disks , you are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data about compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online . the professional variant offers you unlimited storage , which should be reviewed in reality only .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . data transfer errors are automatically included by the TCP protocol and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a stored storage . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are required for transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem support and b@@ tr@@ fs at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive are safe .
the worst thing is that nobody said to you if a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered that there is no protection for your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocols is a much saf@@ er data run than the on your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transfer losses because they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems these bugs remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems , you should see in the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems appears to be one of two candidates , which can handle and highly scalable . it is Open Source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that there is soon also for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still used in the alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; yet it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . if not@@ eb@@ ooks are already the proportion of theft 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the mei@@ otic . it is currently limited to a lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there is already no longer sigh@@ ted .
open Source file systems are less vulner@@ able for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is avoided during a sudden break during surgery is higher and a un@@ defined status is avoided before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mist@@ akes are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 bl@@ ending settings of fundamental physical limits . meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and spatial characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in direction of the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the final result rather deterior@@ ated . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats for higher resolutions .
a 750@@ GB hard drive is available today for 100 &amp; euro . thus , make sure that your data is often affected by a data loss . for example , your data is often affected by a plan and test this backup before you are looking for something like the new installation of your operating system , replacing the exchange of boards or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then a day , a flash would be lucky enough when the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft intensity : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or complete house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ isation is always a local storage . bring your security up the stairs to the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already said is a more common reason for a data loss despite the pan@@ ic . if you use a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete data backup . this creates a complete Mom@@ ent@@ ment to two periods : the complete backup and the last differentiation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . this creates a number of snap@@ shots . you can re @-@ use the original status at any time . this backup comes from a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next , with the exception that it is not only trimm@@ ed and not continuing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool which can easily be addressed to your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this approach allows you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you come back up with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for each month . each additional extension should be done manually , after which you have done a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , playback of pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the internet .
so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you are interested in you because you are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table thanks to your nature , you must consider and re @-@ rate everything today . unfortunately , there is no other way than to manage a certain wax . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask ourselves as the current system is back@@ wards compatible . if less varieties you have used in the past , it is easier to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system for reading your pictures , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : once you change your computer architecture , your memory and secure technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay at open standards .
scal@@ ability is the reference pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually the way to enlarge .
let &apos;s go out that you have the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge it onto a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and send it to a new plate :
check out with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but they are not hanging .
&amp; dollars ; d@@ d if = / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 # at the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if a day no software can be read , then you can create them . this task is easier for year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard , but it can save as much more . it is reliable , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can use a relative many administration information , but not as many as you need and a slow compression . this format is to you to save your images .
TIFF was widespread as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is however that this format has been adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open frame format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a handy camera manufacturer D@@ NG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why , in order to replace the X@@ MP technology , to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a identification technology that allows users to create your data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored the XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers put it in front of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive archi@@ ving . X@@ MP fits as it records the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file and the image file is simplified . therefore you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that support the work on a wide range of application and business models . to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI communities , discussions and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard compounds and educational efforts to achieve a far acceptance of met@@ ad@@ at@@ enst@@ and@@ ards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert Roh@@ files to D@@ NG and store this in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
in order to use external programs you can use external programs . if you check the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under the other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , add in m@@ peg , use the contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ plug . in section Adding a photos to an album you will find a description , as you can have already installed on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for impor@@ ting images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use the digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the machine , turn the camera to display mode and turn them . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , the camera tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is manufactured , a distance indicator will appear at the lower end and the pictures of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol of file extension for each file , photos , movies , music etc on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the lateral features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of a single entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file features and the photo information that are internally stored by the camera . a symbol shows that the picture was not yet downloaded from your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available to all information .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remarks , GPS etc of the image . these information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or the picture processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata must not be available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer , is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from all of your camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug . the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are safe in an album before you delete photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the photos you want to download and then download the button . download the button to download as long as you have selected photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is available for download . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug . in this case , the new pictures are selected using a star in advance window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you use the buttons All download or selected , a dialog appears to be displayed in which the photos will be stored in which the photos will be sorted . details on folder sor@@ ting can be found in section My albums . choose the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos of the camera load on the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos you can delete them from the camera . if you want to delete all of you , if you want to delete all the button , you need to select this first and delete it to delete selection .
note that there are no possibility to restore the photos deleted by the camera ; you should not check if the photos were successful in one &amp; digi@@ plug ; you should be carefully delete if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera memory , you should make this much faster than the camera version .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames not especially meaning@@ ful names . the file names are usually deleted after the photos from the camera . this can be meaning@@ ful if you have taken photos of various samples in the same album . therefore , it may be meaning@@ ful to integrate the date and time , in which the image has been done to the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for dat@@ ory under@@ lines . if you use this latter option , a file is created per day .
the options during the transmission opens three further options that are carried out before the photos on the plate are stored . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another data format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M . if you have the option to add the date &amp; time . for further reasons you should read the help of the command time .
if you use the camera file names , you have the opportunity to change the file names in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer to use it .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; for a photo , is displayed below the name , the camera is displayed in preview . their settings are stored and automatically used when you can open the camera window .
digi@@ plug and digi@@ plug ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that has embedded your camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original box , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window .
if your camera has been made information about the date , at which the photo was made available , you can use &amp; digi@@ plug . all images with the same date are loaded into the picture album . all images with the same date are loaded into the picture album . not all cameras can be found in the picture page no@@ met@@ a data you can read what information can be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to change this option . if you want to change this option , use the button extension and select the option based bottom bases at the lower end of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their computer to your camera is the button Download . select the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that can be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you &apos;ll see where the pictures will be highly loaded . choose a folder selection dialog for the camera . choose the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that can be displayed in length and lat@@ itude . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft using automatic recording of the GPS data to cart@@ ograph@@ ing . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and estate agencies you can use this ability .
if you have later forgotten the photo , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users want to locate the place of the photos , it is easy to document the position of the photos of a photos .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical mapping ( manual ) and last via manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit . but there is a few that works with GPS receivers . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
download the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ ak . you need to save this data in GP@@ X format , as it is the only format that is supported by the module to the ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from pictures and from the GPS and cor@@ relate . on the following page you can make the same name &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and lat@@ itude degrees or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the signs of adher@@ ing coordinates , which will be created for instance by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European road types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; try to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings needed to sign up the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ ous ; select the setup dialog box is divided into eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
action can also select on embedded preview or image processing . in order to set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard @-@ did@@ acy and ur@@ ges @-@ legal data . these data will be selected automatically into the relevant IP@@ TC data fields when it is written for downloading from the camera plate . these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ocation is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . these can be named as mentioned photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is an additional description of the author , this also must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this is not the author , if this has been registered for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press ; if the picture is a storage photo , then the group or agency should be the picture available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . thereby , the met@@ ad@@ ata permanently are contained in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ ous ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous ; imported without being lost without being lost .
image acts as embedded as embedded ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the images embedded in pictures . attention : in pictures , those who are already conf@@ is@@ oned are written by the rate of &amp; digi@@ ous .
the page contains all the options for the information displayed if the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is indicated or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . in order to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ plug , you can add file extension to this list and remove any file in one &amp; digi@@ ous ; Alb@@ um@@ Fol@@ der , which has none of these extensions , igno@@ red by &amp; digi@@ ous ; igno@@ red .
the default settings can be reset again by clicking the button Update right from each category .
the settings of the light@@ ness of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be turned on this page to the default values . some pictures have however enabled different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode . if you have any different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use it for fast computers . if you have one , then you can obtain better evaluation results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose this here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and lower areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the picture processing , this picture can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance can be coded as in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia .
with the PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression , which means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TIFF TIFF compressed you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF . it has no influence on image quality since the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is free .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can freely save the loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , the picture processing is only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it has been developed very quickly to a tool for man@@ ipulation your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing .
the standard deviation is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light as the pixels with od@@ d lines . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the camera is used to use the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white level is not set . default is a fixed color balance that was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ cut images in four steps more details in the Spitz@@ ines . for other cameras , this option is igno@@ red .
the default is the top , so the parts of your images are integrated to consider as pier@@ cing white in the settings . use the setting of pier@@ ced white in the settings . at last , use the top quality in various ros@@ es . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the hair@@ y information .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ plug ; and d@@ cra@@ w are trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option you select the option to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you &apos;ll probably need him to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be made later to the image options of &amp; digi@@ ous ; to keep the time for the demo version , you should have con@@ serv@@ atively .
a den@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial speed data , which provides many cameras and the Matrix color pixel is available . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or paint construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives to you : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it was used as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that was used by myself . it creates color scheme on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color of your lenses you can see the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you will be performed during the shell conversion .
one profile transl@@ ates the color information and returns instructions like those given back . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information as the color information from one color space in the others are to translate the colors as exactly as possible .
behavior questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
colour profile folder Sit here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; examined this folder then during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file later .
the colour management screen is an alternative opposite X@@ cali@@ b or arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your images colour@@ less not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be custom@@ ised to the camera manufacturer and model which you are using . not all profiles are produced on the same type . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not contain conver@@ sions at 16 bits of depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are further options like the soft @-@ pro@@ x profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can be back again , because your printer can work a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated , rather than you can rely on blind algorith@@ ms of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obviously what colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together . this response is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is a interface that can support from a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image quality and image processing , which can support &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use and these are then up@@ loaded by &amp; digi@@ plug . these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu and beyond , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the menu below settings .
more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via the K@@ IP@@ I project via ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the manual books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the att@@ aching of the sealing should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image inputs , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other fields turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata , or the lower end of the pictures during the display .
the camera features indicate a list of all cameras supported on the left side . if you want to use a camera which is connected to the computer , make sure the camera is connected properly , switched on and in the image mode . there are currently serial , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field will only be active if you have a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt , specify when you enter your camera .
in order to connect your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer and switch them into the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is shown in the menu of the main menu . if you own more than a camera , you can insert all here .
with the option confirmation dialog for shi@@ fting &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ plug . in the del@@ eting of a photos in an album , you can find further details in the sections of a photos and del@@ etion of a album .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down through &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side bar without rel@@ ap@@ se . otherwise you need to apply the changes with the button changes .
you can also sign the display of the welcome images of &amp; digi@@ ous ; starting to start . this will accelerate the starting process of &amp; digi@@ plug .
the setting at the start after new photos are forced &amp; digi@@ plug . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ous albums . this extended the starting time of &amp; digi@@ ous . this extends the starting time of &amp; digi@@ plug . this extends some out of the base file , ask &amp; digi@@ plug it is intended to delete it out of the database .
various color schem@@ es can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can choose from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be shown below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can view it to view your photos and improve the correction and improvement . image processing can be done by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of preview displays / editing .
the Image Processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of which are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; you are not part of your distribution . other information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in section Image Processing .
a status line at the lower edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current record number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the upper edge and including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly required functions .
the processing functions of image processing change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo before you use the Save or button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should be able to produce a copy of your image before you can change it . you can save them with file saving .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re @-@ restore or use the button button re@@ produce in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change in the photo since the last Save .
virtually any promotion of image processing can be rest@@ art@@ ed or restored . the last action can make you back , by selecting editing and restore operations , choose from the menu .
if you often use this , you should get the short@@ cut ab@@ brevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to restore and ut@@ ili@@ ze C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the return / re @-@ button button in the tool@@ bar a moment , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions are made between also revers@@ ed or restored .
once you start the image processing you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation system in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture r@@ below or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can in the photo in and out in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ er menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : adjust the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can call this in the setup dialog of &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can call it out of the &amp; digi@@ ous window . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture you can print in the menu image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or entire phr@@ ases . all pictures are printed out of your selection . you will only select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Printing . if you follow the assistant , you will need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which is important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation coil , also available in the image processing , and it will be displayed if one of the five riders are cli@@ pped :
multiple Click on the same riders the side@@ bar will appear or disappear again into the edge .
in the labelling view you can enter labelling with unlimited size or add . note the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off and special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling in other applications , you should follow these restrictions .
after you commented it , use either the button user or change to the next picture , the labelling will then be saved .
besides the user button there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , this will always be done when you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the section rating shows a evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ting . it can be used either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard @-@ brevi@@ ation C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . in order to rate multiple pictures at the same time , select this from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field of ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word shows a search box for fil@@ tering the key@@ word , the key@@ word and a selection box with previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ plug .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search phr@@ ase . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many key@@ words .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering the key@@ word in a picture series . if you have entered different pass@@ words , they are stored for quick access .
pass@@ words can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all tags of a picture are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar will be used with their album , - data , key@@ word , and view@@ finder . if additionally a or more sample filter is used from the right side , only the cutting volume of these two pass@@ words are available .
you can also draw and retri@@ eve several pictures in the main screen . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag them from the right side bar and put it on the selection . subsequently a dialog appears that you asks whether you want the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is selected on no key@@ word . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards , a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree were drawn up and then filed . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word is supposed to be set .
this search for changes will take place at each start of the program . you can also use different settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it must be one or his should be , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to which in the database is sought . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already in the database .
you can define an extended search through all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you will need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then follow the knob . see the options as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have primarily adapted to &amp; digi@@ plug ; s specifically adapted .
the reason why you enter a colour@@ less workflow is the pre@@ valent deviation from your camera or scanners , you can reach the colors on your monitor using your camera or scanners . using the colors , you will print or publish the colors that are available from your digital dark chamber .
if the topic is coming to paint management , everyone wants to press what buttons he must press for the results which he wants . unfortunately , color management meets the results of this tutorial on each point of image management . additionally , you should make links with deeper information making your own inform@@ al decisions to make you the desired result .
if your image has been accomplished every six below , then you must not take care of color management .
you can work on a monitor that can be calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( more information please see below )
your only other images are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB der de @-@ fac@@ to standard is .
so if s@@ RGB works well and the life for all that &apos;s easy , why should you use another color space and make sure to make thoughts regarding colour paste ?
a visual example of limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really see is presented at the bottom . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ s@@ is@@ en@@ shaped region , and the colors in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB using some larger colour modes , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om and click on info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to kiss my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the RGB colour space or not you need your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ers , because s@@ RGB works on s@@ RGB k@@ alli@@ bri@@ m . if you are working as the color space of s@@ RGB , then you need to use your monitor to the RGB @-@ standard k@@ alli@@ moun@@ ts , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . use it before you try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , same , automatic and contrast enlarge from the menu correc@@ ting automatic correction automatically try to experiment the best . they will be able to experiment with this effects , which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is sc@@ aled with the entire picture , so the dark point black and the brigh@@ test item is as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ady . this function is often a magical correction for pictures the dark or balanced .
to the same : this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ ance factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram range has the same number of pixels . sometimes it achieved very good results with the improvement of a picture , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracle of a picture or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes color range in red , green and blue channel . they determines the dark and bright border tones , and adjusted the red , green and blue channels to the entire history .
contrast enlarge : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values of all values between . this is only visible with balanced images and may be a good correction for bad photos .
the white de@@ fle@@ ece of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white off of a photos .
the white compensation correction is slightly restricted to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can perform a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can perform white ab@@ brevi@@ ation in the raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction are better .
this tool is based on a white equivalent algorithm that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it with the menu entry colors white off the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side both the original picture can be adjusted as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ ance , then it is enough to click on the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the coefficient of Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , most pixels very small l@@ umin@@ ance values . with a button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , saturation and Gamma . the shade adjust@@ s the shadow details of your photos better or down di@@ mm@@ ing .
An@@ stat with the above checks are used , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then click on the image preview for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of white and white . on this type , the temperature and green -@@ values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white compensation with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed dic@@ ator increases the colours if more than a colour channel of Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . you will be displayed the combined result in white . this will be displayed as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons store as and shop make exactly this . each setting of the white equ@@ ali@@ zer you have set to store this into a text file and later returned .
the button Pre@@ ferences sets out all the filter values again to their standard values and associated neutr@@ als . note that also neutral settings can be found another photo as your original . if you store this , your original image is changed .
you can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the far widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high quality images . this coding needs more plate , computing time and is available only for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ filed . colour ton@@ er can be carried out by the sub @-@ window for the use of color pro@@ filing , you can pull the chapter of color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to make it possible for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always do the same error , and therefore you will always need the same correction . in the manual for the sound correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility of exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects provide you four farms , a solar efficiency effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ ati@@ er also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of which was partially completed and completed the development of the image . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas of dar@@ ker and the colors have been inver@@ ted . the result was a partial neg@@ atives of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase creates a negative image that is not produced on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filters simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a saturation , that he makes a stronger counter@@ effect that makes the colours brilliant and smooth . try it simply , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for daylight optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated fatty colors are also some phot@@ ograph , especially those who hardly find landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the counter@@ edge . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repet@@ itions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures , the filter can over@@ load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to modify the colour con@@ tr@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment with the tools in the menu under colors . all your ad@@ ings can be satisfied in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you get a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the converted problem : a good saturation . even in this case , the tool is to increase saturation instead of increasing . all changes you can view it in preview . if him do the result , you can confirm the changes to O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ ite / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction for improving the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ ders . specifically the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graphics of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s , three sli@@ der can be clicked on the picture and the left hand represents the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to control the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the knob and make sure that the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left hand , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram is dominated by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images the vast areas of a constant color is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic scale of useful is useful .
three knob : the top for the dark tones , the medium for bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , commonly called Gam@@ ma@@ ids .
the three color@@ im@@ pet@@ tes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used in order to evaluate the output values for example . the compression of the output values can be used for example , while using something different in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , the image values will be set automatically depending on the intensity values of the picture .
store as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system are stored and later charged later . in addition , Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will automatically be adjusted for all sh@@ adows , medium and solar sound . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original version of the Hist@@ o , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ äle .
the option covers all color channels to find over@@ exposed Pixel and gives you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side the half of the original and the target screen is indicated . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
modifications channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the module :
in addition to this til@@ ting there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logical view . for pictures which have been recorded with a digital camera , usually the linear mode of a constant color produces a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will continue .
for example , if you move a shor@@ tw@@ ave to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that this bright tones can be correspon@@ dent with dar@@ ker sc@@ iss@@ ors and corresponding to the corresponding pixels of a dark .
on the preview of the original photos you can see a red mark on the range you want to change a matching line on the turn , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it down to your taste until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . every curve that created you can be saved in the file system and later charged . the file format is the Gim@@ p short @-@ format .
when you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the shadow , central and sunny sound . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option covers all color channels in order to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . here is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Canal . shadow and sun@@ tones became used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied on the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Image Processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the colour sh@@ ady photos .
the channel mixer is a further developed tool to mix the shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be regarded as comparison of your own riders .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for Red , Green and Construction allow you to activate this channels if you also activate the corresponding color components . this is especially convenient when you also use the appropriate color components . this is especially convenient when you also use the appropriate color components . try to reduce the green channel @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color to a visible noise that occur in the same place in the colour channel and whose noise is different from each channel . if that of the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion thereby in which you need to reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer setting can therefore store up to later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option covers all color channels to find over@@ exposed Pixel and gives you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re@@ adjusted . the option is activated under ( 1 ) and the picture shown below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating due to your prec@@ in@@ ability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step where colour pictures can simply be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scen@@ ic images and fits especially well to portraits against heaven . like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) or@@ derly filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates a dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate Mond@@ li@@ que@@ fied at the time of time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) rot@@ ates .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : this creates hot bright and medium tones during a little cold in the s@@ att@@ ain@@ es . this is very similar to the process of a pressure and re@@ development in a se@@ p@@ tic valley . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
digi@@ plug and digi@@ plug ; tool tex@@ tures can apply decorative tex@@ tures to one image .
adding a texture to your image , regardless if it is a color screen or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , an pop portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used to use the image processing .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the registration of the depth or three dimensional characteristics of the texture .
a paper tex@@ tu@@ re@@ ff@@ ective has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the relief of relief is set to 200 .
digi@@ plug and digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added a picture .
the eye of an indication in the limits of a photos is not easy task . a possibility to keep its attention to the image . this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye . under the frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter , you enter the desired frame type for your picture . immediately converted the picture with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button@@ hole and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with pattern .
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original , but the original aspect ratio will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially when you cut the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture of any matter . this is also possible at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . use text , orientation , color from the color space and the character set to adjust . the larger image , the larger must be the character set . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is done .
any setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you enter the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been stored once , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore .
digi@@ plug and digi@@ plug ; Tool Templates which you can put a template on a picture .
the Image Image template use in the image processing can be used to put templates over a picture .
to en@@ cil template , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file format and you should add a maximum compression of the template . whom you want to add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; ma@@ iling list digi@@ plug @-@ Users @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the button folder in dialog . choose the folder where you will notice the template folder . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for templates , a building view is repeated , which automatically reflects the folder of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a folder has been updated automatically .
the preview of three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and change the position of your image .
Enlarge : this button enlarged the displayed picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
resi@@ zed the button : this knob resi@@ zed the lower picture . if you want to use the template &apos;s position . if you want to keep the template on the whole picture , you need to cut the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and put it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply template on your image . the picture will then be adapted automatically .
digi@@ plug and digi@@ ous ; presents three different tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
the shar@@ p@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to be a picture of shar@@ pen@@ ing . in fact , it is not a bit of psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to avoid atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
Re@@ fo@@ kus@@ kus@@ is possibly the best of the three , because he really improved the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in his application and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alised images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this means that sharp edges has to be put together into a common color . this means that sharp edges are printed on paper . SLR cameras will usually need more than normal cameras for the private user .
JPEG pictures often have been applied to a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the shell format must always be used during processing .
some scanners apply a shar@@ p@@ ic filter already during the setup of the image . if you dis@@ able this , get your control over your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by using a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value of shar@@ pen@@ ing . this allows you to correct shar@@ pen@@ ing of the menu .
you should also deal with this , since the results will not work much : the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but strengthened the noise . in general , the usable technique is improved to shar@@ pen@@ ing a picture on the menu entry . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cute . the solution that allows a bit soft to shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool for turn@@ out soft@@ ness and experim@@ enting something with the menu entry . the preview window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter res@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values produce good results and should be tested first . if you make the im@@ shar@@ p@@ est mask to strong , become noise and impression of gr@@ ate in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels that are affected by the filters are affected by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen@@ ed pictures at their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the caught image one of the original is added . this makes the shar@@ p@@ ness of the shar@@ p@@ ness .
the sw@@ elling value is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB value and the difference between the difference . you can therefore define a minimum difference between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauti@@ es errors in mind , heavens and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working image has been applied ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug is focused on the tool and focused on an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright infr@@ in@@ gement @-@ protected design algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ fo@@ kus@@ si@@ er@@ quot ; it is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . it usually uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . it usually takes better results as in@@ bl@@ ur@@ red . you can start using colors Re@@ fo@@ cus@@ a in the picture editing .
in practice the circular split is much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ge &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which are far away from the original pixel pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ge &apos;s folding is even influenced in most cases even very strongly affected by the remote pixels . preventing them un@@ desirable results .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , but then on the edge of the sanctuary .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help poverty . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the room filter can help you reduce Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te . however , values higher than 0.1 is very rare . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue to continue .
Gau@@ ge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts , so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value specifies the size of transformation matrix . if you choose great results , especially if you select large values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the Gau@@ ge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . however , please note that the module should select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any reproduction parameters will be stored for later and then can be loaded later .
try to perform all the cutting , colour and intensity correction on the picture before installing the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately , but they left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; when JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it has to produce un@@ sharp m@@ asked . even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better for processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due on in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods for shar@@ p@@ ec@@ tual structure in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob glass sets the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of the area of the dark , in order to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ ent allows a adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want a blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the picture error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ vol@@ algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as strong points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed electro@@ static p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a smooth gl@@ ass@@ ment on the picture . a value of 0.9 should be checked for details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing must be inf@@ erior . please note that detail , please note the details of the direction depen@@ dency .
angle depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth even in all directions , while a value close to 1 is only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ins or CCD smo@@ kers will create a high value of equal value . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be eliminated at a value close to 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value therefore suitable to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies to larger structures . this is necessary to estimate more than a lot of space , since it &apos;s hard to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , he needs to be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually , here is 1 or 2 .
angle progress &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected , there should be also small . make sure that small angle use a long runtime . you should choose this value so much as possible and for your needs .
integrated stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should avoid the value of smaller than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More of quality that you get through the selection of this option is only small . it doubles , but we recommend it .
the buttons store as and shop make exactly this . any setting of image error can now be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
visual error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can break the calculation at any time with the button down@@ turn .
below you can see how picture errors be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is made in a photo that was done in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is an independent black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad film storage while the journey is wor@@ m@@ .@@ The original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool offers selectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove the sens@@ es from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ ; -@@ Effects of saved images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor space of digital cameras , you can read this tutorial in this tutorial .
the screenshot shown above shows a typical scene showing a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a giant noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the window windows and the sub @-@ window setting can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , ranging from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filters a pixel are moving across the picture and the colour in it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and thus smaller flaws at local currency .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch setting up the filter back to the front . if it is increased , the adap@@ tive filter image details does not need to obtain any more and noise from the level . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and cra@@ ck .
edges : controls the edge precision for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole room can be removed or smo@@ ked . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak pir@@ ates or JPEG arti@@ facts .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the picture . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings does not affect the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to modify either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings does not affect the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas , which typically are stronger , however , it is poll@@ uted the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges are smoo@@ ther . if it is too high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear on the edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set , can be stored into the file system and later charged .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the fixed with ( 2 ) and the noise reduction was applied to default settings .
sometimes a painting is very easy for your purpose . the solution , the image is a bit soft to shar@@ pen@@ ing . don &apos;t use tool for turn@@ out using the menu entry and experim@@ enting with the glass . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools in the most far developed tools to reduce phot@@ graphic files .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ desirable arti@@ facts . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ di &apos;s pir@@ ate , film gra@@ ins , scrat@@ ches , compression standards , scrat@@ ches , compression and subsequently digit@@ alized images , too . the smoo@@ thing occurs along the image con@@ tours and therefore gets the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the error correction is developed with another tool , the error correction was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ oses and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a deser@@ ted compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; - small standards which are displayed in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct this problem .
the buttons store as and shop make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can be restored as a photo with equal noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ zing on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures has been read on an old color photo taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arm that caused by Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ illumination and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Hot@@ pixels allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos using a CCD camera , eight were removed too . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly suitable for high quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file into the assist@@ ants with the button dark image . the tool will recognize the hot and bright pixels that are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel through CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching dark image to correct image . please note that the assistant re@@ members the last dark image and re@@ load this automatically in the next session .
the image field and preview can help you correct within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted up in all invent@@ ories .
select an area around the def@@ ectives pixels on the preview and the results of the filters . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the following filters :
Dur@@ ation : there is an average of the neighboring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel pitch will be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) and then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ectives pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less is moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ectives pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , used . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug error correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , a picture to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , often cannot reduce the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) to achieve the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto objective show under circumstances also this behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should also be used , also with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects arise through movement .
with the large plat@@ ter ranges of today &apos;s fil@@ let and color scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ Filter , which without these filters , the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter is applied to one image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves you can control the vig@@ net@@ ical correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light rein@@ force in the point of the greatest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate a luminous intensity of 2 , or random to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reducing it to a small degree .
leu@@ k@@ thickness , contrast and Gamma settings : the editing of a picture with the vig@@ net@@ ical correction is reduced the lumin@@ osity of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controller must only increase positive values because you need to increase the settings .
if you want a more sensitive re @-@ adjustment of the target image , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the Gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Image Processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a phot@@ ogram and contrast correction was also done with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Lin@@ sen@@ ic distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a ur@@ gy protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distortion . colour distortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gradient is treated by the general geomet@@ ric distortion of lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the picture .
the coefficient of the third gradient has a similar effects , but eight on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of stress correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second place of Gra@@ des . if you combine these two geomet@@ rical distortion , almost eliminate any geomet@@ ric distortion .
in general , this value controls the strength of the distortion second Gra@@ des . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values are cr@@ ushed distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth Gra@@ des . this value appears stronger than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter turned the sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus performs the correction of first gra@@ des due to negative values while positive the image resi@@ zed .
light : this value adjust@@ s brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you get the best filter settings , illustr@@ ating the dialog box with a preview of the distortion . the values use the values for your image are stored and used for the next start as standard values .
the tons and circulation @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all assign@@ ments or size changes . if you have new correction than all the first through . if you have a picture to cut , and then perform a tons @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ se .
to help you get the best correction to you will find this tool a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot . in connection you can correct the tonn@@ age / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion with the help of the lines .
if you corrected a cold distortion is the resulting image black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformers , remove from the image processing or about the zoom knob of this dialog .
for most images the tons @-@ shaped correction are sufficient for some pictures , e.g. photos from front , frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ enn@@ Gur@@ a.@@ org website . the filters re@@ produced the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left hand side of the window you can select the range for a preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can simul@@ ate two parameters of film gra@@ ins and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the gra@@ ding texture of a highly sensitive film simul@@ ate the amount of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of the green green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels for re@@ producing infrared film mix@@ es , particularly the green canal makes it possible to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of infrared fil@@ me@@ ek@@ tes applied on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the displayed picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of A@@ ura in the hair@@ pin .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins like e.g. B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films to increase the manufacturers of large silver gra@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . the treated image gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere of your daily life . if you like this special , Gallery @-@ like , street photo , especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ man photos , you need to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the body . the default value is needed , even higher values are needed , at ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film gra@@ ined effect on a black / W picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
s &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a major protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to affect this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for large pictures . gl@@ ass@@ ment controls the gluten , or from the other side , the hin@@ oc@@ ul@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the image is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and gluten 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon dioxide . therefore , images whose gra@@ dients are slowly change . it is helpful if you choose what scene you choose to sk@@ ate . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two kno@@ bs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controls choose the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast ( gluten ) .
this is an example of the coal @-@ label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving puts your image in 3 @-@ D when it was stamped on wax . it uses an ur@@ gy protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give up your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially good in pictures with a simple structure , in which color does not use the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between paint and intensity to transform the image into a grey , Mongoli@@ an landscape .
depth allows to adjust the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the used image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art work by distortion effects . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : share the image in cells and can look like if it is seen by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distor@@ ted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can stop this effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art plant with infin@@ shar@@ p@@ ness effects . it uses the copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ m@@ ate the picture along st@@ ern@@ al lines coming from a center . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ om@@ end camera and therefore generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radical un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ m@@ ingly the image by rotating the pixels around a core . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ m@@ ingly to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
motion @-@ shar@@ p@@ ness : distor@@ ted the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
soft @-@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ m@@ ingly the picture is soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and brilliant focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , Gl@@ amour photos or add a warm and sub@@ til@@ ting light .
Schüt@@ t@@ un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ m@@ ish the picture by random shi@@ fting of pixels and simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the image and wi@@ dening them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time for calcul@@ ating and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . thereby , there are natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n by copyright protected algorithm .
tropical size allows to change the size of the drops . since the tropical size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image , it is often required to reduce size and density of drop . fish changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Image Processing has a range of free of reg@@ ression . use the tool to set the range , e.g. a face that is free to stay free . if you start the filter reg@@ ression , the area will stay free of reg@@ ression .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the worked picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it by spi@@ ke or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu Transform@@ ations Dre@@ aming or Transform@@ ers .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to increase a photo to a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to ab@@ stain@@ ed is simple . the big question is how you can find a picture of bub@@ bles and details ? how can you be found in a picture ? how can you get the missing information ? how can you get the missing information here ? how can you see a good job here , making it a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it onto the desired size with the tool size . select the size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog box is below .
the tool used to change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to capture the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many image processing programs are using a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . the under@@ lying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you must say to the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
keeping aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio will preserve the original image of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies to larger structures . this is necessary to estimate more than a lot of space , since it &apos;s hard to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , he needs to be higher than 3 .
the buttons store as and loading are used exactly . each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later to be loaded again later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by taking a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to comparison .
the cutting of a photos is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to cut a picture with the mouse simply just the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and put on the rectangle , create . you will see this rectangle then move your mouse during your mouse .
when you start the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus you will get a good overview as your photo into the cut . you can extract the size of the area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . create a new rectangle by simply drag them to the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the push button button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or file Save as in the menu file to store the newly designed photo .
in the field of view , you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains .
in the tool after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or trans@@ verse format . in the high format it is always assigned to the greater value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format of the width .
the tool according to aspect ratio is used . this means it is always equal , regardless of whether you are centi@@ metres , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to make the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation , set .
the tool according to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are displayed as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data can be reflected in the image and not the original image .
the settings of the compositions allow help to create and create your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way to share a rectangle into the diag@@ on@@ als of the diagonal .
golden center : the golden middle is a division established on different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus shell or the bl@@ ender leaves of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all possible things to see you as beautiful .
the golden partition is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to construct your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you create your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number guides from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two previous numbers . the standing divider is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition measures will follow as a visual harmon@@ ious .
the golden center provides liquid aid lines when you create a picture . they are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will get your destination good results for your photos . in comparison to the third party , the golden spiral of the eye can follow the eye along the line of the spiral . this type of composition leads along the line of spiral design and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye can be used in the centre of the composition . this can be a line with or different objects . this is just to guide one line without the eye , it will be ful@@ filling his task .
the golden triangles are also from the above mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not equal to equal triangles . diagonal to these lines can be found a static object of dynamic .
if you use golden triangles in order to break your frame create a effect of professional phot@@ ographic dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach any other .
the options are reflected and vertical mirror can be reflected in order to mirror the harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . on this type , you can custom@@ ize the colour of the lines of your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate any angle around any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens easy to keep the camera straight vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture to fix the camera to an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . choose this file extension and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide is set in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
for your help , the module has a horizontal and a vertical line at your disposal . move the mouse poin@@ ter to position the two lines . after you put it on an important point of the image , you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous sections .
after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is the function transformers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatic cut . choose one of the following options :
the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing sm@@ ooth@@ ed the picture a bit after turning . however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ an transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be re @-@ calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new picture , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new picture , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
right below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjustment of the perspective , the picture will poll@@ uted a little bit dirty . for individual adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after that you have adapted the perspective you have unbe@@ ar@@ ful tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a way to ber@@ some is to cut the image with Transform@@ ations from the image processing .
the tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the upper part into the opposite side . this is no rotation , the image will be distor@@ ted . with other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformers .
note your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners . if you press horizontal and vertically at the same time , you can view the angle to zero . a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the screen .
to help you use a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now adjust the mould tool to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out , the picture becomes a bit of neg@@ le@@ ct . for a single shot this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings generated twice as much as if you should avoid this .
after setting , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate this is the image with transformation cut out of image processing .
digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats , therefore , depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type as these libraries are comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to create a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to the depen@@ dency from other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system . but you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
digi@@ plug and digi@@ plug ; only files in formats to the knows . if the expansion is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the file in the list is displayed . you can change this list of file extension formats &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section configuration you can find further information on this list .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select to use files . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . the redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smooth results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store reliably if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the Roh@@ mer converter from &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section configuration , you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
digi@@ plug ; supports the shop of Roh@@ bil@@ ites only supported by the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported by :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in avi@@ or or MPEG format . however , this formats are produced and is no film processing . if you click on a movie file size &amp; digi@@ plug . if you click on a movie File &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; Settings for playback of movies use the program to start playback .

many tools that require the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; included . their description follows here .
all image processing power tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , turn@@ out , noise suppression , ir@@ ur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture run quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress beam shows the status of the filter onto the current picture . five buttons to change the comparison chart of the prec@@ ept . these modes are :
vertically split without duplic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter used to the right of the selected front panel .
horizontal parts without pressing a duplic@@ ate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter to the area below the selected front panel .
vertically split . the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filters .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filters .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse does not see in advance and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure of exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose a preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the picture and place on the part of the picture from which you want to preview it . preview on the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all adjustment of the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about selected picture and is largely declared . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shoot of the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map search@@ tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move a square . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is naturally ahead of your pictures G@@ eo @-@ data included .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to work of colour pal@@ ettes and to choose colors and using colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only a user . in the latter case you are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Dialog box you can select from a list of the installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color . colour is described under the pallet view . here the colour name can also be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such selection , click the area next to one color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the button Color , the color will be inserted into the cur@@ sor at the cur@@ sor . the color will be inserted either or translate any other ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode allows you to write the check box under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used along with the actions copy , cut and insert .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a tick @-@ line sign if there are three numerical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; inserted .

further required software : &amp; c@@ graph@@ s ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that sets the &amp; graph ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ s . needs to be used in detail :
the main window shows the open graphics , each in a separate window . initially , if you start &amp; c@@ graph@@ s ; without any argument , the tool@@ bar does not open the icon file and open the ( empty ) list of last files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
once you have one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , there is an overview in the corner if the Gra@@ ph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position .
use the mouse bike ( high and r@@ less without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
zoom can be limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below the maximum min@@ ution of a graphics .
when the just in &amp; c@@ graph@@ s ; charged file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re @-@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; c@@ graph@@ s ; it may also notice that later , you can change your decision later , you can use the menu Options ... use , see also .
when you can open a graphic file outside a current &amp; c@@ abri@@ o ; instance , &amp; eg ; in file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; c@@ abri@@ o ; instance , or want to inv@@ ent graph@@ s in a sub @-@ window of the existing instance .
as in the last option you can store your choice permanently , but this will also change with the setup dialog .
in the program start , you can open all Graph@@ s your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also set how the Gra@@ ph should be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely elected .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s that are on a side shall be igno@@ red on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graphic .
watch side@@ car with one on several sides distributed graphite without head@@ line and with another font
the page again gives the possibility to set the behavior when a file changed on hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can upgrade a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or igno@@ red the changes ) or the program every time .
the site closes the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; c@@ graph@@ s ; fixed if a Gra@@ ph will be opened outside a current session . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is required .
the site seat administration is the possibility to set the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; fixed . you can open a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine where to be asked after the start .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates into the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and edit . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF sample of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization are available to loc@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo . height , longitudinal and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ related your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert data to you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of selected images with a GPS track .
choose the images that you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu on . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to download a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to download a track file with GP@@ X file , of course , which contains data from the same time to the same locations , as the images of your camera .
if the file up@@ loaded a automatic correlation , the coordinates must be recorded in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore must be converted to GMT time with the time zone . this can be set up with the time zone .
the maximum deviation for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera @-@ time . the deviation among them will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for images you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then be related all the pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used , if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality , place a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set this bound@@ aries here and then press the knob to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog is to use a call for next , you will only use the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the location can also be displayed with the displayed map and enlarge it . select the appropriate region and enlarge it again until you have reached a suff@@ ici@@ ently precision . the card can always be selected manually , and the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely out of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are options to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module photo gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can choose the albums that are exported as HTML pages . the character set is encoded as HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 .
the module has four riders to be adapted to the settings . the rider &apos;s choice allows you to select all the albums . you will not need this albums . you will need to select one large number of albums on the right hand side . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ schau and the text of the HTML page will appear on the right side of the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this rider is largely declared a gallery on each picture . if you then click on a picture , a new page is opened . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ch@@ show , displayed
the rider &apos;s album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your corresponding pictures . choose a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have chosen JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . this also affects the file size . all other settings are explained even .
the hor@@ semen shows you some of the settings from the album riders for the images that are shown in the gallery , which are shown in the gallery .
a progress window will show the user how far the action is . press off the process to break the process .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ er can be used to convert selected images in a MPEG @-@ video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the Di@@ asch@@ au . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you need to insert the pictures which are packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can start using an ex@@ tras MPEG slide show .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . if you &apos;re using a TV format , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD file , you need to choose the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast of very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave it black . the name and the path of the generated file can be fixed under the name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify a audio file in the name of the audio source file , so it is integrated into the movie . after all the settings can start your requirements , you can now go quickly or enjoy a coffee in all the rest of your computer , and enjoy the Di@@ asch@@ au when you &apos;re back .
if a hint appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can custom@@ ize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Packages on the right below .
the printer driver allows you to print several pictures on a sheet paper in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is convenient to make you better or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can convert your in RAW format stored images in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line @-@ tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original score of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not to get the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RAW file converting to convert and start the module . the R@@ aw image conversion window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now re@@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides , if the camera settings can be used for white or equal . the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and Red / Blue amplifier can be adjusted optimally . if the result is not optimal , you can process the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview you can choose one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG is used a reliable algorithm and produced for the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , reserves all information of your image and use the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you prefer to use your images too or later , you should not use the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality has deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose to JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata file formats are included in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can use it off .
the pile processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image that the best settings are .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is the possibility to automatically write an existing file . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available as far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can put the pre@@ fix , starting numbers and tim@@ est@@ amp .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . you can reduce the image or enlarge it 4 types of image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option to adjust your image to screen format .
non proportional : non proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed for this option .
preparation : prepared the picture for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the pressure resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , Rand@@ om@@ size and background color , is accordingly adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . there is also possible to change the size of the larger images previously . more images can be put to the list of those pictures and place there .
after you started the module , the pictures will be displayed with the selected images . over the button pictures you can add a further images with a file selection dialog . for the last chosen picture will be displayed a preview on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and add them to the list of leading images .
with the button photos , the selected images are removed from the list of the leading pictures .
after you can open all the pictures you can open the new message -@@ Window of your e @-@ mail clients . you &apos;ll need to add here only the addresses and the subject . the pictures are attached as app@@ endix .
do not pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the relevant e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send a lot of pictures when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings of the images . your configuration will be saved and once again used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the GM@@ O Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file the comments on the images are joined together into a text file and the mail is buried .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you do not have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise we recommend you to JPEG format .
if you choose JPEG format file format , select the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the larger images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically with the status messages that can be found automatically at the end . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the knob you can lie this window sch@@ lie ? EN .
after the launch of the Modul@@ s Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions as you want to see your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between you selected and select all images of the album here .

the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left lower corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop allows you to display the presentation in a end@@ setting loop . you can then go manually with Es@@ c ; ab@@ rupt it .
the option shows random@@ ly choose that the images in a random order is displayed . it will not be used the sequence of images in the album .
below delay between pictures can be set between the individual pictures . 1500 millisecon@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should be done so before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses between each transition between the pictures a different effect .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this tool@@ bar , you can hold the presentation and start again to jump to the previous and next picture and stop the dip .
on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file names , the position of the actual picture and the total number of images in your presentation .

the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . you can then see a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by giving only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the Tim@@ eline bar can be seen on the following ways : you can select the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in preview ) and also shows the time line always shown the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate to preview view .
you can also choose a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button and hold the mouse over the ruler of the time line , so the time values , will draw you in preview view only images of this period . you can break the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; B studio album ; provides you two possibilities available to create HTML pages with your images . one is available in &amp; B album ; integrated and the other as module is available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book , the integrated version is described , which can create over the menu file HTML ...
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are described in the three areas of content , layout and finish . in the following table every area is described more accurately .
first you enter the title of the super@@ flu@@ cks and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photoelectric album ; HTML @-@ sample pages you can see an example of this settings .
next , select whether a &amp; B album ; export File can be created , which is to be seen on the review page . n@@ ée information about export files you will find in .
recently , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed without any description . for example , all pictures of a party are . note that all pictures are exported . they cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewing .
in this area you can define as the HTML page will look like . most of the setup possibilities are clear , why it is not done specifically for this purpose .
below the page you can view different resolutions for the images . by this , those who have to view your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures for example , for example , have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer at your site can change the resolution at any time . it can therefore browse your images with low resolution , well as well . if he has shown a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting range , place the different folders and the URL to your site is stored .
best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically supplemented by the next time . this allows you to select a folder or by K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check this really all of the viewer . if you have created a URL for the basic file , the URL that you have created here should be the file . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong file .
if the HTML files created by you have not need to copy them in the final target folder , see how right works you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described options are related to the three to basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ file is created , whose name is set in the output folder .
if you are looking forward to a meeting at a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; a little album ; you can naturally create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , you can get a HTML page for viewing the pictures , recording place , etc . , then you need to make with &amp; B album ; this work must not be done once again .
with &amp; B album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others in your database . the picture teams are impor@@ ting and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you can distingu@@ ish whether the images are stored in file or whether in file it is only a link to pictures . the advantage of all images added together and this file is so independent . the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can choose a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file expor@@ ting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file sear@@ ches the images to two times . first , the images of the URL , which are specified in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is naturally only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog will be described for expor@@ ting images you can read about the menu file Export ... .
the most important option of this dialog box is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are you the following three selection options available :
when selecting the .@@ k@@ im file , you &apos;ll need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option to copy and copy the .@@ k@@ im file , the pictures are automatically copied to you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , just select the export file .
the last option of this page is possible to limit maximum image size . if you do not send your friends images , because the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can limit the size by clicking that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file using the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ting ... select a few clicks and import the export database as described in .
the assistant to import is made up of four steps . first you need to import which pictures you want to import , then in which file the import images should be copied .
it may be that you are the category of persons who is to be imported to the imported file ( if you are a file ) while this category is asked for your database . therefore , you will be imported into the third dialogue window that are to be imported in the third dialogue window , and what categories are to be imported into your database .
in the fourth step you can browse the categories of the data to imported file with the categories of your current database . an example on the picture you can see on the picture .
it must be simple to browse pictures and view : if you look at pictures , you would like to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend you would like to see all the pictures you see on which the friend is depicted .
in this manual you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) to find information on your images , through ( 2 ) the search and see , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adjustment possibilities .
the photo album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual , more pictures have spoken , but often do this also includes videos with one .
&amp; B album ; stores all of its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the upper folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; B album ; noted the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start a different folder with pictures , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start &amp; create a few folder ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ icking album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings can be set up in a window with which you can change to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ direct album ; changing the various setup possibilities in the following section of the user book .
on the left you can see six different icons with which you can setup the setup and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available to the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
in this case you are described , as you can set various properties for each image , e.g. people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
in case you can see the dialogue , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box options you can set up complete members , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in .
in case you can see the setup possibilities that you want to choose the category list . in the left hand side you can select the category . in the left hand side there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; B studio album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ e@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . n@@ ferry informations you find on the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called by the menu modules . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual as it cannot be distributed separately . most modules have a help hand over the modules itself .
since the modules can be used together with different applications , it may be possible to test the modules with &amp; a slot ; therefore you should always use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ g Album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or above the menu . don &apos;t say , I wouldn &apos;t have war@@ ned !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; a little album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; a little album ; and other applications that can use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported by albums ; this kind of order is not supported , simul@@ ates some of the modules the order to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; B album .
there are simul@@ ated &amp; funny album ; the current album , simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture shows .
in addition to the current album , &amp; B album must be handed over and handed over a list of albums . here you go to a record album ; as follows :
when &amp; B studio album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all the people , then each entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set up as a category for virtual albums . if you are using the category for virtual albums , so if you choose to select the category , so if you have selected people to view and to the module this .
since some modules with &amp; B album ; not compatible , you can remove these from the list of modules . start with the setup dialog and select in the modules that modules are loaded .
on the picture you can see a sample for a starting screen once you start &amp; cool album ; start your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see above a menu - and a tool bar . at the moment , we will find no information about your images . in the section we will find no information about your pictures , now , please click on the entry images , which shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; a little album ; is the possibility to see any picture with comments on the picture where the image was taken , etc . you can also set any picture either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if the pictures are depicted on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen were included .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsers as you can read in the section . if you want to see this remarks if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in case you can see three lists with a text box by taking up persons , places and words . these are a very important part of &amp; a little album ; because you will always use it again if you enter information about your images .
the following idea is the shi@@ fting of the pictures within the list : if you are depicted a family party , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are m@@ apped , so that the used names are shifted upward , those people can find faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to list a alphabetical list , click the icon for sor@@ ting to date under the list .
if you have chosen notes for each picture you would like to edit all the selected images , and you have provided this images with comments . click in this case simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture right above .
if you have several images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to select all of these images and apply the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overview . in order to indicate an overview , a special symbol is shown .
in the context menu of the arrival di@@ alog@@ s it is possible to add an entry to a existing or new sub@@ category . additionally , you can also put an entry to a category and add there to an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this is advance that you just need your categories alphabetical order .
you can move the individual elements of the gra@@ zing di@@ alog@@ s by clicking the edges of the frame , click and move . you can also make a new window by adding it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to store the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame as well . if you want to view this window , use the button options ... and then window will see a / aus@@ end . this process will see you in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with image images of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter here . for example , you can see the size of the image pictures by simply plug@@ ging down the mouse with the middle mouse button , follow it simply .
if you like a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture will be set as background picture for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this image is shown in the image . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture gallery . simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete or select either the removing button or choose from menu . now , you will display the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; fun album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . of course you can also use the pictures somewhere else , so you need to record the pictures somewhere . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; cool album ; if not all needed pictures of the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures at which the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pictures are present , so you can see the preview of these pictures . however , you can &apos;t see this pictures from the image .
as you see this function you will find out files out of your folders and copy back into your files . if you want , please do not hesitate to avoid the corresponding CD of your images . if you wish to avoid trouble shooting , please purchase a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with your name privacy . if you want to make a little more privacy , you can see the pictures so that you can see for other un@@ accessible . alternatively , you can see all the images that can see your little sister , control and the menu entry everything except the current view .
thus , you have set what images are hidden in the case of the thread . if you put the laptop now your little sister , you simply select the menu entry images that you have blocked off . if you want to view the pictures , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered for un@@ lock the images . to create this password , simply select password in the menu Privacy .
please consider that this picture protection is not very safe if you can read or delete all images on the hard drive and for the other one can read password as prom@@ pt text or delete . this type of password protection is only for those who are not familiar with &amp; B album ; not very familiar , the view of private pictures .
the reason why you can view all your images with &amp; a little album ; administ@@ er and hours over hours , of course you would like to view it . from this reason , &amp; B &apos;s Album ; on a picture _ and video viewer . you can preview you out of the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but additional all information that you have to enter over the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you can see this simply with the mouse , and you can also configure what information is displayed and if you can see what information can be displayed on the viewer . all these options are available on the viewer . the context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene have selected .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and back by using the buttons picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end jump . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a slide show . then you will run a new picture after a few seconds . how often a new picture can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or Min@@ us button . it is started and stopped by the C@@ tr@@ l button ; s .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s viewer &apos;s album ; it is used to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode .
when you use the viewer , you can simply drag the viewer out into the picture . with the Min@@ us key , you can simply drag the Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be drawn . with the equal button , the zo@@ oms sets the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel corresponds to a pixel screen of the image .
note that the only zoom operations will work with videos that are coming in and out with the Plus@@ and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with screen@@ shots from the context menu you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can end notes to the actual picture with the menu notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can open the image and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name . however , you may only draw the picture to mark and look further images .
a further situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the images on paper . to see what photos you want to start with the pictures and select it as good or bad , while you can view one after the others .
for the two examples above , you will have the opportunity to view images with features while you see . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letters . in the picture you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your images , you can see them in the browser . you can easily print or whatever you have . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you have shown categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can add features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the painting , after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to painting you on the picture .
the brick is not saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can make your common later on .
in this picture you can see a picture on the painted screen . in order to switch on the painting mode of &amp; drop your album ; in order to finish the paint from the context menu . to finish the mesh in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully @-@ rule , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties displayed in the object features and the object in the wire models yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry into the menu Ins@@ ert menu .
there are several possible positions , the following foldable menu will end , so that you can choose the right position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit menu or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click on User to apply these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , you can report any message with a error description . then you can refer to the input error message and retri@@ eve the changes to the application or modify the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Independent View .
press on preview of the selected texture view and a small example of scene will be selected with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is selected , even if you want to be selected a part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen photograph shows the control points of the camera . you can draw this control points with the mouse and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , dis@@ appearing the control points and it will be displayed a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by pulling using the mouse within the entire window .
each object has as wire model a Vis@@ i@@ bility level . you can only specify this value relative to the visual level of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are only shown if they are selected or their viewing stage is smaller or equal to the scene of the scene of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , has a window setting as default . the object tree and view of the object features are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window setting , or if you need a different arrangement , you can also adjust it arbitr@@ ary . you can also save several window orders and easily between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below one view , draw the facade to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
in order to create a new column , draw the facade on the right or left side of a view . the new view will be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , draw the appearance in the middle to another list . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card card re@@ iter above in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to view a view out of the fixing , drag the suit to the top left or click on the little left at the top of the arrow .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the address bar . to prevent the closing , click on the little square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add extra views into the main window . in the menu View , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them on any one spot .
the current window view can be saved with view window order ... save . it will be a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have produced a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the icon Ren@@ ders &quot; icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
a R@@ ender mode is equivalent to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add any amount of running modes , from a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or select menu View modes ... select the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it &apos;s a name that makes the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ ders a small area of the image , select the check@@ box section and enter the image section to the rendering into the input fields .
in combination quality you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features are found in the user manual of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture is rendered by only one beam per pixel , there may be different mist@@ akes . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è @-@ patterns or stu@@ fen@@ ders in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing in order to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , images can look better with this feature .
when switching anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ ile and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is great @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling file extension refers to . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is further divided and adap@@ tive because of calculated colour values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray has to set up a beam of pixels . if the difference between pixel values to the neighboring pixels will be processed . if you are calculated using a specific number of pixels with super sampling , a grid of 4x4 is calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional radi@@ als per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , the pixels will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel which can be pursued individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to ali@@ asing the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the radi@@ als around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the latest setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent if the associated beams have no object .
opens a new window to display the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; choose the menu entry file impor@@ ting ... and select a file from the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently not supported by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when impor@@ ting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window will show a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , write these sources between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ k@@ in and / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the source file in the editor file . to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; c@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can also add the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is a scene . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
when you click on the help in the self @-@ profit view , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler opens &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set here the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( e.g. al@@ ti@@ dd@@ data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files . if a file used in different paths of the library , the first spot@@ ted file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type markings .
you can adjust the object of points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model . you can adjust the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rotating .
larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects like the ball you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you cross high detailed proj@@ ections , all wireless model views are further divided , all proj@@ ections are used with exceptions to the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross a wall there is a wall behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess boards patterns made of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a bottom is below the objects . the floor is illustrated in a chess boards patterns consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you cross the edge detection method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling value can be adjusted . more information about parameters can be found in Section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window window orders , how you can create and store window orders .
the combination field standard window order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of t@@ ant window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the knob and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove .
any window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and cannot be empty .
the list below names shows all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views with button Remove .
the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ edges you will get the window under the existing window , with map card , you will not be an@@ cho@@ red in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , installed and now you would like to start any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all the steps in this tutorial , you should make the ultimate way simple scene under the beg@@ inner : a ball on a plane .
but you should remember the following warning , before you compl@@ ain about it , that you can only use a black screen when you use a 3D program for the first time you should follow these important rules :
if you do not have any camera , no rules for the rendering are applied , as a result , you will get a black image .
if you do not add light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will receive only one black image .
if you have any faul@@ t@@ less installed , you see the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ set window order :
take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation , that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
these menus and symbols are often used now , therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you &apos;ll need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then choose the menu entry berries . thus you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera exam@@ ines the whole scene , which you generate . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire @-@ model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry containing the designation camera . if they click on it , see the contents of the View object properties , in which the various parameters of the camera will find . in user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions , but note that the camera has to change the camera where you can change the target point of the camera . click with the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place .
if you press the button user or the type of input , the wire @-@ model views and object tree immediately change the settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for example . you could set a qu@@ ader ( insertion end@@ point ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a true method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler offers a sim@@ pler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or the type of input . in the object tree the new name will be shown instantly .
the wire @-@ model program now shows the level , even though at the moment , just as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
if you see the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can see the entry for each new object . in this case you will see the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , spin and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get some of these parameters . choose shi@@ fting and set the values as follows :
only select the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit Easy .
in both cases a dialog box opens up in which you can select how the object will be inserted . then you can view the name in the object view ( name = ground pigment ) , with one click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigments only shows a mat black material because you can still enter the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview . you are now able to check the colors for pigment . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way now .
if you are looking in preview no color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button users and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now right now . if you are your image now with one click on the icon you should get the following result :
of course they are not the color . you are expected to have a further settings . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do it more common , but the Schach@@ brett @-@ color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree every time and change the colors in view of the object properties :
this step should you already be able to execute the basic work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler as you have already understood . the ball can be just like the ground :
in view of the object characteristics , you can immediately change the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input ) or push the button to the bottom . otherwise , the ball rot@@ ates above the ground as you move the ground down to a unit down@@ wards .
of course the Ren@@ ders now gives a new result : as already before , the ball point appears like a mat black material . set in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now prove a material as already at the bottom , enter the ball a pigment as a color :
first , choose the first object and change the name for example in ball pigment . click the ball of pigment , then select Ins@@ ert and adjust the values as follows :
but you can reach an interesting effects if you take time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input .
the brightness of shine @-@ effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal is not selected :
you should now have a good impression of what you have &amp; k@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , which offers you . hop@@ efully , you have already learned as much as you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender Method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the Ren@@ derer hypo@@ thet@@ ical rays coming from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like fog can work . so the scene is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , which you look at the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , every scene will need to be en@@ ger@@ ated , some light sources and at least one camera .
the usual file dialog allows you to select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opening a file . in default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler .
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is filed under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage space .
scene in the last stored version is recovered . all changes have been rejected since the last storage capacity .
this menu entry can only select if you don &apos;t have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the most recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only select if you have used Be@@ ads back on site .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the appearance , the buttons and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the scanning technique . you can only change or add instructions with this option for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or new .
opening a dialog to the device of the tool@@ bar . you can add to this option tool@@ box for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; orders and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to isol@@ ate har@@ sh surfaces without any be@@ eh@@ ouse on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump Map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical forms which allows you to use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models are processed then to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by application of a image file as color card .

&amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; is an application for the scan of pictures that do not take more than pictures to sc@@ anned and pick @-@ up .
&amp; sk@@ in@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and storing pictures . &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; can store a dialog for saving or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before storing .
you can check the status of your scanner on the gentle project side by clicking the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ project ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ inn@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for the scanner will be opened .
the user can choose to select the scanner and press OK button to open the scanner . termin@@ ate and termin@@ ate the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not cover these options .
in order to get a picture , the user can start a pre@@ sc@@ can and then choose scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be launched by preview button .
in order to select the image better to select the user in the image and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview of the window will fit .
if the image has been selected then the final image with the scan button can be read .
if you can view a preview of the settings , then the picture will be displayed in a pre @-@ window , as below is displayed , then the picture will be stored and sh@@ lie ? EN leads to a break and you will get into the main window .
with the button settings the same name is opened before the main window . you can change the main settings here .

the D@@ COP @-@ interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly available in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist , playlist , playlist and script ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de . in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check if all the modules are available and use the dialog , allowing the user to run , why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is , for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &quot; # { error } &apos; &quot; exit
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can quickly use them as a basis for your own scripts . you will quickly determine that the writing of scripts are relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; that every K@@ DE installation should be reached .
most scripts allow the trigger of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here an example in Python :
&amp; P@@ arok ; sends noti@@ fications to any current scripts . with this reason , strings to the standard input of scripts are written and accordingly respond to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events even if there is no use for this .
configure the script to view the setup dialog . to store the saving and loading of the setup data each script will take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now retri@@ eve &amp; b ; with D@@ COP functions further information regarding the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ et@@ Change new@@ volume Sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize men@@ stru@@ ctions : Sub@@ menu , Sub@@ menu , Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of the playlist . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Title will also be referred to , so that the script can be used to remove the clicked code script ( Sub@@ menu ) d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu , Sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; run@@ k ; termin@@ ate , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the Signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do . for example , use the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks Script Administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which may recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension of the amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason you should set your script packages right correctly .
the main cre@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be detailed . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i script page by &amp; am@@ arok ; apply for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ arok ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ arok ; has many useful features and powerful features and is still sur@@ pris@@ ingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist , instead of endless menus consisting of thousands in your collection . you may also find a very certain titles of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos; s Colle@@ c@@ els browser and the quick@@ en@@ search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some playlist , you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist is still difficult for you . and if you are still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart playlist will automatically select the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gen@@ eric USB devices . Moreover , many different audio systems can be used , such as you can listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music !

since &amp; am@@ arok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should comp@@ ile no difficulty when you comp@@ ile problems . if you encounter problems , please contact the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; P@@ arok ; has how most applications can enable or dis@@ able some options to activate or dis@@ able the compilation of the available options . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ den@@ cies must be fulfilled in order to be used . details can be found in the system requirements .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help you with the development of &amp; am@@ arok , you should use full .
&amp; P@@ endant ; can be addressed without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple boxes for setting up the various functions of &amp; am@@ arok ; .
player window will turn off the player window in addition to playlist , or when the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
tuning barometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok &quot; has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this option switches the experimental feature of the voting per@@ ometer .
one of the tuning : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok &quot; was compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thus , the used color scheme for the mood activity has changed .
note files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ arok has been compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ Stay files at the location of the respective music files are stored . otherwise it will be stored in the Settings folder by &amp; am@@ arok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / m@@ illed / m@@ ood@@ bar / etc . ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser is created by &amp; am@@ arok ; if a browser is required .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not located in the list .
playlist to save , stores the current playlist , automatically stores the current playlist , and enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist .
relative paths for manually stored playlist , if you activate this setting , it will use &amp; am@@ arok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise it will be the absolute position of music files .
one piece of updates to be visible in the denom@@ ination that the playlist window will be removed / rol@@ lt to keep the current piece in the visible window range .
when changing the context @-@ browser to the context @-@ browser , automatically shows the context @-@ browser as soon as the next one will be played .
the section of the appearance you can custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ arok ; see section is sub@@ part in three parts .
in the fonts section you can select the use of various fonts in &amp; am@@ arok ; otherwise it is enabled in section . you can select fonts for the following areas : playlist , Player windows and context @-@ browser . press on select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom colour scheme , you even set the Qu@@ al of choice and can define their own color scheme . use them directly activated color select for front and background colour .
playing on the start , that &amp; am@@ arok , after programming start automatically with the piece in place , with which they stopped at the last be@@ ating .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to set up on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click outside ... to select the font type for the O@@ SD . the check box reveals that the text in the O@@ SD is displayed .
own colors are you the possibility to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the input field display text is displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to its own needs . below you find a list of available space holder and what they mean .
the screen is designed for X@@ inhibit@@ ama users . thus , you can define , on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio @-@ output audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the select field . some driver will enable further adjusting possibilities in this map card .
the card collection is used for setting up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , select &amp; am@@ arok ; according to Music Files . to select a folder to the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section contains also check@@ boxes to insert , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder re@@ comp@@ elling : this causes that &amp; am@@ arok ; both the crossed and sub @-@ folders can be stored as well as their sub@@ folder to music .
to monitor changes : enables &amp; am@@ arok ; to monitor the selected folders ( e. g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search will be done to make the necessary modifications to your collection .
import playlist : causes that &amp; am@@ arok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ ings and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the added playlist will then appear later in the playlist @-@ browser .
the portion of collecting database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field driver can choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another institution is required in the bottom window .
the MySQL facility is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ arok ; under calcul@@ ator : if the computer is entered , the MySQL database is entered under which the database is reachable under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is manufactured .
use us@@ ername : and password : to insert the data you need to be needed for the database .
the card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ arok ; can transmit the name of played pieces to a load .@@ f@@ m server and create your needs of music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
sending files and so the profile updated : this setting allows it &amp; am@@ arok ; the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar artists call : after activation of this setting will be called &amp; am@@ arok ; a list of similar artists played in each piece . note : you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; P@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K needs only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to install K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to be compiled e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have a small guide on how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD is ahead that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is thus working , but Flu@@ x@@ box will help difficulty . we try to use am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will take an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can view this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org and hang them the kap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly , it is said that Tag@@ lib when reading the Meta @-@ Info from this file crashing . please report this error to the daily Li@@ b developers below bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; am@@ arok ; is something mature .
make sure that all of &amp; am@@ arok libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version . if B. &amp; am@@ arok , with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when working the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate automation . off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ packs by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ drop , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to write a lot of program data as UTF @-@ 8 into the Meta @-@ Info , but not as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; Get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; sold $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module of MP3 : : M@@ compli@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ pli@@ b &apos;
&amp; m@@ arok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repe@@ ating / Dynam@@ ics list ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . this can be de@@ activated in some cases up to three times a symbol that shows up to three times a symbol until this setting has its effect .
if you get this error : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ parall@@ eled icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ um .@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if am@@ aro@@ K used the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ em@@ amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any c@@ erv@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so custom@@ ize that am@@ aro@@ K is the correct version first .
there are some ways . most of the installation issues are on the lightest by means of a professionals from your uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use it to the forum and the I@@ RC at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # am@@ arok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only wear a mistake if you own something on the container of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; appears only a blank playlist . how do you get there music pieces ?
that &apos;s simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window has been converted into the statistic window . you find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has been changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for review by the user while the points will be calculated automatically .
in order to rate pieces , it must be displayed in the playlist and select column evaluation . click somewhere in the new evaluation column to set up the review on a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and choose from playlist from the re@@ side menu .
draw a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would also do it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar the playlist , right next to the Add button , you will save the button playlist . click on it .
probably I lack the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ arok ; newly . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it about the menu bar with ex@@ tras equ@@ ali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real media types does not support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty every only memor@@ able audio format . G@@ streams can even use text and PNG !
it may be ! maybe you are using F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where the default value does not include an MP3 @-@ decoder . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , diabetes
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well so ... &amp; am@@ arok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ streaming driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer . a mixer allows for several applications to use the device to the same time and can be achieved simultaneously via a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . see the support for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem with a solution and a solution . for g@@ amer you need to specify another S@@ ink ( e. g. oss@@ sink ) .
that does not do . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can only look at ALL the best choice if you read a dec@@ or with little overhead . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate sound server using highest priority ( real time value ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next item of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause playback . read this error report . read this error in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help you .
either use not using the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to receive the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts drivers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . depending on the buffer , the less contracts react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to change to the G@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ arok ; why ?
after installation of G@@ stre@@ amer you need to register all the components . perform G@@ ST @-@ register to register all G@@ EM components .
read the g@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask for the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( ending am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then you will start G@@ ST @-@ register as a system administrator , once a system folder of G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ( you will find the module folders with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ Register . launch now &amp; am@@ arok .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; this program bur@@ ns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ Once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ d@@ record ; : bur@@ ns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also choose &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning on CDs . in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality of burnt audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are commonly referred to as a Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is used in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 Decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : an free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read FLA@@ C files and write FLA@@ C files .
dra@@ g@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , nut@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burning them on a audio CD .
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats and to convert . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : one of the function of fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bler and analysis of video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be meaning@@ ful to suit the volume of music files on a standard level . this can be meaning@@ ful as for the creation of mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections . without norm@@ alize the different sample levels of different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces will be different according to the sound .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run by CD and automatically play all videos in the CD file format .
this is a comfortable way to re@@ open projects recently . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has been stored once a file , the previously created file will be asked , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save In will be displayed using the folder and file name for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as you would call for each individual project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what should happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also leave the closing time and keep the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will not ask for any stored project , what should happen , just as you have called for each project file Cl@@ ose .
includes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for any stored project , it will be asked what should be done so as if you have called File Cl@@ ose .
when you call this entry , you can select the file &apos;s dialog for adding a project . this has the same effect when you put the files directly from the upper view into the Project View . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialogue &quot; Bur@@ ning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog for the Project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning process can only be opened when the project has already contains data .
opens the features dialog for the current project . here you can make many projection settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are that ? - Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this is useful if you are not used to use files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be used with even if this function is not used for you , so that you can already see the files using existing files and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function is set to remove &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . these function remov@@ es no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
opens the CD copying dialog . this allows also to create a copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can only use a copy of a CD which you can burn sometimes later . you should also prefer to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this allows also to create a copy of DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn a copy of a DVD to another medium . furthermore , there is also the possibility of creating a DVD with the help of copying dialog . furthermore , the target medium has to be large enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ etion of a CD @-@ RW . so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for the form@@ att@@ ing of a DVD . this dialog allows you to format a DVD ± R ( W ) which makes it completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to write your choice between the typ@@ ing modes and incre@@ mental .
bur@@ ns a previous CD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that is immediately supported by pressing the burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported , but you have to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously built DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which then can be burnt immediately by pressing the Bur@@ n button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content of view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the reading video , co@@ aster settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . these information are displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small bar at the lower edge of the window is indicated . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar will be cancelled .
the folder view will feature an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , the content is shown in the content of view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media Info , spar@@ rows and un@@ lock of the drive .
switches the syn@@ op@@ side of a or out . the content view enables selecting and pulling files into the project view . the content is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , unless a drive selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder of folder .
the head office in the project view is a small area that is only visible when the project view offers open projects . the head office has no real function , it looks pretty nice and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this will open a dialog window to changing the keyboard orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands selected in the upper part , one can further adapt the button assignment below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions are needed to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are needed , therefore you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b can open . here , the settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on h@@ h@@ ie@@ b . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alize and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore rather your taste and the way of your task is crucial , which the programs you want .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; range gem@@ s , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) Cl@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) bund@@ led cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) sold @-@ format D@@ vd ( ) , bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) , bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can generate a D@@ COP reference to the newly created Project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received by # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the top @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface , which is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
the cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) , add@@ ur@@ ine ( K@@ URL : : list UR@@ Ls , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) bund@@ led e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) bund@@ le ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String , name ) key set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b ) cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p / home / tru@@ thful / guaranteed fil@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; check @-@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; with him can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( compressed ) is supported by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) must be added in terms of Linux distribution ) . more co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if installed are installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per tracks ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is compiled by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for OGG ) must be installed ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ders . all these programs are already available for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is not necessary to comp@@ ile it . if FLA@@ C cannot be used , its installation is not required .
what encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter of Wel@@ cher Ko@@ cher gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not possible to read any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is not possible to handle any copy protection ; even not the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup must be made only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , after reading a &amp; CD ; it leads ( hop@@ efully ) to understanding the slim approach of the user interface that you will be proud in the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which co@@ stly programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can get &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands for the orders . on the side step by step example , there are more information as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB on request of the CD @-@ data is based upon request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online ) , in the latter case the connection must be made to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the setup tab in the setup index - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read from another encoder as the default . it &apos;s to be aware that before the Encoder has been configured in tab settings for setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a new file to en@@ code is selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for Program@@ mes ( like reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different card maps ( such as Encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . you have to go before the program can successfully be used !
this chapter describes audio quality , co@@ aster and compression rates and helps you choose the correct co@@ er@@ ator &apos;s choice .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; hormon@@ es &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG mag can have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important because both co@@ ders are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rate .
OGG - if only music is supposed to be heard from a calcul@@ ator or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG formats are available .
MP3 - if music is also available on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these tools can only support the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all the pieces of a title . good pleasure for music by young people , portable devices and aut@@ ost@@ ere@@ als . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments but if you are absolutely absolutely highest quality , but if you want to keep the absolutely highest quality , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , manually entered or by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet are available as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the code program for creating folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with code programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the co@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the key@@ word ( english : day ) add MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt must be added to l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; added the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read / enter information , so that all other information can download and enter the machine . it &apos;s to note that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ nie des U@@ e@@ ber@@ e@@ aster : this is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent them on the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , thus cannot be added to the artist nor to the music company damage . all information can be found in a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address will not be used during the retri@@ eve of the server ( This can only know the programmer which has checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographic on the next sitting mirror server is needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org delivers a current list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for online orders of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( normally created ) only the updates of the database .
which check @-@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , looking at the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package will be installed first if this is not done yet .
to save the converted WAV files , the co@@ ders can be selected and so the desired file format can be selected . during the first opening , defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less comp@@ ressing for audio data ) can be added on the tab . other co@@ ders can be added on this register card .
the Ko@@ di@@ ter package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used . more information on co@@ ders can be found in the chapter of Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information on his switches can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) , it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many reasons . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a hint that is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the she@@ ath of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter by step by step for example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give as you proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , however , are still in@@ secure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to start all and our first &amp; CD ; we will be able to use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 Key@@ words ( tags ) .
you have to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it can be found as non @-@ free software . anyway , it &apos;s not necessary to comp@@ ile the source file , what you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy anything in the cross @-@ sections ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something is thought to be done only once , and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; which must be repeated for each recording &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we specify the code for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy to use the program , we can share the program using the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
even though we can change these settings at any time , we will probably change it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; change when the matching settings are found .
the device name will be delivered to the reading program that can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ Syndrome is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed , so a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card value General settings are not much to do here . here you can define an additional conversion . in our example , everything will be shown so as in screen picture is shown .
only in case of in@@ complete information , please note that you will be informed if information on texts by key@@ word ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so that he can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selective field is sim@@ pler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , when you are in@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , they can easily be changed with the database entry and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to manually enter the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b , if you want to download the database in offline mode , if you &apos;re using the database , you need to check this twice as it &apos;s worth it . to get fre@@ ed@@ b in the open mode , the two selection fields must be selected at least the first . the mode will be set on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the information request , for the retri@@ eve of &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b @-@ server on the internet . how does the system that data will get the CD ? read the section above fre@@ ed@@ b . set all this as it is shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look after a mirror server at your proximity . on this way the load between the host is distributed and this setting will work as first attempt .
both function work as well as many Fire@@ walls of the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there are perhaps more luck to the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we want no &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take the settings from screen photograph . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously ro@@ aring pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with an existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author knows not to try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom files for temporary files : if you cross it , then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored . this is not enabled , the files will not be enabled in the private folder , if you don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files .
all in this way , as it is on screen photograph . the order is somewhat long , under circumstances you need to see anything to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1st &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted on demand . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
do the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously to co@@ iled WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic device of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you choose the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of check @-@ out of the &amp; CD ; we will be able to create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is arranged , because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be retri@@ eved . the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for any type &amp; CD ; it is repeated .
since we are a &amp; CD , which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos will not see a bit differently than the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data can be manually entered , instead of it from the internet . comments will refer to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive on the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD can be identified and identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening , then look for questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b could already be completed , all titles of the pieces are already filled and also displayed by the artist &apos;s name and album .
in case there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; available , a window will be integrated , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion fits best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually redeem this manually by selecting the first button in tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the tit@@ els of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; accordingly to the samples on the next screen , the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ spar@@ ell per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all the songs of the CD .
attention : after the successful departure from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the contents of the CD Ed@@ itors ( e.g. if all words with big letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; this option is set up on the tab tab , throw it a look into the section &apos; Basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ de@@ ers or file formats . see the co@@ aster &apos;s help to obtain more information .
simply select a record , which is obvious with the style of the chosen CD ; this is not important because we don &apos;t miss the &amp; CD ; data is not important . for more information you go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are available at Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Ed@@ itors appears again and you will see that the fields for the album has already been filled with the entered data we just give the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information which you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure for the same way up to all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the product list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles will be selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the unit , or enter the button all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at one time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was launched by clicking on the button selection , this window appears to confirm . click OK , and then we will take a look at the window with orders and track what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
click on the riders orders to switch on the order window . it is available in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program will be displayed at the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you can see this error message if you are trying to work with a co@@ incidence that you have not installed . pieces which have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example . did you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
order 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . but we have a new entry : job 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 to format MP3 . thus , check out and en@@ code in parallel . please note the status of the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the Program@@ mes has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior is the result of parallel networks is the result un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneously read and en@@ code ( however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order in the maintenance length of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er stands . after the last piece is encoded , a small window is integrated with a message for a short time at the upper left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you will need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you know as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions have already been a pre@@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have done it probably ...
this section is directed to persons who compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance if the program needs to be adapted to your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that cri@@ es many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step in order to get the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different card maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu has been clicked on the first @-@ time start of the program , without any contact point like it will continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially when there is no audio CD ; available in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what are these things ? who reads , has already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t count this manual . it is thought to do something like a manual for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; but who can always read anything else or change it . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read it , he has understood this section and is therefore understood with this suggest@@ ion .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need this inform@@ atics but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ es@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; next to others he has worked with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real characteristics of texts that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it is based on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver which is required for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of activity every MIDI channel by high@@ lighting of the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can check out in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( son@@ ograms or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid automatically determined the procedure used .
seat support . if you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , K@@ mid starts again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can select the desired song .
you can also create a file of a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will also fall . this works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a music piece , open it and set the knob finish in the tool@@ bar , select the entry off from the menu pieces or put the Le@@ ert@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you play it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then be played another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive away with the regulator and drive away .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the template . to get the original pace , then click the template to the template .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has played two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button will pause as a pressure on the button break or the selection of menu item in the menu pieces , thus interrup@@ ting the empty clay paste while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play back .
song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use li@@ ed@@ t@@ ance and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , so you will automatically adjust the kar@@ aoke text . you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to adjust a event type , select the settings of text files or son@@ g@@ ings . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which can be summar@@ ised . these are the series to be played in this section , as you can use the collections .
to draw a collection , open the collection manager at first . here you will find the collection of collection under the point .... click here to New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the desired manager .
in temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . consider it if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , they must add a song for collecting managers . once again , you can add a song . once again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends from the setting Automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if Automatic is not activated for the collection , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and re@@ ert . this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song , and then click on Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after playing the menu button , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove any order in the menu , the order will be established .
to play a song , select the collection manager , or use the selection list on kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu pieces or press the right arrow on the right .
to jump a song , select the button fore@@ most , the entry predic@@ table piece from the menu pieces or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection , and click the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter if they are saved during the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create an MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and is always a trumpet , when it was originally a piano .
if you only have one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound@@ cards are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US maps , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
an MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required conditions for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . for this , however , a different text ID has a different text ID ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D of the KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D ( KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; One more Key@@ map ... EN@@ D ) CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that it is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI files .
in this section the patches is stated as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal mark is igno@@ red . it is assumed that the GM patches are currently in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all @-@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds which this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can have a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so , if now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( def@@ ensive elements ) it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in MIDI file .
please note that here , with the term drum patch the patch is meant that every tone is a different percussion instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not that , in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum ( as many keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify such as sounds on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section the sequence of lines is very important , as their availability . they must create 128 entries .
you can define multiple con@@ es for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use several names only in the first row .
Ke@@ y@@ aps are mainly used to form tones on the percussion channel . check out the supplied cone .
this section can be used to make some channels simultaneously . if you want to replace the first and the second channel , make it quite simple in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is illustrated on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map needs to be defined in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are igno@@ red , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case there will always be patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio indicates in which ratio Pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied by the value n , this is used with the value n * ( r / 4096 ) and then it will be re@@ directed . the value of 4096 is used , so that the Map @-@ file does not appear in the Map @-@ file ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ mas ) .
this setting is used because GM indicates that a keyboard player is to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some keyboards up to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some keyboards to find two sounds up to one octave higher . to get the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try out .
in order to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . you will find the settings below settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . if you have changed an instrument , if you have changed an instrument , the button does not illumin@@ ate more green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . the view of the menu settings below the dot @-@ channel view : settings
the temp@@ o @-@ LCD displays the speed which is played with a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find such a song may be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the temp@@ o , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
an MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus it can lead the same MIDI file to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways .
well , I can ni@@ directional , &amp; k@@ mid ; however , a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . in addition to a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have the control over everything .
this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from cold ; &apos; s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually .
understood , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add into &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; activate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to activate the collection of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can set the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the reproduction . to restore the default temp@@ o you can click on the LCD double .
I have a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this mode , I have to play a kar@@ aoke file ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , merely go into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to change the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file , without order to add to a collection , turn the setup Automatic adding to the collection , and the new file will be added to temporary collection added of files
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. not only want to play the first file . so , set the setting automatic add to collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then do you ent@@ ail to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards ! all many thanks ! if I listen to this songs or the postcard , animated me , continues to program &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

the window window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed if information is restored .
it is possible to pick up the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the thum@@ b playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups in order to add an extra hier@@ arch@@ est@@ u@@ fe . if you copied an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category . and playback begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and thum@@ b playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML files . of course , the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps can also be changed , but also by application itself . simply select the XML content of this divider only .
after changing XML files , you must select from the menu on the same with playlist , or select any other category .
all changes are lost if the processing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML Configuration files .
the animation on the starting and end can be disabled by the edit of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .

since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video , it should also work ( probably this sort of playback of video devices under Linux can also work on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux has to be functional for the X server , therefore it must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

Lat@@ ex ; : a professional copy application . under Unix style systems probably will likely be tra@@ ded on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; respectively , and tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; c@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the c@@ ile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; &amp; Linux ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals will be taken into account . if the support is required for this project or its documentation , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; website .
any questions or when compilation of &amp; c@@ ile ; on or are extensions , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; c@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ surroundings . &amp; c@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; offers the opportunity to complete , comp@@ iling , editing and error messages inside the source text as well as conversion and reference tools needed for this . conclu@@ ding , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to discover the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; c@@ ile ; can be found there directly with reading the chapter by &amp; Kate .

here &apos;s only a good quality review to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to get &amp; lat@@ ex ; please feel good B@@ Ã ¼ cher , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
same as other recording languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties like paper format , side number@@ ing and text box will begin with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } .
the quick entry @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a n@@ Ã ¼ r feature for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( menu ) offers some of the options for the creation of the document . it can also be performed some of the document related settings .
documentation categories : this is the type of the document that is used : articles ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ er@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or Custom .
encoding : hereby the character encoding of the system is used . modern systems will increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . at best , UTF @-@ 8x should be used as standard ( used for correct processing and lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
the list contains the most used additional pack@@ ets for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for the integration , they can only be balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , vol . ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the creation of German texts .
new users can &apos;t worry about it . it is just a short description of functions and more detailed information on this section .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , att@@ itudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . if you do not have any mathematical environment ( example ) : if you do not have any mathematical environment . however , it is still noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will be able to deliver you by the high@@ lighting time and guaranteed .
using automatic adjustment of environments , for input of a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the added line to close the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document in the following items ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ set element ) :
when view the document in the structural view , the single elements can be changed by a mouse click on the relevant image .
when creating your own &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; rendered un@@ locked file ) &#93; created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewing the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of format@@ ted document and also other information as the font size and also other information as the font size of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and print out DVI ; files for various systems and systems .
when using R@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ying search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor can be clicked on an element in the DVI @-@ file . once upon a section at &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code is clicked on the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewing angle .
Master @-@ document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a Master document , work is simplified with other in@@ bound .@@ tex files . during use of a project a project project can be set to project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if no error in the source code ) .
file recovery : in this mode the DVI @-@ file will be able to be able . guaranteed , and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction .
in consideration of the processing tool bar the three large boxes should follow all . the selection fields were developed for rapid integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The prescribed &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division :
the selection box for further information is available for products such as keywords , joints , notes , or references . the options are available :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection of over a selection box ) .
when using quote is indicated a selection list with literary entries . the author has good experiences with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the name has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; c@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ . it is used for defin@@ ing the text box for the main text , which can be set up by notes and notes . it will be the following documents available :
when the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two selection of options available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend of the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground on with the hand .
the brackets according to the command \ \ Organic class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size that will not be fixed at the beginning , this may also be done in the text .
once the above source code was entered , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of the menu , building or button@@ holes .
the source code must be stored before the compilation . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
check the compilation of the document should be searched for lack of errors . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
a environment ( English ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Universal environment } , \ \ \ and \ \ end { Universal environment ) will be able to provide a copy of correspondence in the surrounding area .
the changes are reserved only within the environment ( of \ \ Beg@@ in { Field } to \ \ end { Universal } ) . there is no labelling ( number ) for the exploitation within a environment .
there are many options to extend the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease printing , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either by the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { em@@ ph } : this command is for short @-@ intensive , until he is closed as long as long as he is closed with \ \ by { em@@ ph } or another environment . a single word can be explained in a set with \ \ em@@ ph { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex source file , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile , follows now .
once in the assistant was entered a bit of text , some adjustments for better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . for example , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive printing and a po@@ em to application to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed by Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E , you can return to the Editor &apos;s internal viewer . at an external viewer , the window must be closed .
as soon as the DVI ; file created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file will be converted . simply test and fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English . D e V ice I ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are printed like the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document using a file printing ( in the viewer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar ex@@ h@@ ort the conversion of the DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code can be created , the conversion into some other formats can start using the buttons in the tool bar .
the preliminary search ex@@ h@@ ort the direct jump from the editor to the same position within the DVI @-@ file .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; video files . only modern can be set up in settings ... tools and construction .
in order to search for the preliminary search , the mouse has to be positioned in one line of the source file and close up on prec@@ urs@@ or . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; viewing takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; available in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; available in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor ( Settings ... Editor )
if using quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; slide viewer is not possible to specify an error . it should be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the protocol file is simplified using the error source in the source code . the protocol file will always be used between the errors . in order to view the faul@@ ty line , the log file has to be clicked on the error in the log regulation , navig@@ ating to the incorrect line .
once upon the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the selected template for the document . the pre @-@ set properties are :
when selecting le@@ eres document , a document can be either written from the ground or to the assistant to create a new document . more information on this document are contained in the section .
half @-@ level users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates play@@ lists in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , it must be created either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file extension or a new file can be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template to create an existing document and choose from file template .
when creating a new document from a template by file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing code ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... settings General .
when creating the own template it is necessary to know what character strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this character string will be replaced by the input in the documentary class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and that associated entry into the editor . once the document was created , the following steps were completed :
when creating a new document , the template can then be balanced instead of the standard .
a template can be created from all &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for an internet connection and the steps below .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers of reading and high@@ ness of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly in the menu .
to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and his responsibilities , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; c@@ ile ; sing there directly with reading the chapter by &amp; Kate .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed by the La@@ Te@@ X Reference for almost all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click on the tr@@ l @-@ button to extend the &amp; tex ; the word that this way when clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ certified ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when using the text with the right lin@@ ker mouse button , the balanced text will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with twi@@ sted switch@@ box , some parts of the source file in the Edit@@ or@@ window will be balanced .
&amp; c@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the different types of source texts and these problems . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can have a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . this trampoline stamp is lifted up , so that they will automatically eng@@ age in the first input of a character .
the work is probably one of the main asp@@ ir@@ ation when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although outstanding features have been added to &amp; lat@@ ex ; especially important functions for the writing of an &amp; lat@@ ex ; specific commands for their selection . among the works are included , the following commands are included in the text selection :
a complete he@@ el ( group of lines written on both sides have a blank line ) . this extended meaning does not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only clari@@ fies thing in &amp; c@@ ile ; it is therefore that the par@@ lor are separated by two empty lines .
do the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also a extended meaning as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a rich star ( \ \ ) and an attractive star ( * ) at the end .
to download a part of a part of the document can be easily accessible and by pressing the button . &amp; Kate ; offers the key@@ word C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . you can remove the following commands to download the text of the text :
remov@@ es a complete sub@@ section . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; c@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit information he@@ el .
it has been clari@@ fied that environments can play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; c@@ ile ; for further orders under Be@@ work environment for an ideal work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the surrounding area .
with this command , at the end of current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surroundings .
if the cur@@ sor is found before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } the end of the area will be spra@@ yed ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
during the input of many magni@@ fied environment commands , this command can be lost quickly . this command slept the most recently closed environment , so that the swal@@ low environment structure will not be moved .
&amp; c@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . under Be@@ work Te@@ X group are a few important orders that are out of working environments .
with this command , at the beginning of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the se@@ clu@@ ded cl@@ amps .
with this command , at the end of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the flo@@ wering cl@@ amps .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group convers@@ ations ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
during the input of many w@@ asted groups of par@@ enth@@ es@@ es , this command can be lost quickly . this command slept the most recently restored group , so that the swal@@ lowed structure of &amp; tex ; groups cannot be moved .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy offices are used as G@@ Ã ¤ n@@ se@@ an . for the purpose of purpose , the sign &quot; is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two easy beg@@ ging will be used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close the beg@@ inner signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automated insertion of the double input characters can be set up under settings ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be switched off .
there are also other specific settings ( e.g. , or French ) and thus German or French offices are also used . there are also many other languages available .
in the drums of Shift ; input of Shift ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , if the current position is within a lists but at the same time the command \ \ item is one .
we slept &amp; k@@ ile within a tables of tables ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line breaks .
even better - &amp; c@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ set pre@@ fabri@@ cated &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to support them . you can set up La@@ Te@@ X ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users m@@ apped the columns in tables and environments . &amp; k@@ ile ; tries to encourage you . if this tab@@ ulator is not found in line . even though this tab@@ ulator is not the da@@ em@@ ulation ; some intermediate space for the columns of the current tab@@ s are added .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code , it has been installed in &amp; c@@ ile ; to have special orders ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are installed . all these modes are available for automatic adjustment of different types of adjustment to be setup ...
at the beginning of a new environment by the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surroundings } it will automatically add the command \ \ by { surroundings } following an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ button , the last letter of the input will be removed and you can see the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , there will be easily accessed by selecting a command . alternatively , there is a simple jump to these positions by using Be@@ ads Drive brand brand brand and then the parameters will be found .
under the settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; default settings can be made to these lists . it may be different to install several w@@ ont lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ Ã ¼ cher of general language used .
the command mode is to be entered into a few letters of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the complete mode will have a large list of environment . on the other hand , the environments are often used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the digest@@ ion of the environments is to be entered .
when calling the full @-@ in mode , the command can be automatically folded , the command is automatically m@@ illed and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . after that , the environment may continue to sim@@ pl@@ ying the easiest way and can be terminated by pressing the input .
after that is fully completed , the area will automatically be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a lists of environment , even a first \ \ item order will be inserted .
under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; default settings may be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of adjustment mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; c@@ ile ; under@@ lined custom lists of retri@@ eval boxes which are immediately replaced by l@@ ame boxes . the lists is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in example the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the code L is entered and the word is fully re@@ directed by the Men@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste mode , the letter L will be replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large lock@@ ers are not helpful . however , many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter are written in a document more than once . thus offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the land@@ fill for all already written w@@ et@@ ter .
this mode can be set up in settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ tical Settings ... can be determined here too . here , the sw@@ elling value for displaying results can be specified .
the fully automatic files can be installed in sub @-@ folders ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / / / mode / / hand@@ ful home folder . mode is available for ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ dictionary ) or tex .
the dialog for Graphics is designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphic formats , sections should be considered .
PS @-@ files are not as well known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . will be converted the pages with some &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to view the result of work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menu creation , creation and create .
for comp@@ iling of the source text for viewing , such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 3 by pressing Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and can be viewed by pressing Alt ; 5 the PS file is considered .
when using the command , quick construction is usually called a viewer after compilation . should no embedded viewer is used , every time a new window will be found .
a new project will be asked about the new project .... Hier@@ at will be asked for the following information about the project :
when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ames , the relative path must be given from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the control of EC@@ MAS@@ TER -@@ Ko@@ de . scripts can be managed in the vertical l@@ ush .
the API scripts are still not developed and can be seen in other versions of &amp; c@@ ile ; still living in other versions .
the first must be said that the extension environment of scripts in &amp; c@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded through a variety of different packages . offers a lot of different help to under@@ pass the user .
&amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as live ; are supplied with many documents . it includes documentation for the included pack@@ ets and an additional &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is not only one of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is a fully automatic instructions for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; but it is ideal for searching for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . as it is a very large file , it is divided into &amp; c@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; it is not always simple . as a great help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database of all to &amp; k@@ ile ; provided documents and here for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the most important advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or drums . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the bedding of the Le@@ ert@@ aste to the viewer for the document .
&amp; c@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source file extension available on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; can also be used for different archit@@ ec@@ tures . &amp; k@@ ile ; is also a part of the Fink project , allowing &amp; c@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X installed .
many thanks to those who offer to the continu@@ ance of the &amp; c@@ ile ; -@@ project stri@@ ving and d@@ af@@ e for many hours for the development of tools we can use all of the evaluation of the &amp; GNU ; license . current information on the privileg@@ es are available in the menu item &amp; k@@ ile ;

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative , have a little bit too . thus , the plug@@ in system is very powerful . you can now benefit from the additional functionality and do not need to wait until som@@ eb@@ ody can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more about it below .
to install a plug@@ in or part , we start plug@@ ging plug@@ ins with the menu plug@@ ins . the following dialog is opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the plug@@ ins and add any new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search ad . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative , this path leads to the plug @-@ ins .
often working on a project several persons in a sort of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quantitative data ; supports the indication of Team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Project Properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the top name of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team manager and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who is it . this happens when he is looking for the team member from the list and ex@@ presses the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( its identification ) will be f@@ ett after you are : text .
top names and attitude of their own identity are important for messages and notes . see for more information on notes .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the capture of members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader when something specific . see in further information .
event promotions are actions which will be executed if something specific could be done in the project . one example would be viewed later , or the sending of a message if a file is secured , or a script that will play a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
at the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can create events , edited and deleted .
an E@@ Mail is sent to the address data of the selected address data . the address at the address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such ladder are set .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note : it is easy to enter . it can be selected either of the editor menu entry menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary range followed by announ@@ cing text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax of the team member states or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby the top name of the team leader sub@@ project leader Sub@@ project leader Sub@@ project manager should be given the appropriate range or sub@@ project leaders , as in the examples below .
top names and roles names are independent of large or small scra@@ p , but spaces for the brackets and the note : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; quantitative information ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing , D@@ TD ag@@ nost@@ ic and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages supported .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . only about &amp; quantitative settings ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be addressed by the Quant@@ a Settings ... to be called . this dialog extends over a few pages that will be treated to each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative ; regarding tags including car vision can thus be changed . the entries are :
large / Klein@@ sch@@ ow of Tags : large / Klein@@ sch@@ ow of Tags : large / Klein@@ sch@@ ow means , the tags will be inserted so as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / Klein@@ sch@@ ow of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / Klein@@ sch@@ ow from automatic attri@@ bute . normal Great / Klein@@ sch@@ ow means , the attributes can be inserted so as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if cancelled , it is optional for tags that is optional for the exclusive day , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and end @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the appropriate day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic detection of Ak@@ zent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the corresponding encoding during the time .
M@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect various types of files . using button standard , the default pre@@ set can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or can be opened in other ways than with file open files ( where coding the file can be addressed ) , but this setting will be as@@ certain@@ ed by the same in the project features , if a project is charged .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . but this setting is out of the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative copy , created regularly , so at a power cut or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as the saving of the file . even if not stored documents , a backup will be created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial field or an own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ il@@ it@@ re ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and sources at the same time .
set the window settings back to the next start , if the user interface has come through change of the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views of each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
warning messages is used as a result of the possibility to in@@ quire the indication of warning through an@@ ic hooks of no more .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can also change symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ izing behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source content in shared mode . regarding the different modes see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the click of mouse click on the structural tree , it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural design with the mouse button .
in the range of structural tree settings , the no@@ bility of no@@ de in tree , which shall be opened automatically when updating the structure tree , will be discontinued . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found , where there are no element in the current document .
the area for determination of ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that will be un@@ folded for extensive text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s valid , each means there can be a valid group of PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation something else means as in a group is valid for Javascript .
here the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part of the third side , which can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the best known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following must be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in , if it is not on a standard place as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is delivered to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using . only l@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to load the load if this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : is this enabled , then test &amp; quantitative information ; if the distribution of the value is properly then , if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
as of version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting has been completely redesigned . di@@ e@@ Support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was discontinued , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of which a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which enables various implem@@ entations to plug @-@ plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ; in@@ quantitative .
using the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project with the selection of a matching debut plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
when a deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative interface ; user interface :
a view , in which the contents of super@@ vised variables is displayed . normally , in the left dock .
a view , where all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed below . normally , in the lower dock .
a view , where the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the Deb@@ ug@@ gers will usually appear in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to de@@ bug , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in with , on deb@@ ug@@ ging requirements . this promotion will be open by default , that a deb@@ ug@@ ger will not be counted on this promotion .

this chapter describes how you can custom@@ ize &amp; quantitative . to custom@@ ize your needs , and how you can use &amp; quantitative ; help to get better .
documentation typ editing packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative issues ; to give support for marketing and scripts . your simplicity and flexibility makes out of &amp; quantitative data ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and &amp; CSS . day folders contain two file types , the tag folders and the tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic @-@ oriented lending of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , text and instructions faster into a document as a user may vary .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be en@@ vious ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see details for the conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . shortly , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; quantitative data ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; self . tool@@ bars provide fast insert of tags in a document without risk of writing .
tag files are nothing as a folder . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the writ@@ able language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and clari@@ fied whether they are necessary , or not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information on the work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits are explained in a sim@@ pler way .
that is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but also contains no one element type over themselves else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for daily class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class where this method is . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has an common attri@@ bute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is an only element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this item can only be found once for each attri@@ bute . additionally , it sets the name and type of attri@@ bute . in addition , it contains further tags that will describe , as this attri@@ bute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type element .
returns the sources used for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attri@@ bute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative interface is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name is within &amp; quantitative . is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface name and a method@@ ology name . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . can be empty or % daily name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that is group@@ ed together with the elements of a list . it can only occur at once . it is an only element type element .
specify the position of a tags within a dialog . this day can only occur in a dialog for every attri@@ bute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ itive tags . this item is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that a day finish . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog is above &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , verification only occurs during charging the tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be recorded .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file will be described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ Day .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; Sunday &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just quite simple and there is a editor that can be edited via D@@ TD edit D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ et@@ r@@ c ; for one of a list selectable &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; it should be created with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
a action can be set with settings ... click on New action to the same dialogue :
that this promotion is allocated to the key@@ word . with clicking on the user , a button closure can be assigned ; with K@@ one is the current key@@ chains .
the sim@@ p@@ est promotions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and inserted in the document of the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications can be started ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or modify ( or parts of the document ) , but are the quick start @-@ start dialog or the various See in ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
the first must be the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are permitted , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ ly variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / apps in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document names .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; process . if by &amp; quantitative , only one instance is running , the text is used to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quantitative ; from the external script .
the parameter for this event , normally the file name of the document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods you can accept a script from &amp; quantitative ; on the default input . in the selection box may be determined , what to send to the default entry . options are :
the selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally meaning@@ ful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the introduced application can also be guided . there are two types of output : normal issue , on the default output issue ; error messages can be noted , which shall be specified to the default output written by the value the selection box output is set :
if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in the case there are not too many , so it can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure actions . choose Settings promotions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the lower end of the window will start working mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar .
complete all and if the day attributes has and you are planning to edit the dialog &quot; Day &quot; when available , allowing an input when use the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will be &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; use the &amp; k@@ box ; graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used as standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose size others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually used as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to be sign@@ alized ; starting this item is a &amp; lt ; starting ; -@@ day in current document is inserted .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens about the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quantitative ; ) and selection of the desired action . besides the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so there &apos;s still what is or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quantitative ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups . open the tool@@ bars dialog for selecting the tool@@ bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the Tren@@ ner ( very left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
I want to preview for example a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note that the separ@@ ators support the group . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by trial of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after re @-@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your tool bar ( n ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the elect enlargement of &amp; quantitative enhancement ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like to love . this chapter describes how I use a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check out in &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to search a existing documentation for the form@@ ation@@ - / script / etc ; language . then you will have to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will then cover the second part we will handle the second .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c &#93; = path , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for this docum@@ entations e.g. &amp; PHP ; section 2 , tag@@ 1 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ n@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c tell you = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 for scanning , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = introduction , ... Contin@@ u@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic Reference = Con@@ age@@ .@@ basic syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is a sub@@ folder in tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess p@@ ash ( except in Re@@ ason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the contents can be refer@@ enced directly onto a file ( and consequ@@ ent@@ ly at the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; res@@ sources can be replaced .
the syn@@ th section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is intended to be displayed on the design of the con@@ ve@@ x _ Fet@@ ch _ array function . by marking the function called and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file connections .
a simple list of simple context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ r@@ c / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / pers@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / directory / apps for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you stated that in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation here .
if you are certain that these well and it is worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the use of the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ community . they will not be rich but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative data ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the ver@@ t resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else . at different places , there is an email address , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ ing tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive from where all other &amp; quantitative data ; -@@ users can be reviewed and only made available if our team uses them as a correct and useful for the publication , to what it guarantees a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this means that the source of resources is ensured , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several key , you can get a look . in the dialog box the input fields must be filled empty ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the upload process .
the up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , tool bar tool bar , and in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , before installing &amp; quantitative , the integrity of the resource has been war@@ ned by the integrity and the Sig@@ ni@@ fication . if the integrity has been given , and it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity and the resource comes with signature , a message appears with the speci@@ fying the owner of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quantitative software , but it can be time to work , because hundreds of day files might be necessary in the tag@@ XML format , there is easier way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the Menu D@@ TD Download and converting your D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that will be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory : newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; will be written by this name to the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defin@@ itive line : the character string that appear in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / App@@ m@@ l@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , scores &amp; quantitative ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quantitative information ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and full use of &amp; quantitative ; they must first be able to deliver this fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative ; little benefit .
in &amp; quantitative , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ections . this differentiation affects a number of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are used for each , the &amp; quantitative control ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars over actions , everything is marked globally , in common file structure of &amp; quantitative . this allows the group of administ@@ rators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which at each time is available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development devices for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
proj@@ ections are available only within a specific project . this can be all supported by &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool bar with special actions especially designed for the files of a specific project . all elements are stored in the folder Tree of the project , which are the common use of special tools and designs of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editors , the building setting , the boxes with in@@ fos and the tool@@ bars . please add in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document matching entries , like close the current , other or all boxes , re@@ charge , er@@ ase or upload the document , jump to an exp@@ editions or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
legal click on the editorial department lead to another context menu related to the revised documentation , such as fundamental processing steps ( cut / copy / added ) , editing the mouse under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , if the string bet under the mouse poin@@ ter a file .
at the top end of the editors there are the tools of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; quantitative ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional as default , for which a set of tool bar will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quantitative ; the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if they want to insert it , then click the icon that the day represents , then you can enter the data for this just entered day . if you want to insert the data for this just ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog for different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to the information about &amp; quantitative ; to navigate them and to pass through . in the presentation with cart@@ ei@@ re@@ it@@ ers are available for files , project , sample templates , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation buildings .
project management is a powerful tool that allows you to manage all files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , upload or del@@ etion of files from storage media can be performed using the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; quantitative ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; quantitative . global templates are always available , local templates for the corresponding user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates can be found in .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of the integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information on a script . via the right mouse button there are further functions available , such as the script will be able to edit or send an email .
with this view it shows the internal structure of the active document . by Left @-@ Click an element , the cur@@ sor is set on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and review of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it can change many attributes and name rooms , which enables the change of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download and edit your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quantitative owns ; two boxes of boxes at the lower end of the window that can be reached via the usable information : the message window and the problem window .
this cartridge shows information about each in Quant@@ a running script . for example , the document used D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this Cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter shows all the bug in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quantitative data ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative and tool@@ bars ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the option of the tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative .
a further function of &amp; quantitative . is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email . &amp; quantitative call , sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an email , you can get them in &amp; quantitative ; like any other secure and charge !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quantitative ; -@@ files on your system . it has to be handed over a number of options to be handed over to the Script script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems at the start of &amp; quantitative ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before her bin folders . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative web development is optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a wide variety of powerful features .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; developer , the developer of &amp; quantitative , began to deal with a close idea : what would be when &amp; quantitative market editor would have ? well , this would be the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done so .
no longer on clean &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now it &apos;s far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . now it is possible to define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quantitative ; it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; quantitative research ; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; report is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ ours is not only it all possible , but allows users and developers to expand , as it need for their need .
&amp; quantitative interface ; allows you to improve the use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( on MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity with intuitive actions , scripts and tool@@ bars . thanks to the programme , you can also find &amp; quantitative tax . ( more then you will find them in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is connected in no way with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more into the details about the detailed documentation is with help : / Quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or save the help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; is currently developing and super@@ vised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a quick access list of files which you have opened . this list changed every time if you open a file , which is not located on the oldest entry .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later usage . check in the section above templates . should they try to save the selected file / Text out of the local / project template folder , only an error is reported .
converted to insert from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; note that it can be detected correctly and not understood from browser as a form@@ att@@ ing order .
converted the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; note that the correct way to insertion of special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor @-@ day .
switches the block selection to resp . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the Shift . button .
goes directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
for a character string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
shows the message window at or not . that &apos;s the window where you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
expansion and Swit@@ ching of the problem repor@@ ters at the lower edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main actors . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as to the structural tree changes .
shows the symbols of the main window on the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will be appearing in the menu together with the entries , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the file names of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quantitative data ; projects are stored by File Extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables , for example graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and add to the project .
download the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have additional inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
att@@ itudes , such as &amp; quantitative ; the project manages the project . chapter &amp; quantitative issues ; projects are explained details .
invites a project tool bar . these are kept in project position / tool@@ bars and are only assigned in this menu if you have assigned them this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that creates only the name . actions must be stored by settings ... are added to the tool bar or you will be asked if you want to store the machine tools .
remov@@ es a tool bar from the viewing range . if you are not saved from the hard disk . if you don &apos;t have any tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
so you can send your own tool bar at someone ( maybe at the &amp; quantitative call ; team , so the tool bar will be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as app@@ endix .
enables up@@ loading of tool bar to the main server , where each other can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or any one has made and convert into the &amp; quantitative format ; own label @-@ format .
download / ref@@ res@@ h to re@@ alities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; to renew itself , without the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; to renew this globally , and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , f@@ ails the load .
this menu contains a list of tags that is loaded into the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool@@ bar .
allows you to access the current day setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ tak@@ ings .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the intelligent insert of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . smart insert means that &amp; quantitative means that inser@@ ting tool bar does not work on this place the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins listed below are listed below . click on . click on a activated plug @-@ plug@@ ins .
elec@@ ts the syn@@ taxes set @-@ up mode for the current file . the list of available dimensions schem@@ es depends on der@@ ate ; version .
select the type of line @-@ up @-@ identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to create developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
exam@@ ines the syntax of the current document based on selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of external use T@@ id@@ y .
Instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over time may need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the cartridge mode , which is also the default setting mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quantitative ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu for each open window will have a entry . with selection of a contract , the corresponding window will be activated .
turns the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main chamber on or off .
the changes in this dialog does not influence any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; web browsers .
the behavior of the editors is one . in the documentation of &amp; Kate . finds details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the mouse button , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative software ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but like with each open source project , developers can always use help . if they want the &amp; quantitative form , you will find here the way .
the fields are self explan@@ atory and should be completed by the top of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project , and all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative file ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without space with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine that you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ f. .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you use this field empty , default settings of the selected protocol is used . depending on the remote controller , a adaptation might be necessary .
that is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be discontinued instead of the standards .
this is the folder where the tool bar will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standards .
this allows to insert files from local file system into the project . several files or whole file can be selected .
this setting is great when you have static web content you can download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) , you must go different .
p@@ act if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be mounted . if a project is based on new , not an@@ aken .
with this option all files and folders can be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to expertise .
this shows a list of files in main folders . you can select the desired files through an@@ hooks , or remove the check@@ box out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded into the menu with Project Properties in the menu mode or using the Shift Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some att@@ itudes correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described below . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) which can be re @-@ read in proj@@ ections such as project folders .
complem@@ entary option to top , also listed files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signal are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded at the opening of the project , can be read more about project views .
this means that your deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently , G@@ ub@@ ed will be supported . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set with the options . in this mode the error is described .
in the bottom window profiles can be up@@ loaded ( see in ) as well as the display of a building view for the contents of the server for each profile by clicking an own building view for every profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can change event promotions , change or delete these promotions , change or delete . event actions are executed if a previously certain event enters , such as the f@@ uses of a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; quantitative opens ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior is not possible to influence this behaviour .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quantitative data is closed , the project file will be automatically stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative files . same happens if you want a new project .
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
file behavior likewise , but missing the items open and open with ... in the right mouse button of the open context menu :
here you can choose different profiles . profile contains information about the place of high @-@ read files . see .
allows removing of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will end to prevent removing the removal .
the password will be kept in the nuclear storage and forget it . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the plate does not enter the option .
this will stop transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before loading .
in &amp; quantitative interface ; many high load profiles can be created and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to various servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server that should be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for the transfer . normally , this must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service to the usual port .
depending on your attack@@ ing hole , this is either a tim@@ es@@ aving function or a danger . use it to your discre@@ tion . the password will be stored on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but each with programming languages can easily see in the text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , you can replace various files and tool@@ bars and replace the current files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , can be stored or deleted via Settings tool bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative ; in which one has most to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantitative .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quantitative ; the best of the menu tool bar can be stack@@ ed . using and adding tool bar will be treated below in the section adding machine tools .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set on the tool@@ bar menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new tool@@ bar can be set , there can be other actions like tool@@ bar , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool bar can be executed in the dialog where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool bar .
by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries are removed and action worked , the self @-@ explan@@ atory are explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions can be set in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and settings are set .
templates are in essential document badge , code @-@ Schnitz@@ el and files on lin@@ king . &amp; quantitative data . you can copy , move or any in the system existing directory into the template &apos;s template . templates have in &amp; quantitative ; in about the restrictions you need to set up for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative data ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of any template .
binary &apos;s all , which is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted in documents via short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template @-@ tree under global templates . further information about templates tree is available in .
documents can be created by any text file type . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficiently . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information about templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents . you can find all of a comment about a final volume up to a complete volume on JavaScript or Perl @-@ based . see in for more information about templates tree .
as the name says we serve these templates for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a file structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative .
design a document structure to expos@@ ures ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File as template as a local template to store ....
once that happened , note that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the area tree under project buildings .
in your document , select text in your document and click file as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and lay on the construction view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only used in a template folder . it can be used to use all file management functions such as pulling and retri@@ eval or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can choose from a file tree or in the project files Bau@@ man@@ view to a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , it is secured by default , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
project templates allow a very targeted pre @-@ oriented approach or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files , add files or merge with them . in addition , some things can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep @-@ green .
the structure structure in the sub@@ windows templates is based on the files generated in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / directories / Quant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / directories / Quant@@ a / templates / directories . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as shown above .
to set up the behaviour of a folder where you can select the mouse button with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu tab . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is b@@ lown down once el@@ ter@@ nal attributes can be inher@@ ited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template . if a regular folder would be set , unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a pedi@@ at@@ folder .
allows you by prior or shown text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot lines for all templates for a particular project and enables copying of ingredients in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot lines a whole presentation with matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , you have a command menu ( on request , right mouse button ) on a full command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
it offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which are accessible via the menu . the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : he invites you to edit a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch to the source code stored in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that includes &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . there is no plans to change this behaviour .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that simultaneously running the changes in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor are syn@@ ch@@ ron in the source code and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , the key pressure on the active cur@@ sor is activated from a window to the others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source text editor can be selected via settings of V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ ization according to one click or automatically . if the selection can be set automatically , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the titles of the website , so it is possible to select the processing of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . that &apos;s the reduction of the hanging body . this means that you can change the following :
met@@ a tags permit the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. punch words for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list allows the amendment to the in@@ hal@@ tes , e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word keywords .
CSS rules are the new way of shap@@ ing of pages in browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below list or delete . a change on the list is exactly as for the met@@ a elements . the work of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to mount an external CSS style connection by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of cur@@ s@@ cur@@ s@@ ors is as in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is st@@ alled . the marking works as usual . lyrics can be inserted by single tap and can be deleted by clicking on the button .
the insertion of tags will be made in the same way through the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it &apos;s to be aware that the insertion of tags will not be removed ( e.g. if an anchor @-@ day , sur@@ round with text , each other ambient temperature must be removed ) .
some tool bar like the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used in the tables or lists of tools .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analysis of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles the search for certain elements are possible and the design of styles can be pursued .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you have successfully compiled but you need lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

a small ret@@ aining point must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and Z@@ eil@@ en@@ code . this will automatically be re@@ examined during the loading of the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . immediately after the start of a return ticket will be checked again .

there are many graphic tools for the same . why thus &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the posts made many changes and at the same time the influence had corrected . another programm@@ ers had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts to conduct .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within this lines . and there was no information on the places where perhaps the influence had changed . this changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of more useful functions have been added .
if you want to compare fast text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the comparative window .
a function that made much work was the same and merge of folders . this function was related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ tested file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of co@@ operate and changes the original file ( the basis ) helps to process the dis@@ sol@@ ving result . this Editor allows you to edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three Qu@@ ell files during cl@@ oning :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also complete the same and merge file . this screen photograph shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when file merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and are based on the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you need to check these functions , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance in the column on the left side . ( no trouble more if J@@ one change the influence . )
when a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then the color indicates that file is different . red color indicates that both files are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ work easier by writing only the file names of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder , folder 2 folder 3 folder , folder 2 folder 3 folder .
the opening dialog allows manual setting of file names , the selection above the file format ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the list . you must not specify a third file ; if you let the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be carried out .
above the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge file is selected , if for A file is selected , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in both other folders .
if inter@@ locking is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file . you can also get this step later while saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you would not like to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active comparison window . compared to Open Dialog , you have to select no files , you can simply connect the dialog with the off button .
you can also use gyp@@ sum and drag : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and leave it over a comparative window .
what thought is behind ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similarly these features are , it would be just like to load and compare these relevant sections . now you can copy and compare these relevant sections , then compare and then compare it .
note : currently you can remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; remove only the rest of the text in a comparative window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ ts the pulling and retri@@ eve text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and insertion ) . in such cases your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optional . ) Any Info line has a different color . ( if the path comes to a file , leave the mouse over the line . then a small accessory window will display the full name . )
the three sources are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a color is blue , B , the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees the color , which file diff@@ ers . if both files are different , the default color is for red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is visible in the next section ( merge ) .
in addition to the text , the column is displayed . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . with some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful only to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in character strings and comments , for the processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line that separates the inter@@ dial column from the text , where the respective source file has no lines . if the line @-@ turn is activated , the line will be displayed on broken lines .
the results window ( under the comparative figures ) also has an information line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; encoder &#93; , if you have processed the result . normally it contains the automatic movement , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! till all conflicts have been dissolved , the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next most dissolved / ung@@ od@@ ly conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is to be solved in the same time a conflict of the manual .
by one click with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed , where the current group is not visible . ) This group is then highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left shows a black beam .
sometimes , through the automatic merge or manual loading , no further line remains in the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion , and perhaps again a different source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , still in a marking which you may copy and add differently .
the text &amp; lt ; interaction con@@ flu@@ ence ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources select the options to ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly to the image processing and mouse , but you can also use the arrow keys left , right , high , round , side down , side down , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w can also be used by other programs . the super@@ saf@@ est column next to the vertical picture strip can also be used by clicking on navigation .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with insertion button you can switch between feet and transfer mode . ( default is the entry @-@ in mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary @-@ columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as described in the section ) and the ed@@ itable output window was explained .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Fig . / Str@@ g @-@ Fig . ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Image Re@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ Image Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict continues to be considered a conflict . therefore , between dissolved and inv@@ alid conflicts must also be distinguished .
to copy the marking into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ g @-@ insert ) . if this option is activated , the option will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and automatically adjust manual copying . be careful with this option , because you might want to see the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ches are stored accordingly to the respective operating system . UNIX variants use a row @-@ line sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems using the line @-@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 maintains the line of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restored in the next start . ( menu setting ) &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog displays scriptures with variable width to choose , you should not use it . )
if you dis@@ able this option , the differences are displayed in short text . if the chosen scripture does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be represented . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically introduces an od@@ ast@@ ated color .
if this option is enabled , when pressing the tab key , the corresponding number is inserted . otherwise it is inserted a tab character .
if you press input or return , the setting of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , any selection will be copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copying into the cli@@ p@@ board then falls .
you can select which line @-@ type type you prefer to Save . the default value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system .
in the same files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines are to be igno@@ red . only during this first step , white characters are igno@@ red . the second step is not igno@@ red every line . in this step , white characters are not igno@@ red . too , white characters are not igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back mark &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other in turn , only one lap plate , but then they could only be handled with different sizes in the side @-@ side comparison , though they are different . if this option has to be activated , however , this option must be disabled . in default , this option has to be disabled . this option is de@@ activated .
in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are igno@@ red . however , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensi@@ vely , even smaller differences are looking for . this option is activated in default and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic check mode , this setting , how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next release is continuing .
automatically dis@@ solves the conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters occur in many files . if you don &apos;t need to use the functions of voters in numbers or comments , if the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in chapter for scanning of folders and trans@@ mitting a mer@@ ging . look for details on documentation to the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to finish and rest@@ art the current program . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is terminated globally through the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
about the selection fields for the encoding appears a short notice that is the local coding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a clean character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this does not affect how special characters is treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
if you want to process a file , you can define which coding are used to store .
if you define prec@@ epts , they could not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files may not be Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output of Vor@@ ver@@ processing .
dis@@ able this to supp@@ ress the read@@ ings of changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color@@ fully coded transformer column . but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal version with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
classified the comparison window next to each other or to each other . this can also be useful to ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files . here , if you are using only two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file names of the last source file as pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to start merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own label , e.g. for cutting un@@ distur@@ bing parts or to correct use .
when reading a file it is given first to this remote command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when using this command processor command . you can write your own label , which corresponds to your requirements . each input line needs to have a corresponding issue line .
the thought behind it is possible to enable the user more flexibility when creating the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program needs , and most users want to program it . the good news is , however , that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ent expression on any character string . the \ \ 1 in the replacement text does not refer to the found text in the first cl@@ ung . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word \ \ \ _ BAR _ copy \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with SE@@ D , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may use this regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the igno@@ red numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example for a further processing command for line ab@@ brevi@@ ation . SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; is a suitable matches , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , thus virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
instead of SE@@ D you can also use something different like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are needed for per@@ l some details . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs to be per@@ l only ( and ) without the &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data following the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merge . the other operations change only the data that the line output equal to Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
please note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ processor does not see the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful but how the text changes or differences are hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and do in the worst case important data .
often , programm@@ ers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders and merge .
... makes a suggest@@ ion for each object ; you can custom@@ ize the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate and show the simul@@ ated changes , without creating them ,
... exec@@ utes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) ,
this is very similar to the same and merge of individual files . you just need to file the file on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are summarized , folder 1 is used as a basis . if no target file has been given , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will not start automatically the merge . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow )
during the reading of the folder you will inform you a small message window over the current progress . if you start scanning the folders , only the files are listed , which have been compared until then .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folders that was found during the Scan can be found here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
file size is usually folded . you can select a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or select the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions and all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders or fold .
when you click on a double click , the file is started and it appears a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different from the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such cases the merge @-@ feet action can not be selected automatically . if the merge may be started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if its total content is identical . then , file the same color . with folders , the age is in@@ significant for his color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colors reflect the colours of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copy of A ( or if a does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such def@@ ective objects can exist , the merge cannot be launched .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such def@@ ective objects can exist , the merge cannot be launched .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicitly specified target file , then cho@@ oses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the required action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and the result in both folders . ( the user can see as visible file names for the output file just B ; directly after mer@@ ging and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders can be merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such bugs cannot be solved , the merge of the file can not be started .
during the merge , a file is done according to the other . you will show the status column if the merge has been successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected . if the mer@@ ging is complete , you should make a final review and see if the status is everywhere in order .
if set in a setup dialog for full analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these include the number of ung@@ ast@@ eries , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared to or merge . )
you can either merge either the selected entry ( file or od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the cl@@ ut@@ ations @-@ related actions ( also in all subjects ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have no target file , then in the three @-@ file merge mode C is used as the objective , where two @-@ file merge will lead B as a goal and to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as the target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries could be displayed in the folders , also in the file structure , there are some options due to the certain entries could be displayed . check these options for un@@ pleasant surprises :
to summar@@ ize all entries : select directory guide / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ chains ) . to run only the current entry : select promotion of the current element or press F6 .
if using contra@@ dic@@ tory file types still un@@ inv@@ alid merge promotions , a message appears that shows the incorrect elements . they can then choose a valid promotion .
if you carry out all entries , a dialog window appears with options , ejac@@ ul@@ ating and break .
dial Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then receive a complete list of all promotions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; runs certain actions with all entries . if a manual input is necessary ( merge of a single file ) , then a merge window will be open ( note the screen photo ) .
if you are ready to start with a file , choose a directory guide / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages which can help you to select the cause of the problem or to solve the problem to select or to solve the problem in any way before using the merge .
if there are some entries individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not lead them together with later . even if this merge has been carried out or not saved , these entries will be taken as done . only if you change the merge promotion , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory Con@@ duct with these options :
only files that fit onto the specified sample are displayed in the Elem@@ ental tree . do you separate the samples with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ one ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files which are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mat@@ ically created files are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( check out at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signal ) .
in some file systems files have a hiding -@@ attri@@ bute . in other file systems marks a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on .
with links to files : if the option is shut down , symbolic link is compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to show the links . this is de@@ activated in the default .
with links to folders : if the option is switched off , the links is switched on . if the option is enabled , the links are treated as normal folder and recur@@ sively searched it . ( note that if the option is turned on a link to itself , lead &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es off . ) This option is switched off in default .
a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number dissolved , un@@ questi@@ oned , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis , and considerably slower when it is applied to files that do no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare big folder on a slow network , it may be much faster , only the change date and the file size is to compare . this speed is required by default . please use this option for default .
similarly to the change date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical if it is equally large , if it is equal to copying the change date . please use this option for default .
activ@@ ating synchron@@ ize mode if two folders are compared and no target file specified . in this mode , the proposals will be identical to merge that both folders are identical . this option is switched off in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is no knowledge that the other file does not have changed . ) This option is shut down in the default .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by another file , the original version is renamed and ob@@ tains the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file with the .@@ original extension already exists , this is also possible without further backup . this option is enabled in the default setting . this option is switched on .
usually , the file merge updates are visible in the merge of single files ; you can switch the window divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want that , you can switch the window tool@@ bar into the window menu and switch between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file just using double click . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also use a single file , without first file merge . once you can save the result , the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged again when you start folder .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax for local files and folders . some things should be observed :
a path can be relatively und@@ oder . or .. that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty card &gt; % 20 , etc . ) , for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to process per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note that this option is only possible in local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently available as the differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts at first always the built @-@ in differences test . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch starts to restore the missing file .
in the c@@ quer@@ or , you can preview on a patch file and choose a patch menu click - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if not the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since generation of Patch @-@ file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot ) is already available . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 shows that it can perform as the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot when I saw in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers who have gone this way or want to go .
you don &apos;t have the program compiled from sources and it doesn &apos;t have the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines will be treated as the same ; if only one non @-@ white characters is treated differently , the line will not be treated as the same . if there is no other than the other , this box is co@@ dec . this box is guaranteed the case .
the editor will notice for each difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a file format which could store this information .
the effort to have so far too big . you can always recover a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit bigger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; published and the text does not delete . what does it mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors for lifting differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . use the other editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .

to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ You gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ certain , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no problems at comp@@ ile . should however , trouble occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ lists thereof .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or switch @-@ removing ) into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current mark .
only differences in : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder , therefore not in target folders .
( in the current program version you have to re @-@ read the folder with the function Update to these options . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are displayed . if the target folder cannot be copied to merge folders . if the target file does not contain these files , they are missing after the merger . ( the behavior is probably modified in a later program version . ) This option is displayed in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , if the lines are already present , they are immediately removed immediately .
in the default setting this option is disabled . differences in single signs ( e.g. &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; @-@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite practical to change their size to move them or move them or move them . this works both within a single Desktop as well as at several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work surfaces as well as those in running applications . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and the other .
with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends on it , where the right mouse button is cli@@ pped . if it was clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only be clicked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and end . these commands include the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only if it was clicked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if it was clicked on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows within the &amp; p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , will be displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work surfaces are displayed .
cross the field lets you cross the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working areas . is it together with name , the names are provided with ordained , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also appear as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; indicated . otherwise only the empty space surfaces are displayed in order to enable their selection .
here is the view of the program window selected . just shows simple rectangle with the propor@@ tions of program windows . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic can be known &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in some other window managers , like from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual working areas in a vertical row , which is very good for the display at the front of the desktop .
the &amp; @-@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can display windows as symbols or with their contents . it also runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; c@@ ager ; and followed by selecting the switch @-@ switch ... lets the dialog be released .
at the moment , this can not be changed in the dialog for Settings : but you can finish this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c using any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you have no write permission for the file , you must register to your system administrator . in this file you need to transfer the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and to this value . possible values are :

it is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ mag . you can read a magni@@ fying glass for the reading or the exact viewing of a photos . this documentation is an artist , web @-@ designer and people with a visual experience . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded by new features . it is optimized for use on performance computing .
when you play &amp; k@@ mag , a window as shown above . shows the extended range of screen . in the following , this window is named as magni@@ fying window .. The picture that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged range of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , it has increased &amp; k@@ mag . alternatively , you can see &amp; k@@ mag . alternatively a selected screen range in the magni@@ fication window ( select mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter on the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that it is not able to recognize the form of mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default file ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection mode you can custom@@ ize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse poin@@ ter into the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture the contents of the magni@@ fier and move it with the arrow keys .
if you add the &amp; Shift ; button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection point is fixed and just the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert into a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . the stop of the update causes that the needed CPU time is going to go to 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; used automatically your introduced short notice to store files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ aden ( with the button document again up@@ loading in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and Ver@@ tical &amp; etc ; .
k@@ ewise also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use a magni@@ fying glass to view the cl@@ oning in a newspaper or a photo . this application is intended for various people of benefits : from research or artist to Web@@ designer or acci@@ dental .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive mode in@@ mate syndrome ) and for which any mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same place . it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate the p@@ iti@@ ation of the p@@ iti@@ ation ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and that each mouse click pain . Moreover , it is also possible to em@@ ulate it with the mouse . this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which is created when using the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can listen to the blo@@ om because of your computer that use your computer , if this is not yet done .
in order to be able to clari@@ fy it even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the mouse due to the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all the ergonomic supplies shall apply : the result can fall for each different result .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and performs a mouse click , as soon as you break down the movement .
is the smart move activ@@ ates , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . move it up to the end of motion before leaving the mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little exercise , but you get rid of it quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement , after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool must have a mouse click .
if Intelli@@ gen is switched on , the turning radius ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the de@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will wait until you start the mouse button before it will release the mouse button if there is no evidence because of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now it is enabled by mouse button . if this function is enabled , a slow down to the right and back , followed by a break . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can easily reduce the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; available . this function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please check the respective documentation to figure out how you start a program automatically .
set all the settings on the values which were stopped when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the button , the settings are reset to the users after pressing the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the pres@@ ets . in particular , intelligent move , you should first be switched off . if you are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the automatic mouse , you can later remove the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect . clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in browser window that doesn &apos;t link to un@@ washed reactions . you can use the mouse to park such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is ruck@@ ing , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s normally quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse balls , but also the roles in contact with the mouse ball .
first , you need to remove the mouse balls . as it happens , from mouse to mouse differently , it should be quickly clear when you see the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the version of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when you just start a shi@@ fting process . if you &apos;re in this case the intelligent move , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean by leaving the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will be reset to the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can also work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to perform mouse click and sets the cur@@ sor to another passage .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of mind when you want to make it possible . however , you can use the mouse for mouse poin@@ ter . secure zones for mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey surfaces around the tool bar and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with an intelligent move , but I do not create it to edit the text .
intelligent move is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very probably possible to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or move it with pressed mouse button . however , there will probably be some problems once again . here are some advice about it :
just don &apos;t use the smart move , if you just start with &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; please note the text instead of a mouse click and hold the switch @-@ off key , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and enter the mouse button again .
using the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you can easily use the intelligent move without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this need some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; must be installed , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window , must be installed . this should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are decorated correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; check out the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter . this program was developed for people who suff@@ ers to the RS@@ I syndrome , and to whom the Con@@ firm dies p@@ ains p@@ ains .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time it is waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button will start . in this way , the pulling power can also be carried out using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows users to speak with the m@@ ute user to their computer .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can &apos;t let users speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk of propositions which will be spoken once again .
on the first side of the assistant ( left screen photo ) you will give the command a , which later is used for the voice edition of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup catalogue .
on the second side , select the standard text box book . from the appropriate password @-@ books you can choose to select text fitting , without any type . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right @-@ screen photo ) you define the dictionary for the worst language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ ell words are taken into the Wor@@ ter@@ hole .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is confident and includes essentially an input field for the scanning of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a delay of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; you can enter the phr@@ ases that you want to listen in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the circul@@ atory memory . you can select the propositions which will be spoken once again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cartridge cards , language output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ sen as well as the side K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the map copy , enter the command to the call of the speech . in the menu box , place the character encoding , with the text to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . select the check box when the text remains unchanged as default to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is transmitted as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the svn merge command depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples for you find in App@@ endix .
with as possible language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to share the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings will be igno@@ red on this page and the option is a standardis@@ ed interface for voice recognition and the option of this option is meaning@@ fully automatically , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ word or by selecting a text passage in the menu text pass@@ agen@@ book or in the brush for Text@@ pass@@ ag@@ les .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage will be spoken directly and inserted in addition to the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially be entered into the input field .
with the second selection field Cl@@ ose of the Edit menu for Text pass@@ agen@@ das you can define whether the password guide will be saved automatically when closing the processing power .
with the selection of text appropriate book , the book is stored . if you choose any changes , the password command is not stored . select on Save , is &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the password guide will be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ sen contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ ia . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list is more than a dictionary . with this selection box you can choose the currently used Dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ d .
with the buttons right on the side you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries or add them to a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation a . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by decl@@ aring the adv@@ ent . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , to insert just correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are summarized , and how these weights should be fulfilled .
with this option , place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered the dictionary automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary using your voc@@ abul@@ ary over time .
the main area of the window for the processing of text boxes is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the text box books are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you are selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key@@ word . if you have a text box book , you can only change its name .
actions like new passages or books add or select text packages and books , you can either choose from the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a foldable menu .
the sequence of text boxes or passages can be done by pulling with the mouse on the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the run storage can be selected .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the run storage can be selected .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text in the input field is used , this is used , otherwise the selected phr@@ ases of the los@@ ers will be used .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar with buttons used for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged by default directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow cr@@ ust is indicated in the lower part of the main road with Hin@@ ds on the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not crossed , this status bar will be cancelled .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ der for text pass@@ ag@@ ings with entries indicated . the bar is arranged by default directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have the command for the language output does not work properly or not complete . open settings k@@ mouth ; open ... , open the page general settings and enter the command for the language output to the card file . ( see Settings for voice syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
the festival is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently , English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ o are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without restrictions .
in order to indicate an example of the command line for setting the language output , it is assumed that the festival / usr / local / festival is installed . the command for voice recognition is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an English @-@ driven voice generator . currently , it supports only the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and further restrictions .
in order to indicate an example of the command line for the installation of language output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ er . the language output is then possible with one of the three command samples :
for the third example , the option has to be switched on as default . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ ic into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax loves the last character of the text , so that an additional characters must be changed . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command need to be written in a line . the option data as default set must be switched on .
the language output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further speech service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being used in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since setting the voice of the voice only occurs in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service which appears in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application to allow people who cannot speak text through the computer . there is a list already reviewed sets that can be re @-@ returned to the user again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the speech output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of modules existing service , which allows any application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a partial system in &amp; k@@ de ; for language output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer ready to provide with the applications with T@@ TS skills . users can also offer interesting options .
read texts ( or parts of them ) in the text editor &amp; Kate . , even when &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; cold ; -@@ applications is embedded .
the language output takes place via the program of your program , which has various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) on the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; assistance program .
Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( SM@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ markings @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language output service of &amp; k@@ de ; an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the text of a web page or parts of it .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read all or partially read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org / ) you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can also subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ n@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de.@@ org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you will need to install program on @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and properly set . see also
for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as yet no speaker is decorated , the map speaker is shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map card will be shown . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , so also various male or female , or such that distingu@@ ish themselves in noise or speed . you can also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should select at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; since the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is used otherwise the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printers for the same printer .
when you click on the speaker card speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map speaker is shown . this will also appear automatically when you start a ts@@ m@@ gr , and not have a speaker set .
all known speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the top speaker is used for speech output when an application is no spokes@@ person .
to select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the nar@@ rator from the list .
to select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
to select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list is also its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system to apply .
choose one tuning type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and maid service .
when you click here , the new speaker on the map speaker is available . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost use . go back to Kart@@ u@@ card General and check if you want to activate text ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to allow text to read and manage text . please click on the boxes to create and manage text applications . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language system of &amp; k@@ de ; start to open this card card . here you can set some general options here .
mark the check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this is the start successfully , and you can create text messages , and you can read text applications and proceed . see . remove the marking , will be K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when the ts@@ m@@ gr will end , run &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the field activ@@ ates the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears when automatically read in the system area of the control bar , dis@@ appears once the occurr@@ ence is finished .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders to break , hold and record again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the actual text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for one order .
click on users or OK , then all changed settings on all sides .
the card ticket orders will be displayed only if K@@ TT@@ SD was started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the card ticket General and cross the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web@@ page . check first if you should read , and select the text menu Tools . after a short time the language output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; advance lines and other invisible brands will also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the expanded text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs first , and select the text that will be read , and select in the main menu Tools text . then the language output should start .
this works even if &amp; Kate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can be notified by you at the specified events . you can read the text of this news even by &amp; kt@@ ts ;
in &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various kinds of messages . you can view &amp; conversation ; for example , you will be notified if you arrive at a I@@ RC channel , in which your nick@@ name is fore@@ seen . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program . the default settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on application .
filter for the drawing chain provide a good opportunity to correct ; wrong or incorrect , is a good example . it is a good example . it is a good example . they removed the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by the mail , and additionally the expression / local / In@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in fil@@ tering , text is processed before it is sent to the program of your program , to replace false words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a matching language and speaker , or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice synthesis and their voices .
to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program is working with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; different types of texts .
the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and will keep those orders . if the edition of the Screen Reader is read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that is used . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome the room . &amp; k@@ de ; al@@ erts are also news . read more .
the rest are simple text orders . KS@@ ay@@ it is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text applications . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have been used text@@ books . text agreements are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no particular pressure .
all four orders are processed in maintenance @-@ long , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application reads the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just a such pre@@ text , this issue will keep and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reag@@ ents . they will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text applications as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and enter it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . these parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expres@@ sions , which enable the creation of chat emotions such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; mail ; in a better common form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format in a different format . included in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaking filters you can send orders dependent on the text , or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , if you have posted a female voice , you can read the text by K@@ DE messages . you can read the text by K@@ DE messages .
each of these different filters are adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a language output . if the filter is fixed that his rules are not applicable , he will continue the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent , it will be processed by all activated filters , which are set down on the page below . the processing of filters will be displayed in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of designed standard filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be removed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filters , and it will be shown below the next setup dialog .
for the installation of character string filter you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as comparison chart . then the text is exchanged in text , then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text .
specify a name for your filter . if you select any name , it is necessary to distingu@@ ish it from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filters compare the text with the string chains in the column line and replaces it in accordance with the strings from the column . the list is executed in the shown order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular express from a file , stored the current list or delete . download a list of file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered , the filter is only applied when the speaker is only applied for the text order one of the here registered languages . you can also select several languages if you press the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key press .
if a value is registered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the user @-@ ID @-@ run programs will get you with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers must be we@@ aving . if an example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only use copy .
the character string filter is only applied to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words the character string filter uses regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ . the words must be limited to mark characters ( empty characters ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular expres@@ sions , you can call it in the di@@ alog@@ s &amp; edit ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in a different format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such trans@@ forms . however , the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
in case of speaking filters you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the board card speaker , or in a speaker with specific features . you can specify that texts by a female voice should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text to the filter is looking for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; send the properties of the speakers for speaker speaker . with the spokes@@ person filter you can write the selected speaker .
if the filter is used here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular expres@@ sions , you can call this with one click on the button to get help from input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to ro@@ ver the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired microphone conditions . if the text displayed the above mentioned filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements , click on the right to view the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or retri@@ eve your microphone settings or to delete all settings .
the office optional filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box will apply Ap@@ ply filter whenever you need to apply at least one condition .
the language output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmer to give its applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , added with the syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD which can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / releases bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .

any of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; conversion filter set up , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able work at all . you will also do if you have this voice not to read from web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and allows you to find the variable P@@ AT@@ H program .
certain character or interest characters seem to cause error while syn@@ thes@@ izers , so that all propositions are ski@@ pped or just Kau@@ der@@ wi@@ l . what can I do against it ?
initially , make sure that the option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be solved by a character string filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched at the command line in a &amp; console ; started .
the list of the above languages can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . go therefore the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages ; see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; s @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want &amp; kt@@ ops ; to use any other syn@@ thes@@ izers , continue with the development team in conjunction with the development team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML ; conversion filter is not necessarily required . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
in order to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; s @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts , from the source code for k@@ de@@ ur , or download any night currently created Tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first if you use a self @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher with your voice syn@@ thesizer . this allows you to use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; which is intended to be further developed by the program on the device of the device with a remote @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , and the SPD @-@ conf script will no longer be needed .
a long text is divided into individual phr@@ ases . the user can decrease or cancel or cancel the issue or cancel his release .
if an application text on &amp; kt@@ ops , you can request the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you choose a speaker , whose language is English and whose sex is female , this is used , otherwise it will be chosen by the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about it , see &amp; kt@@ ops ; you will see you in .
if you click on the box for a speaker , click here to add a speaker into the list or click Edit , the map speaker system will be displayed . as an example , the boxes of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details of the modules are available . details of the modules are available .
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path to Festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you will only need to enter festival .
choose the character encoding for text , which is handed over to the festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is generally regarded that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 will be used , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with this sli@@ der , you will feature volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you don &apos;t select a regulator , you cannot select this grey voice from you chosen voice .
several voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to be loaded several seconds due to their size several seconds . if you select this check box , these voices will already be charged at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first movement is faster than faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set a speaker ( or forgotten to click on the user ) . see .
if this check box is marked with the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window kt@@ ts@@ . otherwise it is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is read a text . thus , you have the opportunity to read or control elsewhere .
here are all orders in the maintenance long listed , along with the application that set the order , the current status of order , the number of propositions and the just processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can proceed to the order that is selected in the list below , or back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) and a ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . click on this icon to view the screen window .
if the sound system &apos;s sound system is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card Audio . see also .
there are only Text passages and manages issues of screen reag@@ ents , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; see in .
select the type of audio output . if a component is not selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module , cannot download the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module , select the PCM device here . see also
set the subscri@@ ber speed here . 50 n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % approximately the double normal microphone speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed SO@@ X .
click on User to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system to take over .
the list of the AL@@ SA devices are all PCM devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose standard .
on this card map you can set special actions which are always executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders :
the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has advanced the highest priority . it will be submitted to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the Screen readers will be read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the presentation of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just have a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless som@@ eb@@ ody welcome the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen @-@ reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the maintenance @-@ long one .
this audio file will always be interrupted when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound is active as well as introductory message , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message .
the settings on this card map are only valid for normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings and issues of screen reag@@ ents there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the map messages appears .
mark the check box to switch the read of &amp; k@@ de ; dis@@ rup@@ tions . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ erts .
if this setting is marked , al@@ erts , where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
using these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned in an I@@ RC message to your nick@@ name .
all events that are otherwise stated in the list are igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
use this selection box to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event meets . you have the following selection :
if you select the customized text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can choose here the characteristics of the desired microphone . standard cho@@ oses the speaker that is shown in the list on the map speaker for the top entry .
note that there is three levels for events . if the action is set for a specific application , this is executed . otherwise the action will run for any other events of certain application . the last possibility comes to carry out the action under standard ( all other events ) .
the event all al@@ erts for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the al@@ erts as follows :
use the button to store the settings for the al@@ erts in a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start reading the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries will be deleted out of all dis@@ rup@@ tions .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice recording . this standard contains stamps for controlling voices , voice of voice and pitch . furthermore , marks for the control of the pron@@ unci@@ ation . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only available in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( UK male ) because it is the default voice that the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or tape during the festival configuration dialog is not limited to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . this can start &amp; kt@@ ops ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also hold on the map of orders for a succ@@ essive or return , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is automatically set up a set of sat@@ ile filters . you can change its settings , or further pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter , but is not recommended .
on the sim@@ pl@@ est , you can choose to set up the device selection by selecting . switch on the card selection and enter text . go on the card selection again , change some features and check out how the selection of the spokes@@ man has changed , otherwise , you need more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then the first movement can start , since only the first movement has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can get text orders on the card map or cancel your function , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal Sat@@ is@@ ance filter is automatically set up when you start the ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot change , only removed . change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do .
pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a table character ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) , before fil@@ tering ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) , before the fil@@ tering is automatically removed from the text . note that the standard sat@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter keeps the character control .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( cold ) , war@@ nings , messages or the edition of screen reag@@ ents .
if you have removed from the normal Sat@@ is@@ bound@@ ary filter , you can add this again by downloading the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the card interface selected , you can write the subscri@@ bers for the application . the card card will be displayed if

I loaded an extra voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use them in Festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will not show this voice .
in the file , add $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ int / vo@@ i@@ v@@ ices . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card audio , there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be installed SO@@ X and via the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are igno@@ red when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; ( it is indicated that the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you have very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ ph file of the &amp; HTML ; and set up the microphone speed up .
I do not create that web pages are read with a female voice . I have a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta it seems to work the day S@@ able gender . so that festival does not produce an error , the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML into S@@ aber the gender tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a custom character set filter and now I can see in &amp; kt@@ ts ; not more sat@@ bil@@ ling or back . on the card re@@ covering orders will be displayed , the order consists of existing only from a set . what am I doing wrong ?

before you start &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally well , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops ; set .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are delivered with the festival . would you like to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of festival . the German voices will be subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice consists of 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage stage . un@@ pack the software at festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian votes , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; -@@ distri@@ butions . find festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit K@@ yr@@ illi@@ c an example for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ic@@ ism analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables the management of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings on a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; c@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t install . physical equipment and its drivers have already been fully operational and configured to configure &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all times and setting the network properties .
in most cases drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . network appliances will be added later , the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version , to be loaded :
the module network settings will be charged if the network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . during the start of the module network settings , this system automatically tries to detect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the hands of the list is offered . it is the platform from the list , which the distribution and release of the release is best . through mark@@ ting of the setting , it can be taken permanently . at the next start of network settings , this selection will automatically be pre@@ set automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in system administ@@ rati@@ onal mode . before , all options are displayed , what does the settings can be considered only , the change mode is not possible . in the system administ@@ rati@@ fication mode you can proceed by clicking the button placement mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
in the system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage the network appliances of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the displayed network interfaces can be addressed by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the interface ... in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Extended settings shows the dialogue with further possibilities .
in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings will be collected by using a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will control all the necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , therefore , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
the TCP / IP address can be made to the TCP / IP address without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address you need to set the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask is fixed .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alized the network interface during bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization doesn &apos;t wish , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the box box .
it should be ensured that the IP address will not be used in the network . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the desired address is already used in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off according to your requirements . insertion of a network configuration is done by selecting from the list and click of interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . switching on a activated network equipment will be dis@@ able by selecting the list and click interface .
the IP address of the host is fixed in the local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway is selected .
a machine with DNS support will be replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers requires only IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org means that this name dis@@ solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator to the name resolution part of the equ@@ ali@@ zer name resolution allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added , remov@@ es or amended .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a contract and up or down in the list with the buttons to be ordered separately .
Adding the button to add ... from the group computer to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog for the new name server .
first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group computer to the name resolution select one entry and then click on the button .... It will display the dialog box .
the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the IP address default for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting if no DNS server are available . in small , completed network drives it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list of names well known calcul@@ ates some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this will still be able to replace the current version of IP in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known machine and click Add .... The dialog box will be displayed as an alternative .
to enter the name of the well @-@ known machine and click the button . if the well @-@ known machine has several alias names , the button will add several times and enter the other alias name .
choose a name of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialogue of your computer will be displayed .
it can be one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of static hosts .
the settings set in the module settings are not effective immediately . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface as a package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient for this case , but also the development program uses libraries and other things .
this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it &apos;s not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should aff@@ ord this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental networks technology will be discussed , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf can be discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace more information about IP networks . in this section , only basic information on the integration of PCs in a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) .
one of the most important information is the knowledge to address the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the networking administrator , which is available to a valid IP address , or if available , DH@@ CP can not be selected as any arbitr@@ ary !
when using a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area for this purpose , to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded in the internet , therefore its any use is possible .
of course you can access the Internet for such machines through setting a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , usually addresses are used in the area from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the mains mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things reserved , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP data line .
the address address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circuit .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; are affected and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes be dynam@@ ically modified in DSL connections , so it is then not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections , another content is specified as specified .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected to occur .

a PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a secure program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for t@@ ar , which gave the answer to a question that my wife presented : how much longer does it take ?
before a band can be used , it needs to be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done on three ways :
&amp; dat ; mo@@ il the band back and read the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing of the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ell on the band will not be asked if the band will be format@@ ted .
recogni@@ zes &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ ouse , looking for the matching index on your disk . can &apos;t be found if the Band@@ index is new to be created .
if everything has been smooth , the icon changes to the tape drive , in order to display that the band was mounted . in the Status bar , the volume of the tape can now be searched for the band through fold the entry into the band .
in front of the belt of the belt , initially the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; dat ; given by a change of symbol for the band that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the Status bar . the band can now be cast off without risk .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a tape species must be format@@ ted before you can use the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process requires that a band must be format@@ ted before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat file . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually must be format@@ ted . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require a form@@ att@@ ing of the belt ahead , D@@ AT drives .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the belt . all data on the band are lost , the band is automatically bound and is ready for use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be backed by this file or folder .
select a secure profile in tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in a local file tree with a hamm@@ am . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu Sh@@ ech@@ em ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialogue you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to backup . the dialog displays progress in the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . only select the selected file or folder .
select files in one of the archive in the record for the band with a hamm@@ am . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
as soon as the test procedure was launched , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the work folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog appears above . this dialog shows the progress of the inspection process as well as data throughput and the remainder time .
before you can re@@ boot the restore , the files must be re@@ produced , that can be marked in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder is restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a hamm@@ am . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are re@@ produced .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu button ....
once the recovery process was started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the work file for the restoration .
if you confirm the settings for re@@ build , the dialog appears re@@ produce . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput and the remainder time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the tape inde@@ x@@ file from the tape image . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of the band :
this is a secure profile with the just selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a secure profile :
the current job folders in which the backup should be made . the list of the files to be secured automatically according to the just selected procedure .
for all the folders that are listed below backup files that are only listed in the file system , just like the folder . folder , which are on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is independent of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used only , which has changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental use is used .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file in front of the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files will be secured and created a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
the settings can be set up in the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the full path to the tape drive for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ vs version of the belt device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is tied to the drive . on some drives this is necessary to read read or write operations .
if the option is turned on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; this setting is not working on tape drive . maybe this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , when soldering the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is out automatically . use this option not on flo@@ ppy drive .
if the option is enabled , trying to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware size of the tape recorder . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you &apos;ll need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is format@@ ted , write a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only be shown with a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( 1 byte ) The band ID . the format of this character string is machine name : seconds , whereby the name of the system is format@@ ted on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era has been format@@ ted in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to use a file using the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar @-@ archives that can be administ@@ er directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not an incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is mounted .
&amp; ks@@ system log ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; viewing for system protocols . the program is available for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system or where the system allows information about your system , or where the system enables fast access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background . the program is suitable for experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited on the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ system log allows users to perform fast access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; therefore trying to provide some extended functionality , which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol @-@ files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features and ks@@ ystem log ; a series of useful functions . these include amongst others :
support for many different types of protocol files , for format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included , and will be explained in the following chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo shows &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; functions available , with their help , the individual protocol rows of a protocol file easily filter and sort . the individual options for sor@@ ting and fil@@ tering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; ks@@ system log ; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol has not been displayed , so you will not open a system interface . the protocol files will normally run under Linux in the directory / var / log , for normal users normally have no permission to read .
you can also use the filter strip for fil@@ tering the filter strip , which is displayed automatically according to the selected filter setting . in the default setting , the selection box contains the selected filter . then , a protocol line will be displayed only if it is included in one of the columns the character string of the filter search engine .
you can also select a different entry at this point . in the protocol file system , select the column process , and put it in addition in the filter strip the name of a process , then shows &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; all protocol lines have been submitted and compiled by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines . protocol rows of Level Error are displayed using a remarkable colour than protocol rows of the Level Note . the color display of protocol rows can be switched off .
if you want to display specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can be useful to examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip .
in addition , you can jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new @-@ added protocol rows .
&amp; ks@@ system log ; enables you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ window and manage . once you have selected a window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ ysteme log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further current information about the supply of &amp; ks@@ system log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; also in the following folder des &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ vs : ks@@ ystem log ; in &amp; de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v .
the System V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program up to the up@@ stream of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I &apos;m not going to go on historical aspects here ( among others because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone might try to make a machine to system V in@@ it , without a new installation and new format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was there one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also distingu@@ ishes itself by the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service which allows you to run the system or change to another round level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include not such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in any part under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you need it . most systems have this file , even if it is actually not much used for this . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default level is included in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see in the initial range one line as the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ set run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair any changes , then you will repair it by rest@@ art the system and run the following :
but how does it start now all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that it &apos;s a argument that started and stop . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would keep the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script will be stop with the argument . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument .
some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server @-@ running level , that can be run only ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I also could have a user -@@ running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; you should not be hard because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to tri@@ vial tri@@ vial : simply drag one entry from the range of availability services to one of the six rounds to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift the scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by moving it differently . thereby , the entry of its original run@@ level ( or its position ) is removed . this happens if they draw an entry from the range of availability services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed if you want to copy them into a new run@@ level , you need to select copy from the menu from Edit menu or select from the context menu -- even then , if the same entry previously existed in the target area of the promotion .
the sor@@ ting number of a single entry can sometimes be calculated . in such case you have to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown in the paper basket . be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working ranges ( availability system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor buttons to make a selection above or below the previous .
to move an entry into another round , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a single entry , press the button to open the Properties dialog . connect the button to accept between different fields . connect the dialog by pressing the button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file will require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are taken in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences will be taken into the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise they are saved from &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; recovered to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c .
I tried to experiment with the standard Run@@ ners , and now it starts to re@@ build the machine . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; scheduled for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for propri@@ etary applications of this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check whether all configuration files are needed ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) are simply without message when your configuration files are not available or unt@@ rue .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send us more about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ;
after you have made changes , you have to save them . either use the respective icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry saving in the menu file .
&amp; user reviews ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cartridge maps , user and user groups . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some card cards are displayed only if you have expanded system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users enabled , a map card will appear on which you can make custom settings . other cards appear if shadow @-@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
the password administration appears if shadow @-@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
this map card only appears if enabled in at least one integrated file system ( Qu@@ ota ) enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can be changed for each user parameters , where the basic restrictions are changed in KB .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected with the help of the field &apos;s file system .
the map groups informs about the index of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , will find in the field of Pri@@ m@@ acy group . furthermore , the user can mark the user in other groups by using these in the large field .
the group features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , choose from the menu user or group or click the matching add button of the tool bar . loading or del@@ etion of the selected user or the selected group works alike .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot from the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove and change operating systems , remove and change more .
