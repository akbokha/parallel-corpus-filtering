in &amp; fs@@ view ; the size of a file size or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries can be specified . consequently , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; one entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or a folder in your file system . for sim@@ pler navigation possess the rec@@ tan@@ gles and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched on display color mode , can either display a depth for the light detection of the dis@@ closures or picture of another file names like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle with the different characteristics of the respective file or folder can be lab@@ eled if they are displayed at all , only if enough space is present , or whether the surface of sub@@ or@@ derly right is to be used ( whereby the surface error occurred due to the characters of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the label in the rectangle .
with intest@@ inal algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ apps , the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . this goal is not always kept in order to display the dis@@ solution of entries , and this frame is not always available . please note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rectangle is square .
as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains the implementation . here it is necessary for the label and to avoid footprint due to the right . the best methods are possible to be square . the best methods are related to lines , columns or Rec@@ ur@@ sive 2 .
you can set the minimal surface for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , a cra@@ ck pattern in the area of the superior was drawn to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an or@@ derly entry .

what is a digital administration management - beyond the process of fashion ? the image has been taken after the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ anned or digital photos saves a form of digital stock management . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips as you can back up , protect and photos again . we are looking for downloading , ren@@ ame , evaluate , evaluate , evaluate , ass@@ essing , real@@ ise , waiting , waiting and expor@@ ting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes on , inde@@ xed , categorized , ensures , trans@@ duc@@ ing and exported , exports and exports the one month or cultural value .
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined in accordance with your definition , information on or a documentation of other data provided by application or environment .
I have to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will do not want to know how many photos you do not want to save as well as in the image files , then you don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to save both in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archi@@ ving to access to other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need and know before you have to setup information structure in contrast to data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos will need to save whether you want to save on a reserved drive or on a network drives &amp; etc . please make sure you have to switch to a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your storage location . if you &apos;re going to organize a several times on the same place . if you want to make enough photos , then you will print sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . . export is then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as verification of photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the split of file types makes the pile @-@ processing . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . they will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to store met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ plug ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forgot this , then you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata of the database in the files by using the corresponding point in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what do you want to change and digi@@ plug ; them a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attri@@ bute . these are of course the most important .
now , the real work , since you should select every photo keywords : you can select all images that require the same attri@@ bute and enter the value . you will start the best with the rating or the leader@@ boards . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos .
let us now go with keywords , keywords , as you are frequently called in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ onym@@ s for the same thing .
if you import catalog@@ ed images from another source with embedded key@@ words , then &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically add the tree for you to mount the hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by that of a sub@@ bau@@ ms to another one . the changed pass@@ words are pursued by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while keeping the substr@@ ates .
the graphics shows like different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough representation of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ame and calendar data are characteristics of all pictures .
enough of the pass@@ words - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to kat@@ ate your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they don &apos;t want to see most often your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographer and agencies . they are safe to arrive like your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance you are not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you are closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say that this is the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the label has changed your perception of this panorama .
for other photos view the title is possibly more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story that the key is to help you to understand it about the motive that you moves you understand what you understand .
it &apos;s okay if a picture is not perfect , if it only work with a label for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can even use any text in an inter@@ national@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can even use it for a selection of images at the same time . if you want to export your images in web galleries , then they will tell you about your wishes into the label and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery . you need to tell a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing Planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train leaves the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already in@@ numer@@ able and will be able to open your journeys in the future . I can also export your journeys using Google Earth . you can also export the photos on the recording location . you can also export the pictures also to Gall@@ ery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and referred to the practice of copyright to remove limitations above the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all versions , so also for working others .
the following description says you what information is written in the setup side of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as the information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for actor and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who used the photo . if it is not desired to be the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization cannot be changed . this field does not support more Kom@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
author titles ( syn@@ onym for authors ) : linked to the author . this field contains the working number of photograph@@ ers . examples of this field contains titles as : employee photographer , free photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a ver@@ aging to the authority field , this is also to be filled out .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify who . if the photographer is working here as a Reuters or Associated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is an inventory photo , then the Group / Agency will be given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections . everyone who has no longer than basic knowledge in the work with computer has to delete or change the solution for this problem . for individuals this problem is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ marks is unique in the picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the near future there is a module for stack@@ ing processing .
topics : turn@@ errors , plate loss , EC@@ C , transmission error , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , lifetime , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that you can also pass on traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which have a loss of data .
to fight the problem at CDs / DVDs , you need to keep them longer than a few years . of course you can get more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers about Gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece can claim a lifetime of 100 years for himself . if you believe this is in your creation space .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you &apos;re writing a lot of reliable . it is therefore the right to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very reasonable for errors , even if you are just written only . therefore , they use a control environment to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the remainder we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection it is necessary by chemical age@@ ing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a good program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux . it &apos;s also available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all things to CDs and DVDs was also applicable to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn the data to a high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ quality media . then , you should select the media with a description , date &amp; author &apos;s name and thereafter . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ wering producers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantee a new disk , but not the data . Google sets a great field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ ppy disk drives .
in brief : dis@@ ks keep the longest trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting . electronic parts of the controller are dramatic . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error messages , SM@@ ART cannot termin@@ ate this error . some of SM@@ ART specified error messages . this is especially Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power if you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be produced without major problems .
while most electrical devices power supply does not make a lot of power , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause these anom@@ ali@@ es , complete data loss , hard@@ war@@ ms , mother@@ boards , and other defects . protect themselves in front of the inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed by a part of the energy heat and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug bar . remember that not any connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that it guarantees the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures that he offers protection against lightning and thus protects the right connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should also be aware that all the periph@@ er@@ als can also be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide a phone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ eb@@ ooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system is used in front of smaller variations in the current lines . even a few seconds can lead you to the loss of adverse data . it can be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltages , these devices can automatically set up rechargeable battery power . however , some models allow you to save up to the current . if you have a US@@ V , you should be sure that they might get the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to avoid your computer system and compare his safety at electricity disorders with the cost of avoi@@ ding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think so that you should always keep all cables about tr@@ enne before you travel into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store your amounts of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB , and you will not get your images in full resolution . the professional version will you get more available , in case of fli@@ ck@@ r . for $ 25 a year you will get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed only in reality .
from the view@@ point of data backup are the Web solutions very secure . transmission error will automatically include a backup and a partial memory in the offer . so they are Des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in computer . all transfers are due for transmission error . fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs adjust at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard disk .
the worst is that no one has occurred if a data transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have no protection . no one seems to have thought to have . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently affected by transmission problems you should look at the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs each year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL In@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows released . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses the z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
these two factors are not under@@ estimate ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at workplace systems . if not@@ eb@@ ooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the chis@@ els . it is limited to a lower damage , e.g. theft or re@@ install@@ ations . it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users are only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer sung .
open source file systems are less expensive for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the trial process during one operation is higher and a defin@@ itive status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that the technology is further developed for this progress . sensitivity and rough@@ ness to all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go up to the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els sensors . even if this resolution is already deterior@@ ated for compact cameras and the end result . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ apix@@ els and a high quality optics are rather deterior@@ ated . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 megapixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ size sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk drive is responsible for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not have any other data loss for data loss . thus secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash be@@ ats you lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster suggests locally , and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or whole house .
therefore , deser@@ tion is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your sick@@ le up the stairs to enter into the neighboring house in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are secured to be secured . it is a moment without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : one backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . this creates a complete moment up to two time points : the complete backup and the final differentiation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can produce the original status in any time . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception that it is only ab@@ get@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily setup your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer@@ ring encoding r@@ sync is only the difference of the files that were really changed . this happens if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
secure your important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach gives you enough time to discover losses and again . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment for every month . each additional th@@ inner should be done manually after which you have a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , associated with X@@ MP files , associated X@@ MP files , original keep , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ find pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , use of the internet .
to survive valuable pictures for the next 40 years , it is about the time span in which you really interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table and evaluate it all today . unfortunately , there is no other way to do so . all 5 @-@ 8 years should ask oneself like the current system back@@ ward . if less variants you have used in the past , so it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for any use . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then store it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time when you can change your computer architecture , your memory and back@@ ing technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the trade pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
let us go from which you have the scal@@ ability with which you have set the scal@@ ability with a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section to a new record :
check out with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record is detected by the system , but do not hang them up .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and travel FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sh@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software you can read , then you can create this yourself . this task is easier by year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that van@@ ishes slowly from the market . therefore you should not use it anymore .
PNG was created as an open source standard which should replace GIF . it can be much more . it is loss free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ ad@@ ata . the dis@@ advantage is that there is relative many administration information , but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression . this format would you like to save your pictures .
TIFF was widespread as picture format . TIFF can store images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can save your images in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted for many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open raw processing format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the need of camera data formats . a hand@@ fully camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace the &amp; quot ; extensions of the 90 &apos;s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information are allowed to enter into a file itself . the file information can be stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers leave it in front of a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , the met@@ ad@@ ata stores separately from the file format . however , it can be found to use problems with lin@@ king between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that support a wide range of applications and business models . to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and trans@@ figured efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ at@@ ew@@ ards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures can use on the camera , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a sensitive processing , you can use external programs . if you add the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut off by the other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , code you in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in paragraph add a description how you can already add photos you can already add on your hard disk . the camera interface provides you but many advanced settings for impor@@ ting pictures to your album bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect these with the computer , turn the camera to display mode and switch it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a distance of any photos can be displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file extension for any file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . you can see the features of the camera and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a single entry and met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog displays file characteristics and the photo information connected to the camera . a symbol shows that the picture has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have any information available .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remarks , GPS etc . these information are the same as the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click here to download and then choose from all . these invites all photos from their camera to a single album and we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to download in a album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos you can only download the desired using the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button to download and then selected file . the button selected is long as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a option is available for download . these pictures have been selected now until now . in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance window . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you use the buttons to download or selected file , a dialog appears to be stored on the photos . the list of existing albums will be sorted as normal folder . details on the folder you can read in section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the button . if you want to delete all the button , you must select this first and delete them to delete .
please note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera . they should not be deleted by the camera . if you want to delete the photos successfully into a &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you want to delete the photos successfully in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you want to delete the camera if you want to delete the camera option , because this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often do not have any meaning@@ ful names . this may lead to double fil@@ en@@ ame , if you have taken photos of different recording series into the same album . therefore it can be meaning@@ ful , the date and time to integrate the picture in which the image has been added to the file names .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the image and for data @-@ based under@@ lines . if you use this latter option , will automatically be created a folder per day .
the options During the transmission opens three further options that will be performed before the photos on the board . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you wish to use another file format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % % H : % M : % S . switch the date &amp; time to use . for more custom@@ ization you should read the help of the command time .
if you use the camera file names , you have the option to change the file names in small letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; for a photo is displayed below the name , the camera is displayed in the preview . your settings are stored and automatically used when you can open the camera for the next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can do all information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during the download . do not all cameras provide this information . in the section side bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has been embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is normally enabled , and when your camera does not deliver this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatically , use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
if your camera was done on which the picture has been made available , and digi@@ plug ; this sub@@ al@@ ds are based on the image album . all images with the same date are loaded on the same lower album . do not all cameras provide this information . in the section side bar Meta Data , you can read what information can be embedded into the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly to the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button Extended and select there the date @-@ based under@@ stand@@ ings at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from their computer to her camera is button to download . choose the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; it appears where you can select the files that can be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you &apos;ll ask where the images should be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera . choose the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position in length and lat@@ itude , which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographs , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to play an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agencies can use this ability .
if you forgot to have exactly the photo , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users want to loc@@ alize the place of the photos , or simply want to document the position of the photos , it is good to add the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a follow @-@ up of GPS data and image files to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera which has integrated GPS unit . but there is a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel . you need to save these data in the GP@@ X format , since this is the only format that is supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and GPS and cor@@ related . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length of length or lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the coordin@@ ating coordinates that can be created by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; tries much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that you access the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to setup this settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
action can be installed on embedded preview or image processing . they set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed when you click on a record in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard and legal data . this data will be written automatically into the respective IP@@ TC data fields . this data is written when downloading from the camera data . also in case of data ban@@ ks@@ yn@@ chron@@ ous , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for authors of the photographer . this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be used as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since that is an additional description on the author , this also must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author if this is a picture agency like Reuters or Associated Press . if the picture is an inventory photo , then the group or agency should be shown here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the respective IP@@ TC rim . this is that the met@@ ad@@ ata permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without lost .
images saved as a embedded certificate ( J@@ F@@ IF ) to JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can read about your photos , with the images of the images . therefore , your labelling can be read from other images . please note : in pictures , they are already written by the &amp; fix@@ ings .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window over a file . according to the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which data types &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to set the file extensions of this list and remove any file in one &amp; digi@@ plug ; Alb@@ um@@ Fol@@ der , which has no one of these extensions , is igno@@ red by &amp; digi@@ plug ; igno@@ red .
the default settings can be set back again by clicking the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the beam can be set on this page . every time you can open this settings if possible . some pictures have different sizes and syn@@ ch@@ rone mode . if you have different sizes and syn@@ ch@@ rone mode , you should only use only for fast computers . if you have one , then you can receive a better performance results .
by default , image processing has used a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch this here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and over@@ exposed areas of a picture can be selected with dark or bright colour in the picture . these colours are specified here . in the image processing can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images can be encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation .
with the setup of PNG , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation reduces the image quality , since PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TIFF file compressed , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF @-@ pictures . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not reduce the size of the TIFF images . it does not have influence on the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss .
with the setting @-@ off JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you have written the loss of loss and file size better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was not yet supported , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but it was planned in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug ; the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very fast to a tool for man@@ ipulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , this difference is a little bit slower than the image . this option is a little soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ pattern with V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white image is used as the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance that was photograph@@ ed on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that the over@@ exposed images added more details in four steps . for other cameras this option will ignore this option .
the standard is the top speed , so the parts of your images are cap@@ tive to view the setting @-@ in white in the settings . you can also use the setting through some unusual results since they can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the cont@@ enders .
this is possible because blue pixels in general can &apos;t be satisfied as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ w should therefore try the missing green and red shares that are not yet designed to re@@ construct blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you will get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; this can also be done later in order to keep the time for the demo version , you should keep con@@ serv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ dem algorithm is a digital image process to add a complete picture from the partial color data that presents many cameras and the Matrix colour pixels is well known . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and d@@ cra@@ b provide you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ v . it is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color soft of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since you will be carried out during the raw material .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and are instructions as to be given back . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information like the color information from a colour space to the other , so the colors are as exactly as possible .
behavior Questions if a picture is opened in the image processing is starting / color scheme module with raw files .
click here to select the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; examined this file then during the Star@@ ts .
settings of the ICC profiles have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the display conditions is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures color manages not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be able to use the camera manufacturer and model you can fit . do not contain all profiles are produced on the same type . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not need for conver@@ sions at 16 bits depth . this means that you need to perform the paint ton@@ gs itself .
there are other options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of @-@ profile , which you can em@@ ulate picture , as your printer can print a smaller color range as your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . this could manually correct instead of the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that the colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles can be fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style of the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface , supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image processing and image processing is supported ; many modules support which have been written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . if you want to use &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and also in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the advance .
dumb@@ bell for tasks that are conducted by modules can be set up in the menu under the settings .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted between the image inputs , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check box switch the met@@ ad@@ ata , or from the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera features indicate a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is tried to identify a camera that is connected to the computer , switched on and in the image settings . currently , the port settings are currently enabled , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt , specify on which you hang on your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer to switch and switch on display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after your camera set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than a camera , you can add all here .
with the option review dialog for shi@@ fting &gt; Pictures at the gar@@ bage can display the conversation of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when delete a photos into a album . in the sections of delete a photos and del@@ etion of a Alb@@ ums you will find further details .
the editorial changes can be shut down through &amp; digi@@ plug ; when you use the option changes in the right side bar without any feedback . otherwise , you need to use the changes with the button changes .
you can also read the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ plug ; it accelerates the start time of &amp; digi@@ plug ; it accelerates from &amp; digi@@ ous circumstances .
the setting when you are looking for new photos and digi@@ plug ; the basic folder to new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when something was deleted from the base folder , it asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can delete it out of the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to adapt the main window to your taste . this settings can choose under the settings of the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be printed at the bottom :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; so they are not part of your distribution . for further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in section image processing .
a status line at the lower edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current record number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . no the functions will change the original photo , before using file saving or the button Save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture .
so you should get a copy of your image before you change it . you can Save with file Save as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by removing the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store .
almost any action of image processing can be made and re @-@ manufactured or recovered . the last action can be re@@ structured or re @-@ manufactured , using editing from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the scanning shorter , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to the reverse and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press a context menu on the back or restore button in the tool bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all promotions are made between also and recovered .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or same key@@ word by using the navigation system in the tool bar , image , below or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes in the current photo you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can in the photo in and out of zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ est menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . if you don &apos;t want to use this tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want to change this in the setup dialog . you can view this in the setup dialog ; see the section to setup the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image file and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or full sentences . you need to select images with the standard methods and select from the menu album expor@@ ting printing assistant . if you follow the assistant , you will need only to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar at the right edge that is important information and actions available for the selected pictures . the same side bar is available without the navigation system , even in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders will be clicked on :
multiple Click on the same rider , the side bar will appear or disappear in the edge .
in the labelling of view you can enter or insert the note below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are formed after 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
after you commented on , you will either use the button users or switch to the next picture , the labelling will be stored then .
in addition to the user button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata of the selected file or the database . but this will always be done if you choose a met@@ ad@@ ata setting that is always written into the pictures .
the section evaluation shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the scanning shorter C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied on a picture . to rate several pictures at the same time , select this from and use the context menu .
the rating is written into the IP@@ TC field error . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word shows a search box for the words of the key@@ words , the key@@ word @-@ tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; session requested words .
the key@@ word @-@ tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the appropriate search word . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many words .
the input field at the lower end is another relief at the input of samples in a picture series . if you have entered different key@@ words , these are stored for fast access .
key@@ word may also be placed by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if more images are selected in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section Key@@ word filters .
the side@@ bar code filter is used to change the selection of the displayed window with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views . if in addition one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the quantity quantity of these two are displayed . all created words are available .
you can also touch keywords and lay them . suppose you have several images selected to drag you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears to ask if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on one calendar day . the key@@ word means that the amount is selected on three pictures . they were selected with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards it was filed a key@@ word out of the right key@@ word . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . you can also be switched on settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it would be one or to be , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the rules range .
( 1 ) : the record , after which is sought in the database . this may be a album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can define a further search about all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button . then see the options as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ plug ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one of your camera or scanner is based on a predic@@ table deviation from the most of your camera or scanners , you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners , and that you can print the colors or in the web , which comply with your digital dark Chamber .
if the topic is coming on color management , then everyone knows what buttons is to express . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with any point of image processing . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own inform@@ ational decisions to make you the desired results .
if your image processing all listed below the criteria listed below , then you must not take care of color management .
you can work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the RGB colour space . ( more information see below )
your only other picture editions are per e @-@ mail or the web , where the RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if so RGB is so good and life for all so easy , why should you use another color space to make a different color space , so that you need to make a color noise ?
a visual example of lim@@ iting from s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ ar@@ en@@ ical region , and the colors in the RGB Far@@ space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour flowers , you are visiting Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms side and then click on info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to al@@ locate my monitor , if I decided to work in the RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the RGB colour space or not , you have to get your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ert . if you work as in the color space of s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the RGB standard k@@ alli@@ bri@@ m , a pass@@ able monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . use it therefore before you try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , equal , Automatic and contrast extend from the menu correct Automatic correction automatically to make your colors the best . they are experim@@ enting with these effects , to see what works best at your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled through the entire image , so the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its colours . this function is often an Mag@@ ical correction for images the dark or balanced .
same method : this method is adjusted to the LEDs of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the selected image is so flat as possible . in this way , there is a very good results in the improvement of a picture , sometimes it produces only gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful surgery which causes either miracle in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blu@@ epr@@ int . it determines the dark and bright bound@@ aries and adjust the red , green and blu@@ kan@@ äle to the complete hist@@ o@@ lic@@ ences .
contrast expand : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by the one &apos;s lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new ji@@ re@@ ation of all values . this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white edge of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white drain of a photos .
the White @-@ equal correction is a bit limited by a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can perform a color space with over@@ load exposure . if you are working with over@@ load exposure . if you are working with over@@ load exposure . if you work in the white mode , your possibilities will be able to get better .
this tool is based on a white equivalent algorithm to copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . it is starting with the menu entry colors white equal to image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of tool . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ ance , then it is enough to click the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram , once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , most pixel very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on sh@@ adows , saturation and Gamma . the sh@@ adows can be improved or down the shadow of your photos or down .
An@@ stat with the above controls are used , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and afterwards somewhere on the picture to use the color temperature of the white equivalent . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed indicators increases the colors if more than one colour channel of the Pix@@ els are over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in white image . this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons Save as and load make it exactly this . each setting of the white equ@@ ali@@ es you can now save in a text file and later load it again .
the button pres@@ crip@@ tions sets all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white equivalent . note that even neutral settings can be set to another photo as your original . if you want to save this original image .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the mach@@ ined picture . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . this coding is also required for high quality images . this coding is also required for high quality images . these coding are also required for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour tension can be done by the base window for the use of color profiles , you can draw the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu of colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make you the same mist@@ akes and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for pitch correction you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility of exposure problems to correct is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ective provides you four colour effects , a Vel@@ via filter , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter available .
in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the picture was completed . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were completed by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controlled the solar panel . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image which is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase will finally generate a negative image that is so not to produce on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it diff@@ ers from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and smooth . try it easy , it emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors with daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via provides great saturated colors , but also some photographs , especially those who are barely scen@@ eries , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repet@@ itions . in large pictures , the filter can re@@ load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you can try the color con@@ tr@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . all your adjustment can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , you can use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you have a photo of bad light conditions , you can get a good choice for brightness . even in this case the tool is a good choice for saturation . all changes you can perform in preview . if Him don &apos;t like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ ment / contrast / Gamma / Gamma is the tool to improve the exposure . also if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of the sli@@ der . specifically the three slides below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected section . under the graphite , three sl@@ ums are exposed to the image and the left side represents the dark side and the right side represents the light areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and change it on the same as the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically , using the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is often displayed . for pictures of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three regulator : the top for the dark tones , the medium for bright tones , and the lowest for medium tones , frequently gam@@ ma@@ values called .
the three colour pin pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each range . there are also two knob , the output values can be inter@@ active as with the input values . the compression of the output values can be used , for example , the compression values can be used as background , while something else can be seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : this button will automatically set the picture values automatically depending on intensity values of the image .
save and store : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and later re@@ loaded later . it is used to use the Gim@@ p level format .
if you use these mode and the three shades , the input values will automatically be adjusted automatically for all sh@@ adows , medium and sun@@ shine , click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ o , green , blu@@ epr@@ ints and lumin@@ osity .
the over@@ exposed indicators will receive all kinds of color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you will get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of alignment the input values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image ( 2 ) .
on the left @-@ hand side , half of the origin@@ als and the target image is displayed . the preview will be dynamic in dependence of your settings . on the right side are the following options available :
modifications channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are changing between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , linear mode has produced a wide beam . in this case , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a cur@@ ator according to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that this bright tones can be correspon@@ dent and corresponding to the associated image pixel .
on the preview of the original photos , a red marking is visible . if you want to change this marking on the curve , a matching line is shown on the curve which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off , until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save and store : using these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve can be stored in the file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p course format .
if you want to use this method and the three color pet@@ als automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun@@ shine . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the rotor , green , blu@@ epr@@ int and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposed indicators will display all kinds of color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will get the combined result . this is , that you can only see the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun@@ shine was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and correct ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is a further developed tool to mix the colour shades of the images . you can process it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can choose the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels . the left area of the window shows you a preview of the original can be viewed for comparison via the own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you see this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels as if you also enable the option of Mon@@ och@@ rome , since the channel mixer is used to create a great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you come to mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a colour comes with a visible noise that looks at the same place in the colour channel and their cra@@ cks in each channel . if this is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion , which allows you to reduce the far@@ thing .
the Save as and charging buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any bl@@ ender adjustment allows you to save and then load the file format is the Gim@@ p channel format .
the over@@ exposed indicators will receive all kinds of color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you will get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in the blue channel . the L@@ umin@@ anz option is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this picture has been shown below ( 2 ) .
black / White photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , since colour pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / W film @-@ exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / W film @-@ exposure with a orange link filter . this improved landscapes , marine scenes and air photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ ge@@ filters .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / W movie exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate moon light for the day of time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ate filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / W movie exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces hot bright and medium tones during a bit cold in the sh@@ att@@ age . this is very similar to the procedure of a pressure and re@@ development in a se@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like a painting of an old master , a pop kind of portrait from enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right to the right to the depth or three dimensional stability of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been used on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the relief is set to 200 .
add the &amp; digi@@ plug ; the tool can add a decorative frame to a picture .
the eye of a viewer &apos;s eye to keep in the borders of a photos is not easy to maintain its attention . this is a psychological barrier for scat@@ tering eye . this is a psychological barrier for scat@@ tering eye . under picture frame the module can be started under image processing .
type : with this parameter , you can adjust the desired frame type for your image . through a large line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , it is ideal for a nice three @-@ dimensional effect and decor@@ atively add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : the width of the frame is in percent . the range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this is bigger than the original , but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool for aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple to insert text in a picture on any spot . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . enter the text , orientation , color from the color space and character set with its properties like you need . if you want to adjust the drawing size of the image size . at the end you can simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed , up to the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the image has been saved once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mould template , you can apply a template on a picture .
the menu picture St@@ ones use template in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture .
for sten@@ cil there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . you need to add to the size of the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil and digi@@ plug ; send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you use this tool to use this tool , you need to set your templates folder with the button Base folder . select here the folder you have to copy the template files . this settings are indicated for the next start .
after the root folder for the templates has been placed a building view which automatically reflects the folder of the template &apos;s structure . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and change the position of your image .
Enlarge : this knob increases the dar@@ under@@ lying picture . it is cent@@ ered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
resi@@ zed : this knob resi@@ zed among them the lying image . if you want to use the position of the mouse . if you want to use the template on the whole picture , you need to reduce the picture to the left . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and lay it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the sten@@ cil onto your image . the image will then be adapted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; three different tools are available for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you have advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
im@@ shar@@ p@@ ic mask works on the contrast of the edges to look back a picture . actually it is no bit slower , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to play atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
reproduction is possibly the best of the three because it really improved the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images require a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . elements the smaller than the resolution must be printed , so that the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . SLR cameras does not need to be printed on paper . SLR cameras usually require more than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG pictures often an camera has been used for internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the raw format is always to be used during processing .
some scanners turn a shar@@ pen@@ se filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this de@@ activate , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value . this allows you to correct the shar@@ pen@@ ing shar@@ pen@@ ing .
this should be careful however , because the results are not very natural , the shar@@ p@@ ness increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , you can easily adjust the tool to control the tool . under realis@@ m , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ y . the solution to correct the image is much easier than shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool to sof@@ ar sof@@ ar and experim@@ enting with the menu . the presentation window on the right side of the dialog indicates you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove the veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help the picture . the presentation window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values generate good results and should be tried first . an increasing radius or amount should be tried . if you make the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ic mask to make a noise , and generate the impression of tom@@ bs in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius indicates how many pixels on each side of a ridge is affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignor@@ ant image , which is added to the original . thereby the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB value and to the apply differential amount . one can define a minimum difference to the edge of the filters . this way , areas with a soft change between the killing of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauty defect shall be avoided .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked picture ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red painting was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; the tool re@@ focus on a painting by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used to be protected by copyright by copyright protected by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to drive a picture to &amp; quot ; it &apos;s better approach as to try the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ess . it uses usually better results as un@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can start it out of the menu by pressing colors editing in image processing .
in practice the circular saw is much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s barrel . the Gau@@ ge has a very long tail , which leads far from the original qu@@ ell@@ um , which is far influenced by the original qu@@ ell@@ um . the F@@ IR Vi@@ ews is influenced in most cases , which causes un@@ desirable results .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be extremely bl@@ ur@@ red , but if your image should be extremely bl@@ ur@@ red .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation was reduced the shar@@ ply effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the space filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 is helpful . however , 0 is very bad . if the noise filter is very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . use this parameter to avoid un@@ shar@@ ply filter . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying ar@@ te@@ as . if you have a value un@@ equal zero , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . if you choose large values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . however , please note that module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and charging buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter which you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try all of the cut , color and intensity correction on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you can change the picture elsewhere . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not visible immediately , but that later left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , eg . JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by a greater neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it has to produce in@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the im@@ pet@@ itions . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese Filter , it is always the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ters always just as well as the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ic mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Filter is often better than the processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp paint image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to un@@ enough light to the auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods of shar@@ p@@ ec@@ or@@ tion in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob of the controller puts the shar@@ p@@ ness of the area in order to generate a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ te allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool @-@ error correction is one of the most frequently developed tool to remove the arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ ner algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy restoration . the available pres@@ ets are below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the riders and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass over the image . what to obtain greater values mainly homogen@@ eous regions and details sharp . a value of 0.9 should be found that no shar@@ pen@@ alties is necessary . please note that there should be a shar@@ pen@@ sive disorder always .
directional alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value of smooth evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ven , or CCD smoke will produce a high value of w@@ ish@@ able pattern . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be removed best at a value nearby 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value as a degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is necessary , the more is required if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm will pass through . usually lasts 1 or 2 .
angle meas@@ urer da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , it should also be small . note that small angle should generate a long runtime . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel glasses and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more about quality that you can get through the choice of this option is only low . it doubles the running time . we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons Save as and load make it exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be stored into a text file and later be loaded later .
image error correct is compar@@ atively very fast when working . but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button closure .
below you can see how to remove image error with little ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is used in a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is an independent black arti@@ facts during the journey caused by a bad film storage during the journey . ( 1 ) to see and correct image under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; smoking production is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a protected protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filter to come to the spot and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor smo@@ kers from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ins ; effects from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor smo@@ kers of digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ cking space that can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ window details and the lower advanced settings can remain at the default settings .
radius controls the windows size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can be adjusted the image below the picture and the color in it is smoo@@ ther and thus smaller bugs .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to the front is to be deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image data may not get more and cra@@ dle or sm@@ ashing it again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the shar@@ p@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , it cannot occur at a value of the maximum , if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either a colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . this settings does not affect the application process by the details pane .
color : controls the color toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either a colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . this settings does not affect the application process by the details pane .
gamma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas that are typically stronger , however , it is cont@@ am@@ inated too .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges will appear . if he is on his minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear to edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for smo@@ kers that you have set , can be saved in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and correct with ( 2 ) and the smo@@ kers was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ y for your purpose . this solution , the image is a bit soft to draw , fortunately it is much easier than a painting with the menu entry correct and experim@@ enting with the gluten . the presentation window on the right side of the dialog indicates the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo rest@@ ration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo@@ journalist .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility of removing un@@ desirable arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to immer@@ se yourself in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alised images into digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alised images . the smoo@@ ther is made along the image con@@ tours and makes it the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tured pixels . the algorithm is developed using another tool , the image error correction , developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ingen and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and load make it exactly this . any adjustment of photo rest@@ ration may hereby be stored into a text file and later be loaded later .
photo rest@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast when working . but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce how to reduce a photo with equal noise . the module is applied on a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can recognize the not@@ orious film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and correct under ( 2 ) .
below you can see a further example of the photo rest@@ ration . this time , tex@@ tures can be reduced to an old color photo , which was compiled with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts from the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ illumination and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and correct image under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tools Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel of photos that were built with a CCD camera . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ ens .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially suitable for high @-@ quality raw mode photos , since many cameras with JPEG compression has a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the assistant with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the correct image . please note that the assistant will notice the last dar@@ ken@@ ess and automatically load this automatically in the next session .
the picture range and the preview can help you correct within the picture . the presentation window shows the output of the fil@@ tering with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the felt . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
thirst : it is determined an average of the neighboring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is used separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of pixel block will be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block is pulled to a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all Pixel with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is visible under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; vig@@ net@@ ti@@ bility correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. interrupted corners , a picture to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can &apos;t be evenly spread the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reach the corners and edges of the image by adding the light to the sensor . Tel@@ e@@ objective show under conditions also show this behaviour .
but he has also dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at aperture filters , which should be impossible with hand . wide angle lens should also be able to use with Center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise im@@ shar@@ ply effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and color scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by simul@@ ating the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter . the tool contains vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction , the tool is protected by a c@@ enter@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regulations you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light @-@ ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2.0 , what a optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting . reduce it by a small degree of compression .
leu@@ k@@ strength , contrast and Gamma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . you need only increase positive values , as you need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine tuning of the exposure of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a leu@@ k@@ ins@@ ke@@ - and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar rounded effect , fl@@ atten@@ ed to the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient of Gra@@ des correc@@ ts the distant edges opposite to the second degree . if you combine these two different geomet@@ ric distortion is almost eliminated .
generally , this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tonn@@ age can be corrected and positive values are k@@ is@@ fied distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the distortion . this value is stronger than change than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the re@@ mark of the parameter in General .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads through a correction of first gra@@ des . negative values increase during positive the picture .
brigh@@ ter : this value is adjusted in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values improve it .
to help you help the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview of distor@@ ted correction . values for your image are saved and using the next start as default values .
the tonn@@ age or k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes . best , you perform this correction as all first through . if you need a painting and carry out a tonn@@ age correction would be the effect of the effect of the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you help the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot . in the connection you can correct the tonn@@ age / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct the resulting image of black corners . you can remove these with the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu transformers , remove from the image processing or through the zoom knob of this dialog .
for most pictures the tonn@@ age is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like e.g. recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so correct to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you keep the camera with hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tonn@@ age @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ enn@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is based on this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can choose the range for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters set film gra@@ ins and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO knob changes the amount of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter can@@ als for re@@ produce infrared film , particularly the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information are missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter format on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and this image has been shown below ( 1 ) and the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of A@@ ura in the setting .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter film gra@@ ven is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films and mixing large silver gra@@ ins of the phot@@ emul@@ sion .
the film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems back to the past . the treated image gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere lo@@ osed from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic view , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , then you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film gra@@ ins to a black / W image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regulator to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick@@ ly brushes are suitable for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the glass or , from the other side are considered the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the paper is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large image is 1 and Gl@@ ue 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity minist@@ ered to create a carbon@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . they are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you choose what scene would have chosen you to sc@@ ari@@ ze you . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two knob with a range of values from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( glass ) .
this is an example of the charcoal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can still be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving your image in 3 @-@ D when it was stamped in wax . it uses a protected protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give up your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very good at pictures with a simple structure , where color does not use the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey scenery .
the depth allows to set the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example for the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the original image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by using a distortion effects . it uses protected algorith@@ ms of pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : share the picture in cells and will look like whether it is characterized by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ously to the shaft blocks 1 , the image will be distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work with im@@ shar@@ p@@ ic effects . it uses protected algorith@@ ms of pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : ignor@@ ant the image along the steep lines out of a central point . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ic camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radical im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : ignor@@ ant the image by rotation of the pixel by a central point . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ation of a turning camera .
distances : ignor@@ ant the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera . the object seems back in the background .
motion @-@ shar@@ p@@ ness : ignor@@ ant the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear move , z : B : from a car or train to photograph , camera .
turn@@ able im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : ignor@@ ant the picture soft in dark and strong in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , Gl@@ amour @-@ photos or add a warm and sub@@ tle light .
Schüt@@ tel@@ un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : ignor@@ ant the image by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ation of a arbitr@@ ary camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the image and ignor@@ ant these without the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish button .
the ra@@ is@@ rop@@ es are a nice little tool to make Reg@@ ul@@ rop@@ es on your image . this makes it natural your images a n@@ igh@@ ty look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows to change the size of the trop@@ ics . since the trop@@ ic size is not automatically reduced with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish stock changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can use &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing a range from Reg@@ rop@@ rop@@ es . use the range of tool to choose the area , e.g. a vision that should stay free . if you start the filter , the range will stay free of shelves .
this is an example of the regul@@ ators Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the working image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the picture has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ations turning or with spi@@ ke .
photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimum loss of image quality .
a painting is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture when the limits of dis@@ solution can be found ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo set the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ able size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog box is below .
the tool can change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ins Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; used a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorithm Photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider Neue Size and are shown below :
aspect ratio should be retained : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original size will be retained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is necessary , the more is required if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and load will be used exactly . each insertion for photo can be stored as text file and later be loaded later .
photo shooting is very fast when it makes , but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example for photo shooting by clicking a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photos is not only a common operation , but also an frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , using the mouse button and drag the rectangle , you will see this rectangle with your mouse while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . this allows you to change the size of the right . you can draw the size of the rectangle , by removing the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button closure button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or file Save under the menu to save the newly created photo .
in the pre@@ set area , you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio will be defined in the dialog .
in the tool for aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or trans@@ verse format . in high format , the larger value of the height and the trans@@ verse format is assigned to the width .
the tool can be cut into the aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you use centimeters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog box you can use the Max . ratio knob the range for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool then cut the tool according to aspect ratio ( Horizontal or vertical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the picture and not the original image .
the settings of the compositions enable you to bl@@ ending your pictures even better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are designed to divide a rectangle in similarly harmon@@ ious triangles at the diagonal .
golden mid : the golden middle is a split which is based on different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of the Naut@@ ilus shell or the bl@@ ossom leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we find as beautiful .
the golden partition is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to build your temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you use your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number runs from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . one composition measures this rule is considered visual harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle provides liquid aid lines when you create a picture . this help is drawn down below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third party , the golden spiral line creates a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden spiral . it should be something that the eye can be in the heart of the composition . it can be a line with or different objects . this something can be simply because his eye to lead , it will fulfill its task .
the golden triangles also guide the top points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to these lines can be a static object of dynamic .
if you use golden triangles around your frame , create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious part .
using button colour you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . this type can adjust the color of the lines your current picture .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easy to adjust the camera to exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . you can manually repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . choose the transformer and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . by default the sli@@ der can be set to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right above .
to help you make the module free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview for both lines . after you fix it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ desirable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is the function transformers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatic . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option cap@@ tures a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ imeter transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the center of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will be re @-@ calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas which are created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas which are created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : displays the current angle in degrees to the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little bit dirty . for a single adaptation is this effect small , but two adjustments generate a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after completing the perspective , you can get in@@ able tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a possibility to cover it is the picture with transformation cut out of the image processing .
the mould tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the lower part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is distor@@ ted . with other words , a rectangle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformers .
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pre@@ ferences , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed on you and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right .
to help you get a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the mold tool to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the picture , the image becomes a bit anno@@ ying . for a single shot , this effect is usually neg@@ le@@ gible , but two deposits generated twice as much as you should avoid this .
after crossing the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an option to eliminate it is the picture with transformation into the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats , therefore from your system and , in some cases , from the way how these libraries have been comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you can process a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system file formats , but they will always be JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; shows only files in formats to know . this is done by the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the file extension is displayed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions and digi@@ plug ; in the section configuration you can find further information .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select to select the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smoo@@ ther results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format , you can read in Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw processing of &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section configuration you can find information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the shop of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials used by &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are frequently stored in Avi@@ o or MPEG format ; but it is not possible to display movies . &amp; digi@@ plug ; but when you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies are used to start the program for playback .

K@@ IP@@ I module exported a range of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened with Google Earth Earth and displayed .
if you do steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white .
many tools you need the picture processing are in &amp; digi@@ plug ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , rough@@ ness , im@@ perfor@@ ated , un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ masters , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect on the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog box :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the stock area . these modes are :
vertically split without duplic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter is applied to the right of the chosen area .
horizont@@ ally share without duplic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter used in the area below the chosen area .
vertically split . the left area shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally share . the upper section shows the original and lower to the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the incident and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to over@@ load and over@@ load exposure . the use colors can be adapted in the general installation page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose from preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image and place on the part of the image , from which you want to see the preview . the preview of the dialog box will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all the settings of the last use of the module are noticed .
the side bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely declared . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters on the shoot of the photos . these dates are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull up a square . read all images within this coordinates must be filtered and displayed . this puts of course your images of G@@ eo data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and to select colors and use colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and added colors .
in the dialog box , you can choose from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it shows the color next to the colour . the colour is described under the pallet view . here the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse at an impressive left mouse button .
if the check box B@@ m cur@@ sor is inserted under the button colour , the color is selected either inserted or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can be set by using the check box over@@ write under the cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; col@@ oring dit ; used the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line sign , if there are three numerical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ ore@@ dit .
the colors in the range and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a colour somewhere on the screen and then you can find it on the left .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic format between the individual images . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slides .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can choose the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . for burning the media you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images that will be packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . then you can start the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . if you &apos;re using the video format , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD file , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds which is indicated in seconds . a lower value is generated , very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file . keep you as possible if possible .
if you specify a audio file using the name of the audio source file , then you can start downloading the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee or drink all the rest of a coffee and enjoy the slides back when you return back .
if a hint appears that co@@ sting or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Packages to the right below .
the printing assistant allows you to print several images on a paper sheet together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is useful to improve it or print using the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your data stored in the RAW format stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original size of Him is : expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ p better results ! .
first choose the RAW file to convert and start the module . the R@@ aw image conversion window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conver@@ gent process . the first option decides , whether the camera settings can be used in white or blue . if the result is not optimal , if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches no effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and storing the conversion speed . the file name remains equal to and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a reliable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image format , TIFF , reserves the information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W comp@@ ressing .
if you want to edit your pictures frequently , or later , you should not use the JPEG format , since there are only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are stored in the RAW file , in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can break down this process .
the stack@@ ing processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode if you &apos;re safe , e.g. by testing on a single picture that are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , this is helpful if they have produced this in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in a album . it uses the program convert from the image Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the time .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the image Mag@@ ick package . you can download the image or enlarge it . 4 types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to custom@@ ize your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ preparation : prepare the picture for the photo print . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , including background size , edge size and background colour is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your preferred E @-@ mail program . it is possible to change the size of the most important pictures before . more images can be put on the list of the pictures and lay down there .
after you started the module , the picture window will be displayed by you selected pictures . over the button pictures you can add further pictures with a file selection dialog . for the last image , a preview will be displayed on the right side .
you can also go to the picture list and add the list to add images to the list .
with the button pictures , the selected pictures from the list is removed too .
after you have selected all images , you can open the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you &apos;ll need to add the addresses and the subject . you have already joined the selected pictures as App@@ endix .
make sure to send many pictures on one time . most E @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for the sending of the images . your configuration is stored and once again used until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you &apos;ll need to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you &apos;ll need to install the GM@@ ail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after selecting the comments in an attached file the comments are added to the images into a text file and add the email .
the PNG format under the menu Image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and not to change the photo quality . otherwise we recommend to JPEG format .
if you choose JPEG format file format and select the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to sen@@ sible pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status messages that you can start automatically at the end . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose you can get this window sch@@ lie ? EN .
after the launch of the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window will be presented with questions like you want to choose your slides . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation are using very elegant images by using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card as otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au is very slow .
this option will show that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left lower corner during the presentation will be displayed .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final pass loop . you can then stop manually with Es@@ c ; then .
the images are random@@ ly select that the images will be displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
under delay between the pictures , the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images are set . 1500 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should test this way before you will show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random from any transition between the images a different effect .
during Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool bar at the upper left screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you .
with this tool bar , you can start the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the di@@ asch@@ au .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background screen is a tool to set a picture as background screen for the working surface .
this module is set up the selected image , depending on the selected option of the base , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
as soon as you have your paintings and videos with remarks , you can see with &amp; k@@ ad album ; by these brow@@ sen , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , in each group , in persons , places and in the group keywords are present .
in the browser window , you can see the categories as you have entered your images and videos with notes . additionally there are entries to view the file structure on your hard drive and of course the current presentation pictures . the following will be described in the following .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you choose a further person , only the pictures are displayed on which both people are visible . by this selection method you can restri@@ ct the number of displayed images of a few thousand pictures on a few individual images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view the images of your site area in order to view the pictures of your site area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can also store with &amp; k@@ ad album ; however , for each person an own label , this is naturally also defined for locations , keywords and other categories you have defined themselves . see the picture .
to view pictures next to the name , select the button , which can be used in the context menu . please note that you can view the view of any category separately . this has the advantage that you can view symbols with pictures of persons and simultaneously a list of key@@ words ( if you don &apos;t have appropriate images for your words ) .
however , you need to set the image for each individual person . you &apos;ll need to view the picture @-@ saf@@ est window ( in closer ) . now you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the saf@@ est window , you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and thus select that part of the image will be displayed or cut off .
when you search the entry in the main window , you will show you a dialog box which is very similar to the dialog for creating the picture characteristics . this dialog can look at the picture once again .
if you want to enter a character string or descriptions of the pictures according to this text , if you want to enter , the date may be either a part of the overall date , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here it is shown to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user guide for &amp; k@@ ad album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to test functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; kiss album ; and look down the quick release , the screen photos and the introductory videos .
start &amp; start @-@ up album ; and select in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ boot album ; for the first time , or choose a menu click on the menu entry . then some sample pictures are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ Audio album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual you will find it on the homepage of &amp; kiss album ; as a associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ est album ; see the timing bar . a picture of this sli@@ der you see here : as the name already says , this surro@@ unds will show you about the images in your database .
the sched@@ ules can display you several different time units . each LEICA shows a different unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by using the LEICA only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the sched@@ ules can be inter@@ viewed on the following ways : you can select the shown preview view from the database ( if you can select a date , the time bar will always display the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate to preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by clicking the mouse button pressed and the mouse over the ruler of the timing bar , so you can choose a range , you &apos;ll be able to preview only pictures of this period . you can pick up the selection by clicking on a beam of the timing bar .
&amp; k@@ ad album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book , the integrated version is described in &amp; k@@ ad album ; integrated version that you can create using the HTML menu .
before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and objective . in the following each section will be more precise .
first , enter the title of the transfer and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ ad album ; HTML @-@ example page , you see an example for this settings .
next , you can choose whether a &amp; c@@ rank@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the over@@ sight page . to find information about export files you will find in .
last@@ ly , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , please note that all pictures of a party are obvious . note that all pictures exported from a party . you can &apos;t use this setting , therefore you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain viewer .
in this section , you can define how the HTML page should look like the HTML page . most influ@@ ential possibilities are unique , which is not specially developed .
below on the page you can view different resolutions for the images . this allows those to consider your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures for example , which have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewing of your site can change the resolution at any time . it can therefore lead your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he want to see a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , insert the different folder and the URL to be stored where your website is stored .
best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the main folder where you will be stored in all your images . this folder will be stored and select at the next time . this folder allows you to select either a folder or one from K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check whether these are really all for viewing . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL that you should be created here should be this folder . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created you are not yet in the final target file , you need to copy them manually . this is not the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the only described options have been related to basic file or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name can set you in the output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images . if you &apos;re already looking for a lot of time , the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to make this work yet once again .
with &amp; collab@@ orative album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can also import other in your database . the image teams are removed with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im @-@ files , internal and external . they distingu@@ ish whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether the images can be stored in the file or whether you can collect all images into the file , and this file can be so independent . the obvious dis@@ advantage is however the file size .
you can choose a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file expor@@ ting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file sear@@ ches the pictures that are not found in the file of .@@ k@@ im file . if the pictures are not found , the pictures of the URL will be searched for creating HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML import .
in the following , the dialog for expor@@ ting pictures describes you to expor@@ ting over the menu file expor@@ ting ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three selection options available :
with the option Manu@@ ally to copy the .@@ k@@ in file , you &apos;ll need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file , copy &amp; k@@ boot album ; the images are automatically set for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it normally doesn &apos;t want to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the option export file .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you don &apos;t send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can say the size limit as you can say that each picture should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the En@@ counter .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ting ... select , will import &amp; k@@ Audio album ; exported database as described in described in .
the assistant to impor@@ ting consists of four steps . first you need to import what pictures you want to import , then in which folder you want to import pictures .
it may be that you are called the category of the category of imported file , while this category is called for your database people . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be imported into the third dialog window , which are to be imported into your database .
in the fourth step , you can choose the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . one example will see you on the picture .
it must be easy to browse images and look at : if you see pictures you want to view images often within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to view images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your boy@@ friend you would like to see all images , on which this friend see is shown .
in this manual you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) to put the information on your pictures , above ( 2 ) to search and see , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ ting possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today also car@@ es your videos . at many places in this manual will have spoken about pictures , but often it also closes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ ad album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy to a dis@@ kette or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S .
&amp; k@@ ad album ; indicated the folder where your paintings are stored and use this with future Star@@ ts . if you want to start another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ boot album ; using option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ finished album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings for your album ; you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ boot album ; modify the different setup possibilities to be explained in the following section of the user book .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can contact the preview possibilities of preview and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you how you can define various features such as people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog box which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box options you can submit complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in .
you can see the setup possibilities to provide you to the list of membership groups . you can select the category . in the left window , you can select a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ iller Album ; share his modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ plug and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface . can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ ready album ; but most of the modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules of multiple applications can be used together , it can test that the modules have tested with &amp; c@@ rank@@ album ; therefore you should try to call new modules at first time with the command &gt; k@@ eling album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I don &apos;t have to war@@ ned it !
the applications that use modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible to work some modules with &amp; c@@ rank@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with different applications .
the greatest difference between &amp; k@@ est album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply plug@@ ged in albums : this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ates the order for some modules the order to albums that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ boot album ;
simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ ful album ; the current album , which is easy to see the current view , so all the images that shows you the picture show .
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ iller album ; the modules can also be handed over to a list of albums . here , the current album will be presented here :
if &amp; kiss album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category as category for virtual albums , used as a category for virtual albums . if so , if you are using the category for example , if you are selected , if you have selected people to view and pass this module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ ad album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the range modules that modules can be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen once you can start &amp; kiss album ; start your own pictures .
as you &apos;ve been used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can see your picture database . currently , we don &apos;t have any information about your pictures . in the section we will be back on this window , then click on the record images that shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ ad album ; is the possibility to see each picture with notes . this includes information about the people who set up on the picture . you can set each picture either by either or for a larger number of images specific remarks . if you have shown on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen were taken .
all of these comments may be used for searching and browser , as you can read in the section . if you want to see this comments if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by using persons , places and pass@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ ready album ; since you will always use it again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is the shift of the pictures based on the list : if you are shown for example a family party and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be moved , so that the names are moved to above , which can find people faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to view an ill@@ iter@@ ated list , click on the symbol for sor@@ ting to date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture , you might want to edit any selected pictures and have this picture with remarks . click in this case simply click on the right and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture above .
if you have several pictures , for example using the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark this images and use the menu item added to one note once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all available in the USA . Moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a special rate is displayed .
in context menu of the announ@@ cements di@@ alog@@ s it is possible to add one entry to a existing or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also take one entry to a category and place there to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you are just ill@@ iter@@ ate your categories in alphabetical order .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the memory di@@ alog@@ s by clicking the edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a private window by using it out of the window section .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , click on the button options ... , which gives you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also read a frame with a frame . if you want to view this window later , use the button options ... and then window a / aus@@ ed . this process will see you in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview with screen@@ shots of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you have no filters . you can configure the size of your mouse , by simple to bottom of mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy .
if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as background picture for your desktop .
when you click on a picture , this image will be displayed in the picture . if you have no window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures from the image . simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select either in menu Edit menu . now you can view the window which you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ ad album ; you can also use this problem to have a solution . you can also use the pictures , without you have stored on the hard disk . of course , you have to store the pictures somewhere on the hard disk . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ Audio album ; if not all the images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not on the hard disk . this is , e.g. at the pictures 1 @-@ 9 , however , this is not visible on the hard disk . this is the preview of this pictures . however , you can also view this picture with the picture viewer .
as you can see this function you need to copy files from the folders and then copy them again . if you want to avoid the setup of the relevant CD . if you want to avoid how the passage to your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all pictures on it .
in the menu pictures you would like to have a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay some more privacy , see the pictures so that you can see for other un@@ accessible menu . alternatively , you can also see all images that may see your little sister , to control and select the menu item everything except for current view .
to make sure that images are hidden in the case of the fish . if you have to lock the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry , allowing all the images that you want to be locked . if you want to view the images again , click Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered for un@@ lock the pictures . to set this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection should not be sure . you can read all images on the hard drive and to the other one can read out the password as un@@ turn@@ key text or delete . this kind of password protection serves only to make those who are talking with &amp; k@@ eling album ; not very familiar with a view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to describe all your images with &amp; k@@ est album ; manage and hours about hours to describe it is of course you want to consider it sometime . from this reason , you can view it sometime . from this reason , you can view it out of the preview as described in , as described in .
you can see the viewer . it shows the picture , but additional all the information that you have to enter on the picture , such as who is on the picture when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the top part of the image you want to see , then you can configure these easily with the mouse and what information can be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . then you can see the text menu .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and back , by using the buttons picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded on the viewer , you can run it as a slide show . and then you can press a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can be controlled by the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or Min@@ us . the slide is stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s deleted album ; is it possible to change in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer , you can check out into the picture in the image . you can get off the mouse button with the mouse button you can get back down the Plus key into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn . with the equ@@ ations of the zo@@ oms , each pixel on the screen is equal to a pixels of the image .
note that the only zoom oper@@ ations will work in videos that are in and out out with the Plus@@ - and min@@ ust@@ om .
with the shooting functions from the context menu you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make remarks on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you consider images , you can find a picture with a person whose name can be open on the picture . at the moment , you can open the image and configuration dialog of the image to mark this name . however , it might be able to mark the picture and consider further images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper . to see what photos you want to start to see the viewer with the pictures and look at it as good or bad , while you see one after the others .
for the two examples above gives you the possibility to view pictures with traits , while you can view it . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the appropriate letters . in order to see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have respect to your pictures , you can see this in browser . if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected pictures to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the pre@@ view screen . if you can view categories in D@@ re pre@@ view , then you can view features to the pictures by simply select the letters for the feature , after the picture was selected here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to paint &amp; kiss album ; on the picture .
the ground is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can &apos;t make your common later .
in case you can see a picture on the screen . in order to place the painting mode of &amp; k@@ boot album ; select the painting from the context menu . to end the m@@ alen press the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully covered , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then the properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire models yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the object of a already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are possible positions , the following hing@@ ed menu will be built , so that you can choose the right position :
with delete either from the menu bar under Be@@ ing or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click on user to take these changes . if you are inv@@ alid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can click the input error and then click on users or retri@@ eve the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog box , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of your own view .
press a preview in Fe@@ el &apos;s own view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the selected texture . if you want to select one of the texture ( for example a texture in a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of camera .
if a transformation is chosen , marks the control points and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by pulling using the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Vis@@ i@@ bility level . you can specify this value relative to the visible object or as absolute value . objects will be displayed only when they are selected or its vision level of small or equal to the scene of the scene is selected .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views are shown on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it as desired . you can also store multiple windows and easily change between different arrangements .
to sign a window over or under a view , draw the shape to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , draw the facade to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this screen and extends over the overall height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the vision in the middle to another view . you can then switch between the views on the map of the map in the views above .
the last possible shut@@ ters are en@@ woven views : views that are not in the main window are an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . in order to solve a view from the thick@@ ening to the desktop or click on the little arrows at the top left of the display bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the summary bar . to prevent the closing machine , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu View you can find entries for any type of views . new views are dirty , you can in@@ lay them in any place .
the current windows view can save you with view window order ... save . it is shown a dialog where you can store window order under an existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ ders , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ders the current scene , click the Symbol Ren@@ ders icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view .
one R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ ders . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can attach any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full images in the highest quality .
if you click the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View View@@ ing modes ... select the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can only enter any name , but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the cart@@ el map size you can select the width and height of the rounded image . if you want only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and give the image section to the ren@@ ders into the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the features that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it is used by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the table properties can be found in the us@@ and@@ buch &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a painting with only one beam per pixel you can create different errors . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è patterns or stud effects in curves and lines , and sometimes more details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general , pictures are better seen with this feature .
if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is getting further split and adap@@ tive because the records of the calculated colour values depend on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray has a beam of pixels , then both pixels are processed by the persecution of a particular additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each . if the difference is shared between the colour values , then the pixels will be split into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be evaluated individually and further evaluated on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is reducing the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light refle@@ ct@@ ance . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this card card you can adjust if the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file impor@@ ting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is not supported the full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when impor@@ ting the error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window shows a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; please write these sources between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ ning and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end .
you can move objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this is the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . select objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and draw him in the object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor , you can also insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is a scene . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the company &apos;s own view , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler opens &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches after external files ( for example , al@@ mond code ) into the arrows to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you are deleted files , you &apos;ll also need to put the path to these files here . if a file is present in different paths of library , the first folded file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the colour for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type identification .
you can set the slides of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you cross high quality assurance for extended proj@@ ections , all proj@@ ections are using a expanded projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross wall display , a wall is behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess boards pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you cross the bottom , there is a floor below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess boards pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you activate edge det@@ ach@@ ment method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for the ren@@ ders of the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling value can be set . more precisely information on parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can modify the existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders will be explained , as you can save windows and save .
the combination field standard window Regulations : shows all existing windows . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order to the start of the program .
the list of the shut@@ ters shows all existing windows . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can add to the button and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with in@@ quiries you will get the window under the existing window , with cart@@ oning card , you will not get the view on the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to follow without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all the steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate scene easy to create , under beginnings : a ball on a plane .
but you should make the following warning carefully , before you compl@@ ain about it , before you get a result of a black screen . if you use a 3D program to the first time you should see these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set the camera , no rules can be applied for the Ren@@ ders , as a result you will get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert a light sources , your entire scene in the dark and you will only receive a black image .
if you have installed everything you have installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ set window rules :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation that you can get an appropriate presentation what you can expect from this program .
you will now use these menus and symbols now , therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . therefore you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene to create . in particular , note the scene from the fourth wire model ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the outcome of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click to view the contents of the view object properties , where the different parameters of the camera will be found in the user documentation &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find further details .
change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but you can change the camera in the view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and draw him to the desired place .
if you press the button user or the input field , change the wire model views and the object @-@ tree immediately accordingly to these settings . as a result , they look at the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you might set a quant@@ ader ( insert and insert the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a permanent method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; offers a sim@@ pler option . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or the input paste . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire model view is now also the plane when even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
when you can view the object tree , you will find that you can find the entry for the ground . in this case you will find the different parameters of object . in this case you will find only the options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to know some of these parameters . select shi@@ fting and set the values as follows :
just select the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit .
in both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select how the object is added to the object . please choose the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pigments shows a mat black material because you need to check out the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . give now the colors for the pigment . also , there are many possibilities now , but do you now take the easiest ways .
if you don &apos;t see in the preview no colour on Qu@@ ader and ball , click the button user and call the preview .
the material for the floor is right now . if you want your image now with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the colour display . you need to enter two new attributes . in the colour list you need to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this entry , but the play@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should you easily run , as you have already understood the basic work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be just as simple as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can change the settings . use the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to push the input or the button user ) , that the ball should be bo@@ iled with the ground . otherwise you would have moved the ground around a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ ders now gives a sel@@ f@@ ames result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a mat black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now choose a material now . as in the ground , enter the ball a pigment as color :
first , select initial object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , select then insert and set the values as follows :
but you can reach interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on user or press the procedure .
the settings of brightness and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal is not selected :
you should now have a good impression of it , which offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; hop@@ efully , you have already learned how much you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er , the rendering is reflected in the scene of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflect the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene and how the atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene is reflected and how atmospheric effects can work like the m@@ ist . so the scene is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera that you can see the scene . without a light source , you can also see anything , the picture is simple black . obviously , any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you can open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you have to enter a name and a disk space .
represents the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
this menu entry allows you only to select if you do not have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last reverse order command . this menu entry allows you only to select if you have used to use .
stores the current windows rules and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the appearance , the key@@ chains and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the scanning process . you can change with this option pre@@ fix for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; -@@ commands or new .
opens a dialog for setting up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove this option tool bar for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; -@@ commands and remove .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a possibility to avoid rough surfaces without any hi@@ ves on the surface , and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric forms that can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models will then be processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object colour to pixels , by application of a image file as color card .
&amp; ku@@ k show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application features a file browser that you can select images to the display .

the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly seen in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP function break could look &amp; z@@ b ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command lines .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use your dialog where the user doesn &apos;t run , why a script is not running .

in this folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts , or simply expand your functions as the basis for your own scripts . you will quickly notice that the writing of scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can share your scripts with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be@@ ating every K@@ DE installation .
most scripts languages allow the output of external programmes and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here an example in Python :
&amp; n@@ arok ; sends noti@@ fications to all the scripts . for this reason , scripts are attemp@@ ting to monitor its default setting and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events even if there is no use .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . in order to take care and loading of the setup data must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok put the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alized that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume Sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ised Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : Sub@@ menu title , Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item can also be identified . to remove the script the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script , the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script , e@@ Custom@@ p am@@ arok script , e@@ Custom@@ men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu Title ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok ; termin@@ ate , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script administration can also install script packages that have downloaded the user &amp; z@@ b ; such packages are also compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , that the user can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; n@@ arok ; 1.3 only accept script packages with the extension of amar@@ isk script . for this reason , you should select your script packages equal right .
the main cre@@ pt must be detailed ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be detailed . use the T@@ sar parameters -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and put the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; am@@ arok ; attached to your entry to k@@ de apps you should use the categ@@ orie ; script .

am@@ aro@@ K needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs contained , for &amp; am@@ arok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide as we compiled K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD , that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org and also hang the capac@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . then you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ lib in reading the Meta information from this file crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you are using MySQL as a database then try again SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ arok ; is a bit mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ arok ; used libraries with the same compiler version compiled . if e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when editing the Meta information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate autom@@ . if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ side by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is an frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ drop , the error is guaranteed .
this is that many program can write data as UTF @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ information , but this does not describe it as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

this script requires the Perl module for MP3 : M@@ pli@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : mice &apos;
&amp; n@@ arok ; s symbols are still active in the status bar ( random smo@@ dus / repet@@ ition / dynamic re @-@ track ) . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click the status disabled on grey and semi transparent . please note that in some cases you must click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : im@@ aging symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Ch@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;@@ _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K can be found first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems clari@@ fy themselves at the lightest by the help of a experts of your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Canal # am@@ arok .

after the start of &amp; n@@ arok ; it appears only a blank playlist . how are now music pieces come in ?
that is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the Start -@@ Unter@@ window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are possible for the review by the user while the points will be automatically charged .
to rate the pieces of the playlist , you need to display the text box in the playlist and select the column . click somewhere in the new evaluation box . click here . you can also use the short fault Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
choose the files you want to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist menu .
draw a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would like to make it with other files . so easy : - )
in the tool bar of the playlist , directly next to the Add button , you will find the button playlist . click here .
presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ arok ; new . look again after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .

when you use the g@@ amer driver with Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer . a mixer allows for several applications to use the device to the same time . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix @-@ module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . look at the Help D@@ Mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem of problem and a solution . for g@@ amer you need to specify a different s@@ ink ( e.g. cam@@ sink ) .
this is doing &amp; am@@ arok ; don &apos;t forget that media is first de@@ coded . you can only look for most people the best choice if you read a dec@@ or with little overhead . g@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .

M@@ ad : here it is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio @-@ layer layer I , layer II , and layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : an free Open Source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read FLA@@ C files .
dra@@ gon@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for the processing of various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to un@@ lock them on a audio CD .
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X is used by SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped car system for processing , dis@@ assem@@ bler and analyze video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is easy to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . that can be useful for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording seal of the various albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that will be different according to the music .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : here it is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically can play all videos in the basic folder of CD .
this is a comfortable method , recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on one entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has already been saved once , the previously created file will be asked after a new file name .
stores the current project under a new file names . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialogue Save under is displayed , using the folder and file name for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file .
closes the current project . if a project changes and still not stored , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what it should happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . Moreover , you can also break the closing and open the project .
closes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project , what should be done so as you would have called for any project file .
closes all the open projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project is asked what it should happen , as if you were called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so @-@ added files appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burning the media dialog can only open when the project is already included .
opens the characteristics dialog for the current project . here you can book many proj@@ ec@@ zo@@ ic settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is this ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only in a active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you don &apos;t use files for a multi@@ session CD . this is not used when this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files using existing files and folders .
this entry appears only in a active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function will be removed from the current project . all other files will remain in the project . this function remov@@ es no files from the medium , it is only the previously imported files .
opens the CD copying dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD which you can then burn sometime later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copying dialog . this allows you to create copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also need to burn a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue , therefore , the target medium has to be big enough to record the entire ( vide@@ ot@@ ape ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for Del@@ ete a CD @-@ RW . so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format which makes it completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes and incre@@ mental .
bur@@ ns a CD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source which then can immediately be burned by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported but you must use other tools such as No.1 g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source which then can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will typically be used . this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the syn@@ onymous video , but can also be used for information about the le@@ ased video , body settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . these information is shown in the syn@@ onymous view and include the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small strip on the lower edge of the window is indicated . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is low .
the folder view is an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media information , sper@@ ren and un@@ lock the drive or out of the media .
the content view is a or of . the content view allows you to select and pulling files into the projection view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in folder view .
the head@@ lamp in the projection view is a nar@@ rower area that is only visible when the projection is open to open projects . the head has no real function , it looks pretty beautiful and separates the projection vision clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to changing the keyboard orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adapt the keyboard order to below .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are needed , therefore you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can work general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ h@@ ie@@ b . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shopping script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or that a little more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , so it is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which allows you to give .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ ins ; program uses &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and additional functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ interactive Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ ario Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) , cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) , cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) , cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) , cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) , bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) , bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b provides the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface , which is applicable only on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
mil@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) , cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) , add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) , In@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Quartet , Q@@ string new@@ name ) , set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String Quartet )
so it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der , d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT li@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is a audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( compressed ) is supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( compression free compression ) . currently , l@@ ame pack@@ ets must be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD , read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia used . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , so it is not necessary to comp@@ ile any thing for any Linux distri@@ butions . but if using FLA@@ C , the installation is not needed , whose installation is not needed .
the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ aser / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this program is not possible to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to get any protected audio CD ; even does not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . just avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier@@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once it must be done ( the setup dialog can be called as often as a suitable configuration ) , it will follow the daily use of a &amp; CD ; which leads to the hard drive for the slim approach of the user interface , which you are often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which co@@ sting programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can get &amp; CD : information from fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of commands of the main race . on the page step by step example you will find further information such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the program .
the CD@@ DB request of the CD data is based on request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case , first of the connection to the Internet . )
starts out and - when a Encoder has been configured in tab for coding settings .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default . it is to be aware that before Encoder has been configured in tab .
opens the file manager so that one has already been selected to en@@ code a complete &amp; CD instead of a complete &amp; CD .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming ( as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main introductory dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with different cart@@ oning cards ( such as Encoder , to setup the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ sting and compression rates and helps you to choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are other similar to &apos; hormone &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices to play these files .
among the audio formats , information about data comp@@ ress according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG can now have a light advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is yet free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high @-@ quality sound quality ( for high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG easily deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are available .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of music
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for stereo stereo audio systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs more than 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good com@@ ug to music by adolescents , portable devices and Aut@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ irs . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you have absolutely the absolutely highest quality , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that can be entered manually or by the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there are often a combination of program settings for Ko@@ di@@ ers and these parameters . the manual or aid to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s shall be encoded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ d@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter must be added by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator . the result looks as follows : &apos; ...
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters which can be used ( = button designation in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , where you can download the audio CDs , so that all other information can download itself into the computer . it is to note that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ bot is not lawyer . however , nobody can prevent the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so it cannot be added to the artist nor the music company . all information can be used in a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; it is active a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems to be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address when using the server is not used ( This may only know the programmer to know the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the geographical zone is to be used on the next lying mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org provides a current list of mirror ser@@ ver@@ n for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; more information can be downloaded during a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates database .
what is the reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
it is rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to know in source code .... This was always the best choice for the read of audio CD ; s. to observe that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first if this is not yet done .
for saving the WAV files , the co@@ di@@ ers can be selected for the desired file format . in the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less comp@@ ressing for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . further information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device number of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a hint on what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want an copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the case of the &amp; CD ; this will not be yellow !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this may be as tips to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , but they are somehow un@@ sure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not fully free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files that you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy it with the cross @-@ section ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something is probably done only once and
the second section describes the presentation of a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for every application &amp; CD ; repe@@ ats to be repeated .
here we determine the encoding of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with you to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
even though we can change this settings at any time , we will not be able to change any &amp; CD at any time , if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reader program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
frequently is / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device designation of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is also available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to use there existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the cart@@ oning card General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be loaded / entered as shown in screen photo .
only in case of incomplete information , you will be informed if information is missing to the words of keywords ( tags ) .
the disk card CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet , so that he can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you &apos;re not satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can be changed slightly . the directory or file name will be changed with Con@@ qu@@ order - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
in addition to this example , if you want to enter all manually , then de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b mode , if you want to use the database before . however , this is worth about 620 MB , if you want to use the database . however , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first box in the mode is set up on the following board card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are the settings for the data request , for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server about the internet . how is the system that will get the CD ? read the section via fre@@ ed@@ b . set out the section via fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and look after a mirror server in your proximity . on this road the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as first attempt .
both works equal to the server , as many Fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 standards , there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to translate any &amp; CD ; data on the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure that the folder / tmp is installed on your computer )
number of permanent pieces simultaneously : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one drive at only one existing drive ? parallel reading and codi@@ le ? the author knows not so easy to try .
CD ; after reading the last denom@@ inations : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
custom file for temporary files : if you cross this sign , then the path / folders can be saved in which the WAV files can be stored in which the WAV files are created , the files will not be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
all then enter as it &apos;s on screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances must be b@@ aked anything after the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . this achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the command &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of creation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted on demand . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags : % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the input ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
use the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of simultaneously to encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each instructor of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change them again .
in this section it is described , as the process of reading &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is organized , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; the process of the fre@@ ed@@ b is described , and the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for every application &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we have a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , see the screen photos a bit different than that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully from fre@@ ed@@ b re@@ produced data . therefore , you will learn how to get data manually from the Internet . comments on the differences may refer to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; it could be identified and identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then seek questions and answers after help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been collected successfully from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles of the pieces have already been filled and additionally displayed the name of the artist and the album .
for the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window embedded , and you can select the database entry , your opinion is best to your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t have chosen the check box for the automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ) , you can also manually redeem this manually by selecting the first buttons in tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , but you will need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ers per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments using all the tracks of the CD .
attention : after the successful check of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to review the contents of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors , so that you do not only begin with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with big letter or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator . this option is set up at the tab card Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er@@ settings ; take a look at the tab &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . check in the help to help you obtain more information .
simply select one entry , which is obviously true with the style of express CD . this example is not important because we do not have the &amp; CD ; -@@ dates so why go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are available under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors will be back and you see that the fields for the album is already completed with the entered data . simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure on the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window appears not if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the item list .
note that there is a check characters in front of each line . just the titles are selected . a simple click on the line will select that all the pieces are selected , or select the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at one time .
was launched by clicking on the button selection process , so this window appears to be confirmation . click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and follow the end .
click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
these trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting see if you are trying to work with a body that you are not installed yet . pieces that are not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered in this example . have you checked if you have access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . so you can read and codi@@ le in parallel . please note the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to read this behaviour , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems no problem when simultaneously read and codi@@ fied ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded , and a third order in the maintenance @-@ long of the body is encoded . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will be attached with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ 5mm or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you will need the coefficient of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you do not have a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is already done . if you &apos;re reading this , you have already done it ...
this section is set to persons compiled by source files and do not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for using how the program can be adjusted to your needs , then it is the following right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best . read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different boxes of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always on reading right ? even if only the help menu was clicked on the right @-@ time starting point ( especially when it is on the time of the program , no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
why is it ? who reads that already has already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot add this manual for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; who can also want to do something for a hand@@ book with the author . and if you &apos;re reading this section , he has given this section and is therefore agree with this proposal .
strange when we managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ es@@ Player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others he has not have a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke real collection of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player did not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD is running on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supported the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included when it supports a sequ@@ encing .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI Channel through highlighted keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can get in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to spro@@ ut .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( son@@ g@@ ings or text boxes ) . K@@ Mid determines automatically the procedure .
seat support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; at the end of a Lie@@ utenant , K@@ Mid will start again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P @-@ driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . the usual file dialog appears , which allows you to select the desired song .
you can also have a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will also work with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a music piece , open and beg@@ at the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry card from the menu piece or set the Le@@ ert@@ z menu .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you go on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played before each other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece you can jump in any place by using the middle of mouse button and drive along the knob .
if you find that a song can be played quickly or slowly , you can change to the left and right of the speed display and then change the play@@ speed . to get back the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if one piece is played , a pressure on the button pause or select the menu entry in the menu piece , so it breaks off . enter the le@@ vers while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; reproduction .
Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis , other use li@@ ed@@ t@@ anning and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events will be determined automatically , and even better : the event type will be used automatically , so that you need nothing to manually set the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a event type , select from the menu settings the entries text characters or lesson . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are played by the series as well as you can use collections .
to win a collection , first open the collection manager . this will find in the menu collection under the Point Organ@@ s .... click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the required quantity required in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , she must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to add a song . it appears again the file @-@ dialog box , which allows you to select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic add to the collection .
if automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will be added automatically to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a product the temporary collection is activated and gel@@ e@@ ert . this collection will then be added to the opening pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on Remove .
you can select the order where the songs can be played in the menu . if you choose the row after the menu of the menu , the songs are played in the sequence as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove a random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the button on the right .
to jump a song to jump a song , select the button fore@@ most , the entry previous piece of the menu or press the button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , the temporary collection doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is necessarily necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always wanted to play a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only a sound card , you don &apos;t need any MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible with GM ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . you need to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite picture ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all required circumstances for playing one piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section which may appear as often as desired . for this , however , every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; another key@@ map ... EN@@ D @-@ CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
they see that it is needed to display that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
this section is specified as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign is igno@@ red . it is believed that the GM patches are available in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds which supports this instrument to use the number M ( GM Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which is similar to a def@@ ensive ring . then apply the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
if now , a score of MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( def@@ ensive ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone in the MIDI file is .
please note that here with the term Drum patch the patch is meant , when each sound is a different per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , tank , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , in which the tone gives the sound level of the same drum ( as some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify like tones on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section is the order of lines very important , as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can use multiple Ke@@ ym@@ aps for each channel and each instrument to use multiple Ke@@ ym@@ aps . you only need to use different names in the first row .
Ke@@ ym@@ aps are mainly used to form sounds on the per@@ cus@@ sions channel . check out as an example the provided cone aps .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to exchange some channels for the first and second channel , make it easy to use in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is used on the channel N . if you are using the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be defined further in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will ignore all events that will change the patch on this channel . in this case the patch is always used Patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ cus@@ sions patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio should be multiplied , in which proportion of pitch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file is converted to the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) is converted and then continue until the value 4096 is used to do so in the Map file no dec@@ imal kom@@ mas .
this setting is used because GM gives you a keyboard , which receives a Pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 4096 , a sound higher . unfortunately , but try to play some keyboards up to one octave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog for MIDI settings . you can find in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of cl@@ avi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel screen to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have changed a tool . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played tones . view from the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the pace LCD displays the speed which is played with a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a couch . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it has to be played like a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , and etc . so that the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices , just like two different musicians the same notes can play in very different ways .
well , I can convert z@@ em@@ ary , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs you to change a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over all .
this can happen if you have a binary ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source of exchange and install ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
agreed , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , activate the automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD double .
I have a &amp; cross @-@ cross ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window change and select the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file , if you want to add a file to a collection , switch the setting automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you want to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. you only want to play the first file . so , you can open the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains just this a MIDI file .
then join us to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs , listen to the postcard , continue to program &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) , I &apos;m not much time for my hobby , but I try to show me a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I try to collect MIDI files , music and phr@@ ases .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it runs as if you have a sound card , except you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; ma@@ iling lists or send an error message directly to me .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window , which will only be displayed if information .
it is possible to select the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which should be played after each other , you should use the category continuous playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ archy , the group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous playback box can also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration file . of course you can choose the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps , and then you can choose from the menu . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML contents will appear this part .
after changing XML files , must be selected from the menu same with playlist , or select either the processing mode or another category .
all changes lost when processing mode or another group selected will be selected with the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at starting and can be de@@ activated by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ player err@@ c and Change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation when starting does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be inter@@ rupt at the end @-@ animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; lt ; lt ; IM@@ G procedure = &quot; Me@@ et &quot; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / h ; / h ; / / / / h ; samples are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the intermediate size of the disk volume from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player clearly .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ player , such as a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec Mozilla .
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can even be played the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player module must be used as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog box of K@@ DE .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be used in a console application and after error messages concerning the load of the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ player err@@ c . for example , phon@@ i should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; c@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards either by using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be downloaded , the scanner is used to use manual and TV channels can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data Rek@@ order ) Settings in the settings of the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , of which one must be selected ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name has probably included a DVB .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video can also work ( probably this type of play@@ off of video devices under Linux is the only the only function ) . this is also necessary to use the Video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server . therefore , it must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ source , source source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if it is activated , they start playing with the playback of the playlist .
are there how to make my CD@@ ROM drive silent when I play from him ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root according to the mount of the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure / dev / c@@ eva is based on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine will only start slowly but why the CPU has to be tested on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will examine x@@ ine the CPU .

the same as other design languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction to the text format such as paper format , side number@@ ing and text gr@@ ates with the text . the introduction should be closed with the command \ \ Works class , the Cologne command , and must be closed with the command \ \ \ { Premature Ejaculation } .
the quick entry @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a good function for the rapid preparation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . it can also be done some on the document @-@ related settings .
document classes : hereby , the type of the document is used : articles ( article &#93; , letter &#91; custom &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : hereby , the coding of the system will be used . modern systems use UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . best , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most used supplem@@ entary packages for &amp; lat@@ ex . for the integration they are only balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Review ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ entation of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( on compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the German text in the creation of German text .
new users can &apos;t worry no concerns . it is just a short description of the functions and further information are given in the section .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , att@@ itudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . if it is not closed on the screen , it is believed that some mathematical environment has not be closed . however , it is still possible through the modest appearance of the output . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and saving .
with the automatic adjustment of environments ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically creates a idle line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line to the command of the command ( e.g. \ \ by { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are normally divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; ex@@ h@@ ort the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ merged element ) :
during the view of the document , the individual elements can be changed by a mouse click on the respective and viewed .
in the creation of your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ mination file ( English D e V ice I n@@ ay File ) &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; through one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information like the font art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex . there are many tools to view , conversion and print from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and rooms .
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ Ã ¤ ts@@ r@@ hin@@ ts , the elements of the DVI ; file is clicked on the button in the DVI ; -@@ file is clicked on the exact opposite section in the &amp; lat@@ ex . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is clicked on the appropriate site in the DVI ; viewer can be spec@@ kl@@ ed .
Master document : this function is used when working with several files . with a master document the work is simplified using other in@@ bound .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document can be set to project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no error occurs in the source code ) .
file extension : in this mode the DVI ; file is mounted on the b@@ der@@ un@@ gen@@ ic road . and it &apos;s not a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
in consideration of the work tool bar , the three large areas of the selection process should be developed for the rapid integration of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The for@@ g@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection field further is available for articles such as keywords , joints , notes or references .
name : with this command , a name for a section is created , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified designation ( selection of a selection box ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list with literary entries will be displayed . in &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are relevant editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ b@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files are very good as well in &amp; cr@@ ile ; the author are also written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ is used for the setting of the font , which are set up for the main text , the Fu@@ Ã ¨ Music etc . there are the following font names :
on the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection options are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fixed the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason to hand on the hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ Document class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font , and the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be taken in text .
once the above source text example has to be compiled in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the easiest way to be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the building or the button .
the source code must be stored in front of the compilation . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing the storage is automatically generated .
the compilation of the document command should be searched for errors after the errors . when used by quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
an area ( English ) is a text that is described differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the text area should be created , \ \ &apos; and \ \ by { environment } , \ \ &apos; s and \ \ by { environment } . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ig@@ â &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be taken in the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the changes only will be super@@ vised within the surrounding area ( by \ \ \ in { environment } to \ \ by { environment } ) . there is no dec@@ eption ( number ) for the changes within a environment .
there are many opportunities for the reading and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . can be used either by the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the surrounding area .
\ \ Beg@@ in { em@@ ph } : this command is available for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a \ \ end { em@@ ph } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ em@@ ph { Word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ by { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background of the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; label language , this is now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; c@@ ile .
once in the assistant was entered into a bit text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . if you need a quote , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , can be returned to the editor by editor or Str@@ g E ( on the internal viewing ) . when an external viewer must be closed .
once the DVI ; file created , the document is printed or in a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is a silent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ º ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .@@ d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ um@@ converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as required for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) .
the tool@@ bar ap@@ ort the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the conversion can start converting any other formats using the buttons in the tool bar .
the predi@@ ction of the direct jump from the editor to the right position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . this must only be Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools Building adult .
in order to execute the advance search , the mouse poin@@ ter should be positioned in one line of the source code and can be clicked on the right side . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer is then made .
this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece is made with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document lin@@ king &amp; accessories ; as text editor are set to set up as text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should the use of quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer is not possible , can be an error . if an error occurred , this is displayed in the protocol file or in the message window .
the protocol file uses the error source in the source code . the protocol file is always used in the error . the protocol file is always used to consider the faul@@ ty line , must be clicked on the error in the protocol , navig@@ ating to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the appropriate button in the tool bar , a window appears to choose from the available template for the document . the default setting are :
with selection of empty document a document can be used either by reason to re@@ written or the assistant to create a new document . further information are included in the section .
H@@ Ã ¤ u@@ alized user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates are created , stored and re@@ loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or create a new file created by using an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template by a file , some string labels will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing coding ) . these variables are set up in settings ... settings are set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know what character strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in documentation class . typically , it is used to be used : \ \ Short class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { 5 &#93; } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the Assist@@ ants and the associated entry into the editor . as soon as the document has been created following this way :
when creating a new document , then the own template can be used instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created . if a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps of described above described above .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmer with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made directly in the menu .
around more than &amp; Kate ; and to learn about Kate , the hand@@ book should be found to Kate . users of &amp; c@@ ile , can be found there directly with the reading of the book by &amp; Kate .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command line , which can be called for the menu of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; can be used as well as their syntax .
double double @-@ click Rhin@@ g button to avoid the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way clicking on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ certified ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with twi@@ sted left mouse button , the balanced text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with ge@@ ared change@@ over , you can create parts of the source text in the editors window .
&amp; c@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the various kinds of sources as well as these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another colour .
a lot of assist@@ ants are harvest@@ ing . this is a private type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu will be highlighted the jump to the n@@ most or last dive stamp . this trampoline is highlighted so that they will automatically eng@@ age in the first input of a character .
this work is probably one of the most important asp@@ ir@@ ations in using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; excellent functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; excellent functions for their selection . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under work@@ around the following commands are included in the text code :
do not contain a complete sub@@ section ( group of lines that include on both sides a blank line ( like in other text ratings ) . this extended meaning has not been added to tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of source code . the only clear thing is in &amp; cr@@ ile ; it is that the par@@ cel are separated by two empty lines .
the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also has an extended meaning since this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a rich star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for reading a part of the document , nat@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ens can be removed . &amp; Kate ; offers the key element C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands for a faster result . below are the following commands for reading the text :
remov@@ es a complete sub@@ section . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; cr@@ ile ; is included in the description to do working environments .
it was already clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; c@@ ile ; for further prec@@ epts under work@@ around environment for a m@@ ight@@ ful work with &amp; lat@@ ex .
this command will spec@@ kl@@ ed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the order .
this command will spec@@ kl@@ ed at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , the end of the surrounding area is spec@@ kl@@ ed ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering a lot of welded environment command can be lost rapidly . this command should be lost the last environment , so that the common environment structure is not tender .
&amp; c@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Be@@ work Te@@ X Group are a few important commands that correspond to the environment .
this command will be spec@@ kl@@ ed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the enclosed cl@@ amps .
this command will be spec@@ kl@@ ed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closed mon@@ ammer .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the shred@@ ded cl@@ as@@ sign of a &amp; tex ; Group # is to be spec@@ kl@@ ed at the other end of the group ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering a lot of welded groups , groups can be lost quickly . this command should be lost the last modified group , so that the mer@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not tender .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy beginnings as a track sign is used in &amp; c@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two easy beginnings of the beginnings is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case , and for two additional beg@@ ining signs for &amp; lat@@ ex .
this automatic insert for double initial sign can be set under the settings ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be switched off .
it also uses the specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ym@@ ns or French ) and with the German or French beginnings . there are also many other languages available .
when Dr@@ inks of Shift ; Regist@@ ered &amp; c@@ ile ; an intelligent Z@@ eil@@ en@@ um@@ eration . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , just a tick control but also the command \ \ item .
close within a tables environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; .
even better - &amp; c@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be used under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be used .
some users can arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) ; seeks to ex@@ chan@@ ted each other . although this Tab@@ ulator will not be used in the dar@@ ling line . although this table is not necessary , for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already offering a good source code , this in &amp; c@@ ile ; it has been added to the automatic commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three according to demand and the other two are available . all these modes are working under Settings ... all these modes can be adjusted under the settings ... all these modes are set .
when you start a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically stops the command \ \ by { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the R@@ Ã ¼ inch button , the last letter of input will be removed and makes it possible , the list can also be sc@@ aled down by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , nat@@ Ã ¼ n@@ ants are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , a jump to these positions can be adjusted to these positions by work@@ marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est dive brand , and the intended parameters then be frozen .
using settings ; in@@ trin@@ sic path@@ ogenic settings for these lists . there are different knowledge lists for &amp; tex ; - &amp; &amp; lat@@ ex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as knowledge of the general language use .
the command mode is suitable for installation environments . it is always entered into a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the fully automatic mode will be used . on the other hand , the environments will be used as often as often , the environments will be used as often used to simpli@@ fy the environments of the environments .
when the call of the fully operational environment or the key Alt + Shift button , the command is automatically folded for the surrounding area , and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . after this , the ambient temperature can be continued , and it may be terminated by pressing the input .
after this is completed , the surrounding area will be closed automatically . once again , recogni@@ zes that it is a lists environment , it is even a first \ \ item command .
using settings ; in@@ ile ... cr@@ ile ; used settings to these lists . this mode uses the serial list of the processing mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; c@@ ile ; defined custom lists of ab@@ brevi@@ ations , which can be replaced immediately by l@@ Ã ¼ n@@ ere strings . as an example of a copy list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is used , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word in@@ compreh@@ en@@ ation mode is entered into the menu of processing or the key r@@ zel + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large buildings are not helpful for automatic shut@@ ters . however , it was noted that many others have been written in a document more than once . it offers &amp; co@@ ile ; the insured for all already written consent .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... K@@ ile publ@@ ishers . here , the sw@@ elling value for the display of the conditions can be specified .
the fully operational files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / val@@ et / / / / / / / / / or field / ter@@ nal home folder . mode is available for dra@@ g@@ ation ( ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , Dictionary ( washing machine ) or tex .
the dialog provides graphics and easy to use graphics so easy as possible . to view the basics of the basics of graphic formats the sections should be considered .
PS files are not so known as PDF files , but offer an outstanding basis for changes and new orders of pages . the PDF edition is en@@ ligh@@ tened , so that the pages will be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools re@@ arranged and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to comp@@ ile the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all the construction tools are group@@ ed into the menu of creating comp@@ iling , creation and creation .
for the compilation of the source for viewing as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used with Alt ; 3 viewed , using Alt ; 4 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and by using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command line it is usually called a viewer after the compilation . should not be connected to the compilation , every time a new window will be opened .
a new project is called &quot; Project New Project .... &quot; the following information for the project is asked :
when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ames window , the relative path must be given from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows for the application of EC@@ MAS@@ K @-@ Ko@@ de . scripts can be managed to scripts in vertical sli@@ ders .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be used in further versions of &amp; c@@ ile .
the first must be said that the development environment of scripts in &amp; c@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinctive system where basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; co@@ ols ; offers a lot of different help to keep the user .
&amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as , will be delivered with many documents . this includes a documentation for the contained packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a fully integrated re@@ mot@@ z for &amp; tex ; and this is not only about a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for searching for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; c@@ ile ; it is divided into three important wire .
due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ex ; the final document is not always easy . as the help of the right document is not always easy . than m@@ Ã ¶ g@@ able help , the small application is not always simple . it contains a database with all types &amp; accessories ; delivered by documents and hier@@ archy of a graphic area .
all documents are divided into categories and the greatest advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or stroke . of &amp; c@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the living space for the viewing for the document .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source editor , which can be used on all systems with installed &amp; accessories ; is also a part of the Fink project , which can also be used on &amp; Mac ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X installed .
much thanks to those who offer after the continu@@ ance of the &amp; cr@@ ile ; project , and d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r many hours for the development of tools , which we use all under the cont@@ emp@@ t of &amp; GNU ; license . latest information about the Beit@@ er is available in the menu .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface you produce random signature or daily signatures from a list . these command lines provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail .
for random signature , any signature from the Sign@@ ature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . through many signatures using different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily sign@@ posts , the same signature from the Sign@@ ature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . for every day you use different signatures , such as if random Sign@@ atures create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature ; select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . thus you receive a file ; empty Sign@@ ature ; and add your signature ; and add your signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click on the disk symbol .
you can create any number of Sign@@ atures . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; mail . if you use e @-@ mails private or professional , there is always sufficient signatures .
to delete a signature , select first from and then in the menu file or click on the symbol with the Red Cross Remove in tool@@ bar .
opens the dialog for short orders . here you can select a short command to change , select a promotion from the list . click on the button and enter the new shor@@ tw@@ ave by pressing the button or key combination .

the version 3.2 of &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quantitative . all these tools use com@@ ers as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation is supposed to do it and as superior . we are still a piece , we give it a graphical surface ! not more on a terminal ; simply click the icon for XML processor and finished !
this application is expected to enter a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the curved working folder , then you can remove the current job folder . if not , then remove the selected folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time when my pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has been working on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical surface .
if the straight file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then you can simply select the current job folder . if not , then select current working folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to a issue on screen , your file is incorrect . please check the reported error and try it again .
if the file &apos;s checked file is already marked in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; then , they leave current file easily . if not , delete them at current file the Hä@@ k@@ chen file and select the file to check file using other file - file selection .
if you want to know if the well @-@ formed file well @-@ formed , it will click the Well @-@ check selection .
for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( internal ) and enter the place of &amp; D@@ TD ; as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review , the indication of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
Ja@@ well , &amp; quantitative be@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file would be selected to be processed file in &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if not , it can be selected , then remove the current file . if not , remove the file current file and select the file using the other file file .
enter the name of the file as the result is to be named , the file is normally stored in their home file .
the plug @-@ in , the &amp; quantitative sy@@ ll@@ us ; may have to benefit with &amp; quantitative information ; it is possible to benefit from the additional functionality and must not wait until someone can use the desired in &amp; quantitative information ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; these elements can be found below .
to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ part , we start with the menu plug @-@ ins . that will be opened in the following dialogue :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug@@ ins and add new files . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; this path for the search of the plug @-@ ins .
often in one project several individuals work in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship between each other . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the top name of user and serves for clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , as well as Sub@@ project leader as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can look for itself from the list of team members , who is it . this is done by sending the team member of the list and the button S@@ etze as ex@@ presses . the currently selected member ( their identification ) will be f@@ ett after you are : lyrics .
top names and attitude of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see further information about remarks .
in addition to the overview of its team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of the members of the team : it can be created an event for the team manager if something particular happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions which are done if something specific in the project . an example would be the drawing of the opening and closing of the project if a file would be secured , or the end of a message if a file is secured , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S file as soon as they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can be created , processed and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address selected address data . the address at address can be a team or Sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such ladder can be set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note : it is easy to enter . it can be selected either from the editor context menu or to enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary range followed by adjusting instructions .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the top name of the team member is the team member @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the top name of the team leader Sub@@ project leader should be led to the area and sub@@ project leaders , as in the following examples below .
top names and roller names are independent of big or small in@@ scriptions , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note of inv@@ alid .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages , which supports D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scripts .
the settings are easily reachable via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; quantitative settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by settings Quant@@ a ... called . for this dialogue extends over some pages that will be treated each other .
the behaviour of &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car files may be changed . the entries are :
large / Classi@@ c@@ ens@@ ation of tags : large / small ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of tags : normal big / infants means that tags will be inserted so inserted as they are described in the XML files .
large / small ex@@ ag@@ ation of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ ck : large / small ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ ten : normal big / infants means the attributes are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically include : if necessary , is optional for tags for which the exclusive day is optional , immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and closing day : if switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters in the corresponding encoding during the process .
M@@ ime types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different kinds of files . using the default button , the standard pre @-@ assign@@ ments can be restored .
standard string coding : the encoding of newly created or in other way as with file opening open files ( where the encoding of the file can be delivered ) , but this setting will be replaced by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . this setting can be replaced by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly backup copy , resulting in a power loss or crash when using this backup program , this is not the same as saving the file . this is not the same as saving the file . it is also possible to secure a backup , according to the specified time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial zone or own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ite ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings on the standard back when the next start is useful if the user interface has come through changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
the warning messages range serves to the tax of the possibility to in@@ hibit the indication of war@@ nings through an@@ h@@ ack of non more in@@ quiries .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may display the indication of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in divided mode . regarding different modes see .
here is the par@@ ser and the structural tree that represents the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document that will be set in details .
in the area mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change by clicking the structural tree with the mouse button dissolved .
in the field of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree , and how deep when changing the structural tree shall be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in the current document .
the area to specify ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which may be un@@ folded for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s may be valid . this means , there may be a valid group for PHP , which means the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation somewhat other than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from the third side which can be used by any K@@ Part application , the best known &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following plug must be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in if it is not at a standard site like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file to the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is denied the shop . only le@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts refuse to store if this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; if the specified information is correct . then , if the plug @-@ in is not available if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting was completely redesigned . Di@@ e@@ Support for not more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was discontinued , as well as the support for D@@ BG deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of its , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; inserted .
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project begins with the selection of matching deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger activ@@ ates a deb@@ ug@@ ger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative user interface ; -@@ user interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of monitored variables is normally in the left dock .
a view that all holding points , with line numbers and terms are listed below . normally in the lower dock .
a view to the edition ( as in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers will normally be shown in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to deb@@ ug@@ ger if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in with , on deb@@ ug@@ ging requirements . this promotion is opened by default if a project is opened , so that a deb@@ ug@@ ger must not be considered .
the counter on deb@@ ug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to deb@@ ug@@ ger or end the listen to the requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to release a de@@ bug requirement . this is the same with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view of the deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
points out the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the design of the script and the currently running line . if this happens if the script is continued while the script is continued , the script will begin before a deb@@ ug@@ ly requirement has started , the script will start with the requirement .
if the deb@@ ug@@ ger begin to start with the design of the script , without information on monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens if a script expi@@ res , the execution runs before a deb@@ ug@@ ly requirement has been given , as soon as a request is set .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next assignment in the script without entering the functions or include files .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next assignment in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include error messages .
points out the deb@@ ug@@ ger to move the instruction and to go to the next so it would not be the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that will be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variation screen .
this dialog box can be entered into a variable or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you can custom@@ ize your needs and can help you to get better .
document type E@@ editing packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative languages as well as &amp; CSS ; to make support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . your simplicity and flexibility makes it easy , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bars . day file contain two file types , the &amp; pres@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the end . tool@@ bars are handy , symbol@@ ises the text and instructions faster into a document , than a user could be .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s cannot be created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details about converting .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
Tag@@ XML files ( tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the owner di@@ alog@@ gers ; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars allow a fast insert of tags in a document without a danger of a typ@@ ew@@ arm .
day file are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; ac@@ tion@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day file carry the name of the label language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better viewing and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits are displayed in simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain any element of itself otherwise .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for the day class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ bute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Tag . this is a only element item element .
describes a attri@@ bute a tags . this element can only occur once for each attri@@ bute . additionally it contains additional tags that will describe how this attri@@ bute shall be displayed , etc . this is a only element element element .
specifies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor and in the attri@@ bute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative information is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ method name within &amp; quantitative information is used to achieve data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method@@ ology names . the arguments that can be handed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , this means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for a attri@@ bute description . it is an only element type element .
sets the position of attri@@ bute tex@@ tes of an tags within a dialog . this day may occur in a dialog for each breath ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; Tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in the dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements which may occur within the final tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files have to start with a &amp; XML ; file data : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be closed and closed .
no spaces influence nothing but battles on &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog box above the &amp; quantitative procedure ; -@@ window to start and check @-@ up Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . at present , review will only take place when purchasing the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following an example of a family 1 @-@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ scheme . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be Schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functional family 2 @-@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RE@@ C@@ TY@@ PE &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; Class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; and / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is a editor to be reached via D@@ TD . this can be processed by a list of file &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created with following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = using 1 for &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( / / W@@ 3C / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
a promotion can be set with settings .. click on the same dialog for the same dialog :
this promotion has been assigned to this promotion . with clicking on the User button , a button closure can be assigned ; with K@@ einer is the current key@@ chains .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered and inserted a text in the detail settings and inserted in the document of the action on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change or as input ( or parts of the document ) , but are the fast start dialog or the various Behold in ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % skri@@ pt@@ you in the command line : global script file : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Quant@@ a / scripts : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative process ; the text will be replaced with the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control the P@@ ID number ; this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from an external script .
the parameters for this event , normally the name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods , a script can be obtained from &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the default input can be determined . in the selection box input can be determined , what to default . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually done with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the output can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal output , to the default output edition ; error messages which should be done on the default output written by the value of the selection box output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in the specified case it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you must add actions and configure your settings .
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the lower end of the window starts working mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete all and if the day attributes and you can plan their use , activate the dialog &quot; Day &quot; when available , therefore a input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a den@@ ial symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon ? will we replace it before we have trouble .
for creating a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ credit ; choose from the menu menu , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose the size of others .
please note that the created symbol no only helps you to notice that the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly interpreted , further interpreted ) , or should at least to sign@@ alized a message to the user that click on the current document ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens over the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it still gives , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quantitative information ; functions for the tool@@ bar or it should be shared through some cutting into several groups . open the tool to set the tool@@ bar via Settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which should be added to the tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
I would like to add a quick way to access the cross @-@ quer@@ or preview . I will select and add the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner does not support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by proportional to all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back to the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please fit your &amp; scripts , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) should be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the mentioned extension of &amp; quantitative information ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or form@@ att@@ ing language that you like like a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quantitative information , if anyone has done this already for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . then we have to transfer the first part we will cover the second .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = path , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for this docum@@ entations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = section 1.@@ html html 2 = User 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = php@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top element = PHP 4.2 / # top level Elements Top Element = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = introduction , ... introduction = Manufac@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = Set@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that there is no known sub@@ folder in tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess club ( except the im@@ it@@ ators ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents can be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the upper end of the building process &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but make up &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative information ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the content section is the field of doc@@ r@@ c file , which should be displayed on the design of a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function would be displayed directly . by selecting the function called and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the text list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file connectors .
a simple list of multiple context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c easily and save $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Quant@@ a / doc / doc / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( such as you have given this in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation here .
if you are sure that these are good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , but you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email menu , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD Package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archives , where all other &amp; quantitative information can be reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and used for the publication . to use a user full contribution to what it provides a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this makes the source of resources , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several key . in the dialog box you need to pass a look . in the dialog box New resource needs to be filled ( URL preview can be left empty ) and with clicking on OK the upload .
the up@@ loading can instantly upload the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , and instantly upload tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , even before installing a resource , the im@@ pur@@ eness of the resource is war@@ ned and it can be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the owner of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not able to work by a D@@ T@@ EP package because hundreds of day files can be created in tag@@ XML format . there is the sim@@ pler way to convert D@@ TD to a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD loading and convert a D@@ TD . choose the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that will be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
destination name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string , which is in the ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after transformation : if activated , &amp; quantitative cap@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; pres@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to be able to understand and make full advantage of &amp; quantitative concepts . this chapter has to offer them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; quantitative .
in &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working range is divided into three areas : global , locally and projects . this differentiation affects a number of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; quantitative information ; uses , available in the common folder of &amp; quantitative information ; this enables the group of administ@@ rators different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree to secure each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a certain project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a certain project . simple , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative sy@@ ll@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ orial window , the construction views , the board of cart@@ il@@ it@@ ers with in@@ fos and the tool@@ bars . please select in , and for further information about this areas .
you can click the boxes with the right mouse button , to receive a context menu with the current document pass@@ words , such as close to the current , other or all boxes of the document , jump or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right in the Edit@@ orial area lead to a further context menu concerning the docum@@ enting documentation , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the mouse under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file if the character string is named under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the Edit@@ orial window , the tool@@ bars of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional will be shown as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert it , then click the icon which the day represents , then you can enter the data for this straight day . if you want to insert the data for this straight day ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog for different fields .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to the information about &amp; quantitative information , to navigate and through strip . in the representation with cart@@ il@@ it@@ ators stand for files , project , patterns , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quantitative click . this view shows all the files in the project and allows the management of files in the project using right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , upload or delete the files from memory media can be carried out by the displayed context menu .
another possibility of templates and quantitative information ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web site &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available for the appropriate users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more about templates is available .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of the integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project will also work here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . the right mouse button are available further functions such as the script to start , edit or send using email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ click of an element set the cur@@ sor in the document to the position of the element . by right click a list of commands to navigation and collection of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it can change man@@ ly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks is possible .
here is the full documentation to download web technology for your development . you can download the documentation for &amp; quantitative documentation ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two cart@@ il@@ iter at the lower end of the window , can be reached via the usable information , the message window and the problem window .
this cart@@ il@@ iter is showing information about each in Quant@@ a running script . such , e.g. the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD is indicated .
this cartridge re@@ iter shows all the errors in the current document of the current document . &amp; quantitative scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate box is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative .
another function of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you get a tool bar in an email , you can secure them in &amp; quantitative information .
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; quantitative information ; auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be handed to the configure script . to configure a complete list of options , give . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems at start &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before her bin folders . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during the effort , the best &amp; HTML ; editor began to employ the developers of &amp; quantitative ; it would be an independent , extended Mark@@ up languages editor ? well , this would do it to the absolutely great Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quantitative ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quantitative community is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; Develop@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this idea is not only possible , but it is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; as it allows users to expand your needs .
&amp; be@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; permits we@@ aving the use of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can expand the productivity by almost every task . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and met@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; expand , without any scripts can notice . ( more about them can be found in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and was quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is connected in any way with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details about the documentation is with help : / Quant@@ a ( either the URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or run the help : / Quant@@ a ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you can open a file , which is not located on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . check out the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project screen@@ shots , only a bug is reported .
converted from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to the &amp; HTML ; check that it is correct and not understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; sc@@ ure , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in the URL ; s is primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anch@@ ors day .
switches the log selection or out . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button to select .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are available !
sear@@ ches a character string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined push @-@ press to help you .
shows the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
exceptional and insertion of the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative sens@@ us . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as to change the structural tree .
shows the symbolic left of the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , it will be fore@@ seen in the menu with entries previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents in the menu , group@@ ed according to the file names of the other documents .
opens up a existing project from hard disk . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables to copy graphic files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have a further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
att@@ itudes , such as &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapters &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; projects will be explained .
invites a project tool bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be added using tool@@ bars tool to store your tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remov@@ es a tool bar from the visible range . if you don &apos;t del@@ etes it from the hard disk . if you are not stored the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quantitative pro@@ us ; team , that the tool@@ bar will be present in the next publication ) . the menu point opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endix .
enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or any one has made other and convert them to the &amp; quantitative information ; own standard format .
load / ref@@ using the discover@@ ies from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is meaning@@ ful when the re@@ alities of &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is necessary to renew the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this global is not available and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , fail the store .
this menu contains a list of tags which are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool . if the Standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is available , there is a sub @-@ menu standard which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day entry dialog when there is one . this entry is available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ men@@ s .
activated or de@@ activated the intelligent insert of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; quantitative obj@@ ectiv@@ ity is ref@@ using , if this day contra@@ di@@ ct the rules on this site .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins listed below the listed menu should be listed below . click on . click on a activated plug @-@ plug@@ ins .
cho@@ oses the Syn@@ tax@@ pay@@ off mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ es depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
cho@@ oses the type of line identification . very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms for the developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over may need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card reader mode , which is also the default setting , or the window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; quantitative mode ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry in each open window . with selection of an entry , the corresponding window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; main f@@ enst@@ ers , respectively .
the changes in this dialogue include any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
jud@@ ging the behaviour of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears to delete or add entries to the tool@@ bars or to change the sequences .
that should generate an aid according to the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as at any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantitative form ; the development in financial form will be found here .
fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as according to the design of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will automatically be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative file ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letter and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file will be stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine that you want to access , one , except one processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you are empty this field , the default settings of the chosen protocol is used . depending on the setup of the remote computer could be necessary adjustment .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and as standard templates . if a joint collection of files used for different projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from local file system to the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) .
however , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , they should be bound . if a project is rest@@ art@@ ed on new , not an@@ h@@ ack .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to expertise .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . one can select the desired files by clicking on or through removing the hem@@ og@@ ues , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be up@@ loading in the menu @-@ tree in the menu tree or with the keyboard shift Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings are described in the project assist@@ ants and are described in detail . additional entries will be explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which will be re@@ adily available in projects such as project folder .
supplem@@ entary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the projection view that will be charged when opening the project . in May it can read more about project views .
this means that the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently , G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set with the button options . it is described in trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting .
in the base window profiles can be up@@ loaded with high @-@ quality profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building process for each profile by poin@@ ter a dedicated tree view of each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can change event actions and add these actions to change or delete . event actions are executed if a previously specified event takes place , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details .
by default &amp; quantitative cap@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour is currently not able to influence .
to open a different project , select a project from the menu Project or the Symbol Project . the Project Project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be stored automatically . they are asked if you want to save changes in front of the default , if &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens if you invite a new project .
the project development view are free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
file behavior as well , however , the entries do not want to open and open with ... in the right mouse button on the right mouse menu :
here you can find various profiles . the profile contains information on the location of highly appro@@ vals files . see .
enables removing of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is b@@ lown up to avoid removing the removing .
the password will keep in the kernel memory and must be forgotten . this possibility is useful if frequency up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password will not be able to store this option .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to various servers . when working or creating a profile this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to change , except the network administrator runs a service not connected to the usual port .
depending on your attack@@ ing sw@@ elling , this is either a tim@@ ely saving function or a danger . please use it to your discre@@ tion . the password will be stored on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be read , but each with programming languages it can easily be seen in the original text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be downloaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply di@@ ver of the view , diverse files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the menu Project or the Project Toolbar , accessible via the settings of tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; quantitative cap@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to make your own work .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; fix@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best over the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding the tool@@ bars below in the section adding tool@@ bars below .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be set either by using the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , which can be set up different actions like tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar strip or tool@@ bar , which may be specified in the dialog where actions are visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a tool bar , the entries will be removed in addition to the entries and action which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and settings are set .
templates are important documentation , code Schnitz@@ el and files to link . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates , like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system available existing in the anter@@ oom @-@ tree . templates have in &amp; quantitative cap@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you need to present for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative cap@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of any template conditions before use .
binary is everything that is not pure text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using lin@@ k@@ not@@ ations ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in advance tree under global templates . additional information regarding templates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text documentation . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ ing the work in the appropriate way to be efficiently . some examples may be found in advance tree under global templates . see in for more information regarding templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always added to the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a full note on Javascript or Perl . some examples are available in advance tree under global templates . see in for more information about templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be arranged in a file structure , together in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative information .
create a documentary structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As template to save local template ....
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was filed as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out in the context of the project tree .
select text in your document and click on file as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and shut@@ down on the building view .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a preliminary folder . it can be used to use all file management functions , such as pulling and insert or insert about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
one can select in the file tree or in the project files building process to create a folder on the right and secure site template to secure a name for the template and secure . by default , it will be secured as local or global template .
project templates allow a very targeted approach . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , add files or linked with them . additionally you can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep@@ est in the eye .
the structure structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / Quant@@ a / Templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Quant@@ a / Templates / Quant@@ a / templates . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers , as above .
in order to define the behavior of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties tab in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low as soon as the attributes of the attributes .
this is activated by default and fits for everything except the st@@ aves in the introductory overview . if a family file would be set in principle , unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be in a family folder .
permitted a copy or presented text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines and foot@@ lines for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equi@@ p a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , by the context menu ( show , right mouse button press ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which are accessible via the menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the Second share the Edit@@ orial window in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it invites you a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and install the source code editor in which the changes in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document called &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP . there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ors .
the second mode is just like the first , except for the changes in the source code editor and the cur@@ sor in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , this mode is already active , this mode is already active in the active cur@@ sor from a window to the others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a .... According to the selection of V@@ PL ; view it may automatically choose between synchron@@ ization according to a click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set in addition to the time . generally , the recommendation applies : a small sp@@ anne for fast calcul@@ ator and a great fun for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose the documentation of un@@ visible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . this document is also called to create a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor . this means that the reduction of the hanging body can be changed .
met@@ a @-@ tags shows the storage of information about the document itself e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ able elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows the change of in@@ hal@@ tes , such as keywords on the column name and key@@ word keywords on the content -@@ column .
CSS rules are the new way to the creation of pages in browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below list or delete a change on the list is exactly as with the met@@ able elements . the works of CSS rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to mount an external CSS styles by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is like in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor holds as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted through in@@ ti@@ pping and can be deleted by pressing button or distance .
the insert of tags will be made in the same way through the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it is recommended that the insert of tags is not removed , e.g. an anchor day , surrounded by text , any other ambient anch@@ ors must be removed .
some tool@@ bars like the Tab@@ les Assistant or lists are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; you will need to work in this release tables or lists tool@@ bars .

there are many graphic tools for the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merger was very complicated because one of the Beit@@ er had made many changes and changed simultaneously on many places . another programm@@ ers had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when combined .
the program was given by me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence regarding the places where perhaps the in@@ dem@@ nity had been changed . the merger of this changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any quantity of more useful features were added later .
if you want to compare text quickly , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the comparison window .
a function which made much work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons are working independently of one piece of co@@ de work and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps increase the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files to merge :
&amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and di@@ versi@@ fy the possibilities today today color monitors . if you are frequently check , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines only distingu@@ ish in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the left in the column on the left side . ( no trouble more if you change the feeding . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates that the file is different . red colour means that both files are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily write the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ ity work by simply write the file names of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder for folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder folders
open dialog allows manual type of file names to select the file from the list of file . open dialog turns your selection and shows it again . you need to specify no third file in the next time . if you don &apos;t need to enter the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
via the button folder ... you can choose a folder when you select a folder , if you select a folder , then the same or merge file will be selected for B and C , then used &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in both other folders .
when meeting is crossed , the input field is active for the destination and it is not necessarily necessary to define an output file immediately . you can also use this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can define options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you would like to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text box . &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . in open dialog , you need to select any files , you can simply connect the dialog box with the break button .
you can also use pulling and shut@@ down : drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparison window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file like several similar functions . if you want to figure out what these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . you would have to compare two corresponding files , it &apos;s in &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and compare these things . now , you can easily copy the relevant sections , and then compare these functions .
note : there are currently nothing of &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; draw out the text of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and storing text in another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such cases your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each text box the information line is the sign A , B or C , the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional ) . ( if the path to a file is long , let the mouse can rest a while on the line . then a small relief window will show the full name . )
the three sources are assigned to letters A , B and C . a colour is blue , B , green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this pres@@ ets can be changed over the settings menu ) .
if a difference is detected , one sees the color that distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the default color is especially useful if you compare three files . this is good in the next section ( merge ) .
left next to the text , the column is shown . if differences were found , the color shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in drawing chains and comments , for the processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line that separates the cl@@ ause column from the text is interrupted by the digits where the respective source file is enabled . if the line is activated , the line is shown on broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison list ) has also a info line with the inscription issue : , the file names and &#91; ge@@ changes &#93; if you have handled the result . usually it contains a result by the automatic merge text , but often also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , Save is disabled ! ! ! ( do you use the buttons to find out the most remaining conflicts to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , any difference can be solved at the same time even a conflict of the manual .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed , where the group will not be visible in the windows . ) This group is then highlighted the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current section and on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes there is no further line in the group ; then there is no further line in the group ; then the text is displayed in these lines ; but this text is not displayed in the file , nor yet another source . this text appears not in the final stored file , nor in a marking which you might have to copy and what else .
the text &amp; lt ; coll@@ ision system ; however , it appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window , do not be careful with this function .
note : if you select the options to ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
this will navigate mainly with the image processing and the mouse , but you can also use the arrow keys left , right , high , r@@ under , side , right , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w can also be used in addition to the vertical image strip in addition to the vertical image strip .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to work . with the insert button , you can switch between single @-@ feet and over@@ load mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already described in the section of merge and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Figure / Str@@ g @-@ Image ) . therefore , it must not be automatically deleted as conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished between sol@@ uble and un@@ affected conflicts .
to copy the marking in the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ insert ) . if this option is enabled , the manual copying and manual copying files . be careful with this option , because you might understand the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ arians are stored according to the common operating system . UNIX versions use a line @-@ line @-@ line \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the line @-@ line \ \ \ \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and the list of most recently used files will be stored automatically and re@@ produced during the next start . ( menu insert - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 )
choose a script with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , the differences are displayed in cur@@ sive Scripture . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
based on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed . at these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically introduces an un@@ parall@@ eled color .
if this option is activated , when pressing the tab button , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign will be inserted .
when you press the input or return , the inclusion of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , any selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copying into the cli@@ p@@ board then falls .
you can choose which type @-@ line type you prefer to store . the default value is the usual standard selection on the operating system .
when attemp@@ ting files to find &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be igno@@ red in source files . the second step compar@@ es every line . in this step , white signs will not be igno@@ red . also in combination , white characters are not igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back@@ drop &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then you might save files with different sizes in page @-@ on @-@ side comparison . if this option is enabled , the car back@@ drop is visible , however , as a white sign will be disabled . during assembly , this option has to be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters are igno@@ red ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) igno@@ red the differences , but they will be treated like white characters .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensi@@ vely after even smaller signatures . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the Automatic Exchange mode , this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ affected conflict .
dis@@ solves automatically all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file than source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you need to use the features of choosing A / B / C for all ung@@ el@@ o@@ ily white conflicts . note that the automatic selection should also be igno@@ red in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in the chapters for scanning of folders and merge of a merger . look for details on documentation for the directory to comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already a older version exists , then the original version will be the suff@@ ix .@@ original file , if already exists a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without any further backup .
fit the language of the user interface . changing this option does not support the current running program . you need to start &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and rest@@ art . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally across the control centre . )
the following coding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if one activ@@ ates this option , all entries can be used for all entries .
a short note for the coding appears a short note that is the local coding . ( this may not be changed here and has for you an inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this influences how special characters is treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared with different coding .
if you have a file , you can set up here which should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only fix with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing .
if you turn right to supp@@ ress the changes of changes in white characters in text or review . ( Note : this applies also for changes in numbers or comments if the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color@@ fully coded trans@@ verse column are displayed . but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; B ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; B ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second transfer column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply drag the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
listed the comparison window side by side or another . this can be useful to the display of long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes , consider the differences and decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as a pre@@ set name for output file . ( if this function is used to start the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will be handed out first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own image processing , which allows you to remove this function such as to remove parts or correct setup .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command was given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only at the line . you can write your own relief processor which corresponds to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the thought behind it is more flexibility when inser@@ ting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program itself . the good news is that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
in this context , use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input in upper@@ case : SE@@ D \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s in the first cl@@ auses . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experim@@ enting with SE@@ D , you might have to understand it and perhaps like this regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the igno@@ red of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further prec@@ urs@@ ing command of line . SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , i.e. virtually deleted .
sometimes you would like to perform several licenses at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
instead of SE@@ D , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e &apos;s / switch &apos; allergi@@ es are needed at per@@ l some details differently . where SE@@ D \ \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs only needed ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal procedure will be retained for displaying and merge . further operations change only the data that the line @-@ equal @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line processor indicates the output of the regular pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful but as in any function , the text changes or differences are hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers must process many files in a folder . from this reason you can compare with &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sive and merge .
... making a proposal to perform a proposal ; you can custom@@ ize the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and shows the simul@@ ated changes without you to perform ,
... causes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F6 key ) ,
this is the same and merge of individual files very similar . you need to open only folders in the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the basis . if no target folders is used , used &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the merge , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder you will inform you a small news window over the current progress . if you break the folder file , only the files are listed below that time .
when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
any file and any file which was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can choose a object with a simple mouse click here .
the file structure will normally be folded , by clicking on the + / - click , or on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub @-@ directories with which you can open all folders and fl@@ aps all the folders .
if you click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case the coll@@ u@@ ros action can not be selected automatically . if the merger is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C are red , green , yellow and black .
identical to identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
the file is considered to be identical when all of you are identical , then the same color is the same color . in folder , age is un@@ considerable for its colour .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colors are mir@@ ro@@ red the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red is .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C cannot have the same file type ( e.g. a folder and B one file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such def@@ ective objects exist , the merge may not be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. a folder and B one file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such def@@ ective objects exist , the merge may not be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders were given and if the option directories synchron@@ ize . then cho@@ oses &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the required action is to be identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : together and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as the visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after the merge and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders are merged and select the option of new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , the date of files and be@@ ats the newer file . if the files are different but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors do not be eliminated , the interaction can not be launched .
during the merge , a file is based on the other . if the merger was successful , and according to other messages , if something un@@ expect@@ edly occurred . if the merger is completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is okay .
when entering the setup dialog , K@@ diff@@ 3 will show further columns . this contain the number of un@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders can be compared or merged . )
you can either lead the straight selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all @-@ feet actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have no target folders , then in the three @-@ file merge mode C , it is used as a goal , the two @-@ file merge will be selected as a goal and to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a goal .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folders . there are some options due to specific entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select folders / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the CTR@@ L key ) : select action of the current element or press F6 .
when using contra@@ dic@@ tive data types still exist , a message appears on the incorrect elements . you can select a valid promotion for them then .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears using the options , simul@@ ating and breaking down .
if you would like to see if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes . you will receive a detailed list of all promotions .
&amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; causes specific actions with all entries . if a manual input is necessary ( together a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen photo ) .
if you &apos;re ready to run with a file , then select directories start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not stored , a corresponding dialog appears . then , &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next record .
if &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; click on a bug , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you can try to ski@@ p the cause of problem . if you are trying to try the cause of the problem . if you have the opportunity to select a different action to select or the problem in other ways before you continue with the merge .
if some entries were individually summar@@ ised , these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them not again together . even if the merge result was done or not saved , these entries will be done as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that are displayed on the stated pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . file does not need to conform to this pattern .
files and folders comply with this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can use more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ding characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders comply with this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can use more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ding characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files that are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set @-@ specific using a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
in some file systems , files have a slot attri@@ bute . this option allows you to choose whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting .
for links to files : if the option is switched on , symbolic lin@@ king is compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in the default .
in links to the folder : if the option is switched on , the links are treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively sear@@ ches the links like normal folders and recur@@ sive . ( note that this option would lead to a folder link and lead &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is shut down in the default .
a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ for@@ ter , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that does not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare great folders through a slow network , it may be faster , just the change date and file size . this speed advantage is a certain degree of safety . please note with caution . this option is used in default .
similar to the change date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered as identical if it has been big when copying the change date . please be careful with caution . this option is used in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ize mode if two folders are compared and no target folders . in this mode the proposals are selected so that the results are identical to both folders . this option is switched off in both folders . this option is shut down in the default .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because the other file is not changed . ) This option should be shut down in any case . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or folder is replaced by another version or deleted , the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file is already exists , this will also be deleted without any further backup . this option is enabled in the default setting . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder cl@@ ergy is visible to the interaction of individual files . if you don &apos;t want to move the window with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window &amp; text window , you can switch the window to the window menu and switch between the two views between the two views .
probably you prefer to get a file easily by double click . however , there is also a single file , you can also run directly to the folder menu . as soon as you can save the folder , the status is set to be done and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder .
however , this status is lost , if you want to read the directory again : directory menu : new options
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line is compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
one URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should be aware of :
a path can be relatively . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can not be distinguished if a link shows a file or a folder . then it will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or change of change . therefore vary the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note that this option is possible for local files . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the differences of differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts always start the built @-@ in differences of differences . in order to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right button of mouse over the differences of differences and then choose In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as K@@ Part , it takes &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file has to exist . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch is to restore the missing file .
in the cross @-@ section you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work when the original files has changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s com@@ edy ) is already available . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it may result as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GPL programs already very long and I have much learned in the sources of other programs . this is my grat@@ eful to all the programm@@ ers who went this way or go to it .
you have compiled the program from the sources and automatically compiled the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , K@@ DE will not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. c@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white signs varies , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign varies , the line is not identical . if the Lines may be not identical .
the Editor is indicated for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design extra an own file format that could save this information .
the effort was so far too big . you can recover a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text , suddenly , no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does this and how can this be removed ?
&amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; used as many colors for eman@@ ating differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use any other editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bl@@ ers came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information about how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ You are the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ af@@ e , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . should you occur difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ ma@@ iling lists of it .
cut off ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not published in the folder , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to update the folder to this options with the function Update Update . )
there are only entries indicated that the differences may not have to be copied to the target folders . if the target file does not include these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behaviour is probably modified in a later program version . ) This option is displayed in the default setting .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the buttons , the lines from the respective window will be attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly .
in the default , this option is disabled . the differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual work@@ space . it is quite convenient to change the running programs to the work areas to stop them or move it . this works both within a desktop than also at several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as the applications in the current applications . the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
with the middle of mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop as well as other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu is clicked on the empty background and the name of the application as well as the entries must appear , maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the following commands are :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only if a application was clicked on an application .
sends application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if on an application was clicked on an application .
if this check box is marked , window can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas .
when this box is crossed , it will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ places are displayed .
the cross of this field can display the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ places can be crossed together with name , the names are provided with ordin@@ ate , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this box is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this box is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty work@@ places are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined here : classic , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid appear , as from p@@ ager applications in some other windows , shows all virtual work@@ places in a vertical section , which is very good for the representation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in size , the window as symbols or with their content and post@@ p@@ one can also run outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent removal of switch @-@ switch ... allows the dialog box settings .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog for Settings . but you can do this manually :
open the File $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission to the file , you need to register as a user root or join your system administrator . in this file you need to refer to the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ Mode 1 and this one value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; it is a screen @-@ magni@@ fying . you can read with &amp; k@@ mag ; this application is interesting for different users . this application is also important for different users . these applications include artists , web designers and people with a vision . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ weak machines .
when you can start &amp; k@@ mag ; the main window appears by &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged range of screen . in the following window , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window .. The image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is a enlarged range of screen and is designated as a selection window .
the default setting is enlarged &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can add a selected screen range in the magni@@ fying window ( selection screen mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter on the screen ( eg ; on the left @-@ screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse is not able to recognize the form of mouse . this is always the default port ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .

&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy in a file to insert into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , the image and much more .
starting or stops the update of the display . the stops of the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , medium , h@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click when the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who suffer on the RS@@ I Syndrome ( repet@@ itive lead @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a while , once the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who prepare your mouse click pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate it with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can the pain handle that the mouse is created and helps to use the cause of pain without pain . unfortunately , by the blo@@ om because of your computer , you should try to search the use of your computer , if you do not have a doctor if this is not yet done .
in order to clear it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps you create when using the mouse , it is against p@@ ains that are caused by the mouse because of all ergonomic auxiliary equipment : the result can drop every different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click when you break the movement shortly .
if the intelligent shi@@ fting is activated , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion . the intelligent shi@@ fting requires a little practice but you need to get quickly .
this stress has to be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click a mouse click .
if this is enabled , the turn @-@ down time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here is the time set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be waiting here before using the mouse button before it will start the mouse button if the mouse does not have to leave the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; this function is activated automatically , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow reference to the left and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . this moves will be stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose the sound system and here the rider General . there is a shooting Sound Pu@@ ffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; this function is currently just under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please do the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there .
sets all settings on the values which were stopped when opening the dialog . have already pressed the button user , the settings will be reset to the last pressures of user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to first use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . in particular , the intelligent shi@@ fting should first be switched off . if you want to set off the automatic mouse , you can increase the intelligent shi@@ fting .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; compared to sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , which cannot use link because you can park your mouse to such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse printer , you should clean your mouse . it is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean@@ se the mouse , but also the rolls that come with the mouse .
first you have to remove the mouse button . as that happens , the mouse is set to mouse differently . however , it should be clear when you watch the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have the ball , you would have to see the roll . these are located on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the Dre@@ ck and the so@@ iling can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the fingers .
in very rare situations , the operating system run by &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if it &apos;s just started a delay speed , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean that the operation cannot stop longer by the lot of mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use one window manager and one window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click here . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; re @-@ set and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse button and put the cur@@ sor into another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor place where you want to make it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop . if you don &apos;t use the mouse on a neutral sphere . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter &amp; eg ; the grey areas to make the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shi@@ fting , but I do not create it to edit text .
the intelligent shi@@ fting is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can move it into this way to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and want to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or any other action . however , there will likely be some problems . here are some advice about this :
do not use the intelligent shi@@ fting not if you just start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . select text instead . select a mouse click and hold the switch @-@ off button , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and again the mouse button once again .
do not use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this makes any time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent shi@@ fting too without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but you need to use some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you have to use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed in most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and set it correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; bet@@ ting the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter short , this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I Syndrome and to them the bedding of the mul@@ berry pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins before the mouse can be released . in this way , the pulling and shut@@ down with the mouse can be carried out .

probably you have not entered the command for the language output not right or not fully entered . open the page General Settings and enter the command for the language edition of the language file issue . ( see setup dialog for language syn@@ thesizer . )
the festival is a language edition system from the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch supported . the license allows you to use the festival free to use and without limitations .
in order to display an example of command line for the setup of language issue , is believed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to the language issue is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a generator generator . currently , it supports only the English translation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and spread without restrictions .
in order to display an example of the command line for setting up the language output , is believed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . the language edition is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ esh@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be attached . the full command is therefore abandoned than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . option data can be switched on .
the Danish edition dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , the all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ uses a standard interface for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the setup of the voice file only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to set the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the setup dialog boxes &amp; mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful , you need a language generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t speak to let the text can be saved by the computer . it will be stored as a list already sung phr@@ ases which can re@@ boot the user again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer includes . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

before you can , use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need to install program on @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
during the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as yet no speaker is set , the cart@@ el card is displayed . see also if you have at least one speaker , the card card is displayed . see .
most of the T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , such as various male or female , or such as spokes@@ person in volume , syn@@ thesizer , voice , volume , volume , volume and speed . you should use at least one speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ops , as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speaker .
different speaker for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several pressure expectations for the same printer .
if you click on the card reader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map speaker is displayed . this will then automatically start when you start the ts@@ p and no speaker is set up .
all popular speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top in the list . the top speaker is used for the language issue when an application is no spokes@@ person .
select a mouse click on the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a mouse click with a mouse click on the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
in a mouse click with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down@@ wards . the order of the speakers in the list also determines its priority .

choose a tuning type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and gir@@ th n@@ im@@ me to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the box card . to change the settings of this spokes@@ person , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost use . go back to the card map and check if the T@@ TS service is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , that the T@@ TS service is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . see now you can read &amp; kt@@ ops ; click on the card to create text orders and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language code system from &amp; k@@ de ; start to open this cart@@ oning card . here you can set some general options .
mark the check box in order to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this start is the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can read text orders and read text orders . see the marking , will be K@@ TT@@ SD and de@@ activated the T@@ TS system of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; continue to activate the field of language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and the ts@@ p will be automatically published in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears as soon as the pre @-@ read is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders to break , stop and record again .
using the buttons in this series , you can read the latest text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file to be opened . you can also change the speaker for a mission .
click on users or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map of the K@@ TT@@ SD card .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed website . check the text , which should be read and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time , the language edition should start .
it is almost always meaning@@ ful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing and other invisible brands will also be read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read first text . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs first if you want to read and select in the main menu Tools text . then the language edition should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate is embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ;

supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the menu settings of this program . here the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on application .
filter to correct rendering program provide a good opportunity to correct and corrected . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which ends to delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; is a good example . it remov@@ es the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that can be sent and also the expression / local / in@@ box because this in most cases can be accepted as provided .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; . for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filter is not necessary .
in filters , the text is processed , before it is sent to the program of commercial @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to replace the words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , a proper language and speaker to select a proper language and speakers or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice synthesis and their voices .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; commercial @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher has been working with a text , distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be proposed to all other applications and keeps these orders . if the output of the Screen reader is read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
News , the next priority priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that can read messages . while you welcome to read a long text on a web site , you can enjoy the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ al@@ erts are also News . read this .
the rest are simple text orders . each order , which you use from the cart@@ oning card is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular Dr@@ ing@@ ness .
all four order types will be processed in waiting @-@ long , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if a application read the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just a file read , this issue will hold and finished .
first you need to know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen reag@@ ents . they will be applied to normal warning , messages and text applications as well as &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter process the text and give it on the next filter . at the time there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as a modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
character string replace parts of a text by other text . the resulting parts can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . it is supplied with pre @-@ defined character strings such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; mail ; in a better compreh@@ en@@ sible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with inter@@ phone calls , you can send jobs depending on the text of text , or on the program , send the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you have sent a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ s. read about it .
each of these various filters have adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a language issue . if the filter ensures that its rules are not applicable , he gives the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification on &amp; kt@@ ops ; it will be sent through all activated filters , which have been arranged on the page below . the processing of filters in the list below is down@@ wards .
this shows the list of the furnished filters . if a filter does not cross it , it is not enabled and is not used . filter will be de@@ activated from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ let , and it will be shown below the following table di@@ alog@@ ues .
for the setup of character strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a compar@@ ision . these patterns will be replaced in the text , then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text . large and small in@@ scriptions will not be considered compared with the comparison .
enter your filter a name for your filter . you can choose any of this name , it must be different from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text using the drawing chains in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string chain from the column . the list is shown in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , the current list or delete . download a list of file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
here is a language listed here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the here registered languages . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also choose multiple languages if you enter the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l . button hold down button .
if the filter is registered here , the filter is only applied when the text is given by one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by coma . example : con@@ vers@@ ation , mail
application ID running programs is available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be we@@ aken . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be used only .
the filter filter filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ al filters apply . all input fields is empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words using the drawing filter filter regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by divi@@ ding signs ( space characters ) both on both sides .
in this manual you will find no guide to the writing of regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ conversion trans@@ duc@@ er &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such re@@ form@@ ations . however , it can only be installed on a well @-@ formed XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the phone selection filter you can send texts to a certain speaker that is set up on the card interface , or to a speaker with specific properties . you can define that texts by k@@ mail may be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text to the filter gives you an spokes@@ man for the text . the spokes@@ person is sending the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; send , and the characteristics of the speaker &apos;s spokes@@ person . with the phone selection filter you can ski@@ p the chosen speaker .
here is a value added if the text is used if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions you can call this with a click on the button to help help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to as@@ sign the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the features of your desired microphone station . if the text complies with the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to show the desired requirements at the top . click on the right to show the dialogue speaking selection .
use these buttons to save your microphone settings or delete all settings .
the microphone optional filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ al Filter . you must be at least a condition for 1 year .
the language API , of &amp; k@@ de ; with the programm@@ ers to give thanks to its applications of T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of language output API by &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / / bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .

there is text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
open two &amp; console ; Windows . start a window in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr on the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ change filters , but when using the module for Festival will not be read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c will be installed and can be found on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or inter@@ mitt@@ ance signs seem to cause bugs in syn@@ thesizer , so that all sentences will ski@@ pped or just Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch . what can I do against it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure the option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or dic@@ tion@@ aries , these may possibly be fixed by a character chain filter . see . &quot; &quot; &quot;

KT@@ TS operates with each language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , check out the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check out also on the web page ; , according to information , which are not yet included in this manual .
the &quot; commercial @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; use the developers team in conjunction with the developers team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the Developer Files for the &quot; commercial @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ops ; you have purchased the source code for k@@ is@@ ers or download the program with the following commands to download and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first if it works right @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scription SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be used so that the device of commercial @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible directly and the script is no longer required .
a long text will be dis@@ assembled in single sentences . the user can withdraw from or retri@@ eve the output , or break the output .
if an application has text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you have a teacher , it is used for example to specify a female English speaker . if you want to set up a female speaker , otherwise you want to know the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ops ; you will see a speaker .
when you click on the box ticket to add or on the list , then click on the list or on request , the cartridge card is shown . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you &apos;ll need to enter only festival .
select the character encoding for text , which is handed over to the festival . in general , this setting will automatically be made automatically . generally applies to Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ der , you can select volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you don &apos;t select a certain knob , and this grey can &apos;t be displayed by you selected voice to your settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to be loaded up because of their size several seconds . if you want to mark the check box , these voices will already be charged with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( at greater memory consumption ) the first set is faster syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click on user ) . see .
if the check box is marked with the start of the ts@@ m@@ gr the program window . otherwise , after the start only the symbol m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if the check box is marked and the ts@@ m@@ gr does not appear , it appears in the system range as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD . thus , you have the possibility to read or take place elsewhere .
here are all orders placed in the maintenance @-@ long , together with the application that has set the order , the number of propositions and the straight sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card interface .
with the buttons in this series you can see a sat@@ in on the order that is selected in the list below , or back . ( but not each order consists of several movements ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) is taken over and the ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , g@@ amer or a@@ co@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . editions of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders , War@@ nings and News will not be displayed . further information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , it was compiled &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ops ; can &apos;t charge the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ de for the audio output should be used , select here the audio output . if no output modules can be displayed in the list , you must select at least one module , select here the PCM device . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % roughly the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click on user to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices covers all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device is working with you . in doubt , select the default .
on this cardboard box you can arrange special actions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processed four types of language contracts :
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be proposed to all other applications and holds this orders . after the output of the Screen readers will be read , the requested orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read messages . if you can read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone welcome you to enter the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the maintenance long .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text is interrupted . if the introductory sound is active as well as introductory message , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this box ticket are valid only for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and expenses of screen @-@ reag@@ ents there are no particular promotions when they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ Noti@@ fy news to read , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click messages . the card messages appears .
mark the check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ops are no al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , al@@ erts , with which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on button , a dialog appears where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned in an I@@ RC message to your nick@@ name .
all events , which is not otherwise stated in the list , are igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ops .
use this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do if an event meets . you have the following selection options :
if you have set the customized text , enter the desired text . you can use the following placement holders :
you can enter the features of the desired microphone station . standard cho@@ oses the speaker that will appear in the list on the box card as the top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . it is defined for a particular event of a specific application . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . as last option , the action is scheduled to move under standard ( all other events ) .
all al@@ erts all al@@ erts for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the pre @-@ read messages as follows :
use the button to store the settings for the al@@ erts to a file . download the button to upload the settings of a file . if you want to start the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries can be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for the control of voices , the microphone speed , the voice of voice and pitch . also brands for the control of the language of ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard .
currently &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( UK male ) since this is the standard voice in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama Bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ ind of man . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal efficiency filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start reading , since only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also stop orders or stop , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is automatically set up a proposition limit filter . you can change its settings or more pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter , but the beg@@ inner is not recommended .
the easiest way to try out the setup selection , and enter text to read . check the phone selection once again . check the phone selection again , change some features and check how the selection of the spokes@@ person must be changed . you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then faster with the presentation , since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can termin@@ ate text orders to hold or ab@@ rupt your function , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal Sat@@ ten@@ se filter filter is automatically set up when you can start the ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed only . do not change anything at this filter , unless you do what you do .
pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter li@@ ken text with a regular expression for sat@@ z@@ ers and add a Tab@@ ul@@ ator ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the sat@@ z@@ limit ( tablets are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard cross @-@ limit filter to the character is ret@@ ains .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; News ( k@@ is@@ ers ) , war@@ nings , news or the output of screen reag@@ ents .
if you have removed from the normal set @-@ limit filter , you can insert this again by expor@@ ting the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the Card Card Inter@@ phone selection , you can over@@ write the microphone settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the box card ) . in other words , no microphone properties are specified .
use of the matching speaker that has all features of a furnished speaker . if you are not able to delete or edit the settings ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker that originally set up the original features .
select the method for input of the desired microphone properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the features of the desired microphone station . if this feature is no role , enter nothing .
mark the check box if the property has priority before other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when the issue is , it is always possible to specify this feature . the only case in which you may want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you know that a specific application text is sent in another language as the working environment in the working environment .
to use all the characteristics of the speaker that is to delete the following below , click on the selection button Standard Speaker and then use on speaker that corresponds to the following below .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the waiting long . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is input 0 needed ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability .
g@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ops ; probably , you have to register G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved yet . if the problem is not solved yet , it is not a compatible version of g@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install track .
the audio output via AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work when I am working simultaneously with another application music . if I get a text order , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ops ; one message appears , says : &apos; to open PCM .
on your system the problem that conflicts can occur at AL@@ SA , which will prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices . information for possible solutions will be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed them and can use it in the festival but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice at the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ops / vo@@ ices the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers .
on the cart@@ ei@@ card audio , there is a setting speed . so this works , the program has to install the program SO@@ X and over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings are igno@@ red when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; reads that the HTML code is converted into SS@@ ML . ( see ) or if you are completely cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ change filter , and set up the microphone speed .
I &apos;m not able to read the websites with a female voice . I have a female festival spokes@@ person , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; read the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able Gender doesn &apos;t work to work . this festival doesn &apos;t th@@ rows the X@@ SL file to converting SS@@ ML according to S@@ aber The Gender tags . the same applies also for VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a own drawing filter filter and now I can &apos;t go back in &amp; kt@@ ops ; not more sat@@ in or back . on the cardboard box is indicated , the order of existing only from one sentence . what can I do wrong ?
inter@@ viewer signs ( point , fra@@ ctional sign , comp@@ ma and Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be used . use a filter to pro@@ positi@@ onal limit for these characters instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected )
g@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure the modules for g@@ amer are registered , by using G@@ stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ops ; command G@@ ST register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ kt@@ op@@ .org ) .
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts . if your system also belongs to music and read a text , if you want to keep a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de hasn &apos;t favor@@ ited any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops ; it will be read the current proposition yet .
the audio program SO@@ X is used for general attitude of speaking speed , but otherwise not necessarily . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as Tar@@ ball ( with t@@ ar ge@@ packed archive ) , register as a normal user and un@@ pack the Tar@@ ball in a matching folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 module &apos;s module &apos;s module is likely to be created or at least only on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer will be created by default . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of Deb@@ ian @-@ Distribution ) .

the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally well , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions which will be delivered with the festival . you would like to read the websites you need to install ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of festival . the German votes are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice sets Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in one early stage stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit K@@ yr@@ illi@@ c option as an example of KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer is used . then the festival takes the le@@ x@@ ik@@ y analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ bro@@ la ; generated language of Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates this by &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; required di@@ phon@@ o t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create Di@@ phone texts . more information can be found below .
in this case , additional W@@ ra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; vote for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; file files are not installed in &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ files are not installed , but in the file festival / lib / . instructions you find under

this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , one module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables the management of the network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enables the user to manage a series of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings over a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center is indicated . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical equipment and their drivers must already be functional installed and configured , that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device can be used and the setup of the network properties enabled .
in most cases download drivers for the network hardware and other devices in installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and furnished . network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version ,
the module network settings is charged if the network settings are selected in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . starting the module network settings , this , the platform used to automatically detect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform is not recognized , the hands selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release is best . by selecting the setting non @-@ again request the setting can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will automatically be pre @-@ set .
changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode . in advance , all options are displayed , which means that the settings can only be viewed . in the system management mode , the settings can be reached at the bottom end of the module . it is the input of the password required .
in the system management mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from rider network interfaces can be carried out by the rider network interfaces :
the settings shown network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button in the dialog box ... in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Extended Settings shows the dialogue with further options .
the TCP / IP settings are used by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP servers are required for the system at the same time , no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system can be selected .
with the selection Manu@@ ally without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field network mask .
if this setting is selected , the system is initi@@ alized the network interface on bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can find whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on or switched off . insertion of a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched on or switched off . switching a activated network device by selecting from the list and click interface ....
the IP address of the host is fixed in local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for the TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected in which the gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only can understand IP addresses . if the computer ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ in@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org trig@@ gers the DNS name into an IP address as about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name @-@ resolution part of the equ@@ ator name allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered wer@@ den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be up or down in the list with buttons or down in the list .
by pressing the button ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution can be added to a DNS server . the dialog box will add New Nam@@ es@@ erv@@ er .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name @-@ resolution you choose one entry and then click on button Finish .... It will display the dialog box .
the list of well @-@ known computer describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used in first line when bo@@ oting when no DNS server are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list file names contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . this is still in the test version of IP in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click &quot; Add .... The dialog for New Mac version is shown .
to enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias name , button add multiple times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known host from the list and select Edit .... The dialogue known calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then with clicking on OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings contained in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the modifications , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download and install the rpm package as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical surface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not enough , but in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should aff@@ ord this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic networks are given , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are discussed .
this section may not replace more information about IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information about the integration of PCs in a small ( home ) network .
at present , IP networks can be operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . only 5 has never found large spread . from IPv6 it is expected to go through the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the response point where a valid IP address can be done or if available , the IP address can not be selected as desired .
when creating a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected for this purpose reserved to avoid IP address con@@ bil@@ ling with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course you can access the Internet for such machines through setting of an Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask usually set on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP blocking .
the mains address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circuit .
in this part , the configuration files that are stored by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes be dynam@@ ically modified in DSL connections , so it does not be surprised , if in case of active DSL connections another content is set to be set there .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand can therefore occur .

&amp; dat ; is a function program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a tape . the second goal was to answer the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar to quick , selective un@@ pack . the second purpose was the answer of a question that my wife said : how much longer does it take ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; this may be done on three ways :
&amp; dat ; mo@@ il the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; cr@@ dat ; the occurr@@ ence on the band will be asked if the tape is being format@@ ted .
recogni@@ zes &amp; cr@@ dat ; the pre@@ fix , sear@@ ches it according to the matching index on your record . can this not be found if the band index will be created .
if everything went off , the symbol for the tape drive to show that the band is bound in the status bar . in the status bar , the content of the tape can now be searched for the band .
prior to the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the ban@@ des , initially the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; dat ; gives a change of symbol for the band to recognize that the integration of the band was solved and shows a corresponding message . the band can now be rejected without a danger .
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band cards have to be format@@ ted before being format@@ ted to saving data . this process does not need to be format@@ ted with &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not need to be format@@ ted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually have a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape ahead , D@@ AT drives are not format@@ ted .
after entering the band called and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the band is lost ! after completion of the formation process , the band is automatically bound and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you need to select the files that can be found on three ways :
choose a file or folder in local file tree . only this file or the folder is secured .
select a Secure fil in the tree . only the files are secured in the profile .
select files in local file tree with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the so selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Sich@@ uan ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog for backup . in this dialog box you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to backup . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
select one file or folder in one of the archive in the entry for the drive . it is only tested for the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in one of the archive for the band with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog for Settings . in this dialog box you can check your selection and the work folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears over@@ check . this dialog displays the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can lead the restore files , the files must be re @-@ manufactured , marked . this may take place on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives which include the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub @-@ folders can be recovered .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the so selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are recovered .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu ...
once the recovery process was started , the dialog for Rest@@ ore . in this dialog box you can check your selection and the work folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create band@@ th@@ readed file using the Band@@ in@@ hal@@ tes . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two kinds of volume :
this is created with the straight line profile with the straight selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings :
the current work folder where the backup should be made . the list of the files will be updated automatically according to the currently selected work@@ folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files that are described in the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are located on the same file system , you can select separately under the backup file . each entry will be considered independent of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last in@@ incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be secured only , which has since changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the past incre@@ mental backup is used .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; and then ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can arrange the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu Settings ... the following settings can make it :
the complete path for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ load version of the band device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; c@@ dat ; before the band is connected to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading and write operations .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; cr@@ dat ; the design of the tape drive to lock . possibly this setting does not work in all band drives .
if the option is switched on , when soldering the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically exp@@ ire the band . use this option not at flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware file size for belt drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drives .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , writing a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the band . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this character string is host name : seconds , whereby the name of the system is format@@ ted on which the tape is format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era was format@@ ted in the band .
the band ID is used to find a file using the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar -@@ Archive that can manage directly with &amp; GNU , - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not used to incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup association . this symbol is only active if a band is bound .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows you to get information about your system or the system log ; experienced users with fast access for example on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can receive information about your system or where the system will be back the different protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; experienced users with fast access to the example on problems which occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; tries to provide some extended functions and can be filtered with the help of the protocol files certain programs and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ er.@@ log ; a number of useful features . include among others :
support for many different kinds of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; functions available , with their help the individual protocol lines can be easily filter and sort them . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol . will you not start with system administrator right . the protocol files will normally be under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually have no permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filters in the filter bar . the list of the protocol changes will be automatically altered , so that only protocol changes will be displayed next to the selected filter . then , a protocol line is displayed only if in one of the columns the character string of the filter search term is included .
you can also select another entry in this place . select the string of the filter search term only with the entries in the protocol file protocol . select it also to the name of a process , so it shows &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; all protocol lines will be sent or created in this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error will be displayed with a striking colour as protocol lines of level indication . the color representation of protocol lines can be shut down .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , if you want to investigate the output of a specified command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you can use the filter bar .
in addition , the option can jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files into separate signatures . to open this function window to open and manage the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you have chosen one window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ er.@@ log ; has a dedicated website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you find further current information about the reference of &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ong log ; can also be found in the following file of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ vs : ks@@ ystem log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; this section takes some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v .
the V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard control of the program starts at the start of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I &apos;m not going to go on the historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try to set a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and new format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed there , if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it diff@@ ers from BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files can be found in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole amount of scripts . in principle you need to start a script for every system service , which you want to drive on another round level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include not such things as set@@ serial which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be able under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it is not much use for this . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ serial / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default is run@@ level 3 . if you want to change the default . if you want to change anything , then you can repair any thing , then proceed to rest@@ art the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that there is a argument like start and stop . you can start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would keep the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K includes , the script will stop the argument with the argument , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level , which can only run ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say to tri@@ vial : draw a entry in the range of availability system to one of the six round level to start it on this level ( or stop stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or set the position within one level by changing it . this will only be removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens if they take an entry in the area of availability .
note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed when you choose to check this in a new area . if you choose to select a new run@@ level or from the context menu and then add to the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ ting number of a single was sometimes not calculated . in such case you need to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : there are no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the paper basket . be careful so .
you can use the tab button to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 stop , run@@ level 1 stop , etc . ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one .
to move one entry into another round level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a single entry , press the input button to change the characteristics dialog button to accept the dialog box button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the danger of the data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c . pre@@ orders are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are saved by &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; otherwise , changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the propri@@ etary setup programs of this distribution , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are required ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) are simply not qu@@ icker without news if your configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the record saving in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cartridge cards , the user and the user list . to do , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user or group characteristics .
some cartridge cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . if you have limited system settings , if you have limited system settings , if you may make individual settings , if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
the password card password appears if shadow pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
this card card appears only if necessary for at least one embedded file system plac@@ ements ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters of each user , whereby the limited restrictions each are written in KB :
this parameter can be adjusted individually for every file system . the current file system will be selected using the field system file system .
the groups informs about the user lines of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , can be found in the field of prim@@ itive Group . furthermore , users can select in other groups by using these in the large field .
the dialog for the Group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this users in the list .
to add a user or a group if you choose from the menu User or group or click on the matching add button of the tool bar . the editing or del@@ etion of the selected users or the selected group will work analogue .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operational system , remove the standard operation system , remove systems , change , change and more .
