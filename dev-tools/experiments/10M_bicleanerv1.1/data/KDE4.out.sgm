<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly about your storage location. if you're going to organize a several times on the same place. if you want to make enough photos, then you will print subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc.. export is then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as verification of photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% Archive and 5% work files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? the split of file types makes the pile-processing. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. they will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to store metadata in & digiplug; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forgot this, then you can select the metadata of the database in the files by using the corresponding point in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what do you want to change and digiplug; them a metadata editor for a number of selected attribute. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work, since you should select every photo keywords: you can select all images that require the same attribute and enter the value. you will start the best with the rating or the leaderboards. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now go with keywords, keywords, as you are frequently called in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digiplug; automatically add the tree for you to mount the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by that of a subbaums to another one. the changed passwords are pursued by & digious; updated while keeping the substrates.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows like different metadata. this is a very rough representation of metadata in truth from many sections. filename and calendar data are characteristics of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the passwords - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to katate your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They don't want to see most often your photos, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographer and agencies. they are safe to arrive like your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance you are not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you are closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say that this is the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. Wow! one starts to dream, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. the label has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos view the title is possibly more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story that the key is to help you to understand it about the motive that you moves you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's okay if a picture is not perfect, if it only work with a label for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can even use any text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can even use it for a selection of images at the same time. if you want to export your images in web galleries, then they will tell you about your wishes into the label and / or the title of the web-gallery. you need to tell a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring Planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures, the train leaves the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocalization are already innumerable and will be able to open your journeys in the future. I can also export your journeys using Google Earth. you can also export the photos on the recording location. you can also export the pictures also to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and referred to the practice of copyright to remove limitations above the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all versions, so also for working others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description says you what information is written in the setup side of & digiplug; as the information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for actor and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who used the photo. if it is not desired to be the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization cannot be changed. this field does not support more Kommas nor semicolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author titles (synonym for authors): linked to the author. this field contains the working number of photographers. examples of this field contains titles as: employee photographer, free photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a veraging to the authority field, this is also to be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the Anbieterfeld to identify who. if the photographer is working here as a Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here. if the picture is an inventory photo, then the Group / Agency will be given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections. everyone who has no longer than basic knowledge in the work with computer has to delete or change the solution for this problem. for individuals this problem is only very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and Halb professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermarks is unique in the picture. & digiplug; in the near future there is a module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnerrors, plate loss, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, lifetime, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire. this kind of losses are the same that you can also pass on traditional paper photos or negatives. this section is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which have a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem at CDs / DVDs, you need to keep them longer than a few years. of course you can get more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers about Gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece can claim a lifetime of 100 years for himself. if you believe this is in your creation space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices. the best DVD recording tools are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you're writing a lot of reliable. it is therefore the right to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very reasonable for errors, even if you are just written only. therefore, they use a control environment to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the remainder we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection it is necessary by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a good program called IsoBuster. it runs under Windows and & Linux. it's also available for Macs. there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged floppy disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray Disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all things to CDs and DVDs was also applicable to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn the data to a high-quality media in a non-quality media. then, you should select the media with a description, date & author's name and thereafter. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Flowering producers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantee a new disk, but not the data. Google sets a great field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: floppy disk drives.</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks keep the longest troubleshooting. electronic parts of the controller are dramatic. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error messages, SMART cannot terminate this error. some of SMART specified error messages. this is especially Lesefehler and publishing counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power if you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be produced without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices power supply does not make a lot of power, these anomalies can cause these anomalies, complete data loss, hardwarms, motherboards, and other defects. protect themselves in front of the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power tips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed by a part of the energy heat and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug bar. remember that not any connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that it guarantees the UL 1449 standard. this ensures that he offers protection against lightning and thus protects the right connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage can use any cable to your computer, you should also be aware that all the peripherals can also be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide a phone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overload protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system is used in front of smaller variations in the current lines. even a few seconds can lead you to the loss of adverse data. it can be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically set up rechargeable battery power. however, some models allow you to save up to the current. if you have a USV, you should be sure that they might get the same quality requirements such as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to avoid your computer system and compare his safety at electricity disorders with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think so that you should always keep all cables about trenne before you travel into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store your amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives, but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB, and you will not get your images in full resolution. the professional version will you get more available, in case of flickr. for $25 a year you will get unlimited memory, which should be reviewed only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the viewpoint of data backup are the Web solutions very secure. transmission error will automatically include a backup and a partial memory in the offer. so they are Desasterproof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in computer. all transfers are due for transmission error. filesystem zfs and btrfs adjust at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst is that no one has occurred if a data transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection in your computer. no one seems to have no protection. no one seems to have thought to have. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently affected by transmission problems you should look at the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL Incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows released. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses the zfs and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">These two factors are not underestimate! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% at workplace systems. if notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the chisels. it is limited to a lower damage, e.g. theft or reinstallations. it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users are only very few viruses and under & Linux; it has been no longer sung.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less expensive for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the trial process during one operation is higher and a definitive status is avoided. if a file is not completely saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders. it is meant that the technology is further developed for this progress. sensitivity and roughness to all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go up to the 10 megapixels sensors. even if this resolution is already deteriorated for compact cameras and the end result. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high quality optics are rather deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-size sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive is responsible for 100 & euro; so you do not have any other data loss for data loss. thus secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash beats you lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally, and destroys a lot. forget airplane accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desertion is always a non-local storage. bring your sickle up the stairs to enter into the neighboring house in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above already is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are secured to be secured. it is a moment without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: one backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. this creates a complete moment up to two time points: the complete backup and the final differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. you can produce the original status in any time. this backup comes to a versioning system at the next with the exception that it is only abgeted and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily setup your machines. in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transferring encoding rsync is only the difference of the files that were really changed. this happens if you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure your important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach gives you enough time to discover losses and again. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment for every month. each additional thinner should be done manually after which you have a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, associated with XMP files, associated XMP files, original keep, memory, scalability, media, refind pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To survive valuable pictures for the next 40 years, it is about the time span in which you really interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unpredictable because of your nature is unpredictable and evaluate it all today. unfortunately, there is no other way to do so. all 5-8 years should ask oneself like the current system backward. if less variants you have used in the past, so it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for any use. if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, then store it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time when you can change your computer architecture, your memory and backing technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the trade pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means always enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us go from which you have the scalability with which you have set the scalability with a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this section to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check out with the command dmesg whether your new record is detected by the system, but do not hang them up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / SDC & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MB2,3, FAT16, 32 and travel FS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / shc1 # change the size of travel FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no software you can read, then you can create this yourself. this task is easier by year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that vanishes slowly from the market. therefore you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was created as an open source standard which should replace GIF. it can be much more. it is loss free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata. the disadvantage is that there is relative many administration information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format would you like to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread as picture format. TIFF can store images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can save your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted for many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open raw processing format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the need of camera data formats. a handfully camera manufacturer is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace the & quot; extensions of the 90's. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information are allowed to enter into a file itself. the file information can be stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers leave it in front of a original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, the metadata stores separately from the file format. however, it can be found to use problems with linking between the metadatendatei and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that support a wide range of applications and business models. to the activities of DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and transfigured efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadatewards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures can use on the camera, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a sensitive processing, you can use external programs. if you add the pictures again with & digiplug; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined pictures for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleries, code you in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; in paragraph add a description how you can already add photos you can already add on your hard disk. the camera interface provides you but many advanced settings for importing pictures to your album bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect these with the computer, turn the camera to display mode and switch it. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, this is trying to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a distance of any photos can be displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file extension for any file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information on each entry. you can see the features of the camera and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a single entry and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file characteristics and the photo information connected to the camera. a symbol shows that the picture has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer remarks, GPS etc. these information are the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digiplug; or image processing. note that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click here to download and then choose from all. these invites all photos from their camera to a single album and we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to download in a album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos you can only download the desired using the standard selection methods of & kde; select the button to download and then selected file. the button selected is long as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a option is available for download. these pictures have been selected now until now. in this case, the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance window. if you select this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the buttons to download or selected file, a dialog appears to be stored on the photos. the list of existing albums will be sorted as normal folder. details on the folder you can read in section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the button. if you want to delete all the button, you must select this first and delete them to delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera. they should not be deleted by the camera. if you want to delete the photos successfully into a & digiplug; if you want to delete the photos successfully in a & digiplug; if you want to delete the camera if you want to delete the camera option, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos often do not have any meaningful names. this may lead to double filename, if you have taken photos of different recording series into the same album. therefore it can be meaningful, the date and time to integrate the picture in which the image has been added to the file names.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors on the image and for data-based underlines. if you use this latter option, will automatically be created a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three further options that will be performed before the photos on the board. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another file format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-%% H:% M:% S. switch the date & time to use. for more customization you should read the help of the command time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you have the option to change the file names in small letters. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiplug; for a photo is displayed below the name, the camera is displayed in the preview. your settings are stored and automatically used when you can open the camera for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can do all information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during the download. do not all cameras provide this information. in the section side bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has been embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is normally enabled, and when your camera does not deliver this information, the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatically, use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera was done on which the picture has been made available, and digiplug; this subalds are based on the image album. all images with the same date are loaded on the same lower album. do not all cameras provide this information. in the section side bar Meta Data, you can read what information can be embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case stores & digiplug; the photos directly to the target album. if you want to change this option. use the button Extended and select there the date-based understandings at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their computer to her camera is button to download. choose the file selection dialog & kde; it appears where you can select the files that can be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you'll ask where the images should be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera. choose the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position in length and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place. not everyone uses a plane to play an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agencies can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot to have exactly the photo, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want a postcard to another & digiplug; users want to localize the place of the photos, or simply want to document the position of the photos, it is good to add the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a follow-up of GPS data and image files to the geographical assignment (manual) and last about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera which has integrated GPS unit. but there is a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>

<seg id="295">Over- and overexposed areas of a picture can be selected with dark or bright colour in the picture. these colours are specified here. in the image processing can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling, it is meant that the images can be encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setup of PNG, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation reduces the image quality, since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file compressed, you can switch the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF-pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not reduce the size of the TIFF images. it does not have influence on the image quality as the deflate algorithm loss.</seg>

<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug; the image processing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently, it develops very fast to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, this difference is a little bit slower than the image. this option is a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 Gitterpattern with VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white image is used as the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white is not set. standard is it a fixed colour balance that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that the overexposed images added more details in four steps. for other cameras this option will ignore this option.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top speed, so the parts of your images are captive to view the setting-in white in the settings. you can also use the setting through some unusual results since they can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the contenders.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general can't be satisfied as fast as green and red. & digiw should therefore try the missing green and red shares that are not yet designed to reconstruct blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you will get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value to your taste. you need to set it slightly higher than the default 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digiplug; this can also be done later in order to keep the time for the demo version, you should keep conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosadem algorithm is a digital image process to add a complete picture from the partial color data that presents many cameras and the Matrix colour pixels is well known. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and dcrab provide you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcrav. it is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color soft of your lentils, you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, since you will be carried out during the raw material.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and are instructions as to be given back. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information like the color information from a colour space to the other, so the colors are as exactly as possible.</seg>

<seg id="317">The input profiles should be able to use the camera manufacturer and model you can fit. do not contain all profiles are produced on the same type. currently, dcraw Gamma does not need for conversions at 16 bits depth. this means that you need to perform the paint tongs itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the soft-proof-profile, which you can emulate picture, as your printer can print a smaller color range as your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated. this could manually correct instead of the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that the colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. therefore, a table of cameras and profiles can be fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style of the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Portraitand S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface, supported by a number of & kde; image processing and image processing is supported; many modules support which have been written to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. if you want to use & digiplug; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and also in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the advance.</seg>
<seg id="323">Dumbbell for tasks that are conducted by modules can be set up in the menu under the settings.</seg>

<seg id="337">& digiplug; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and to correction and improvement. image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; so they are not part of your distribution. for further information about the KIPI modules can be found in section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the lower edge of the window, the filename, current record number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. no the functions will change the original photo, before using file saving or the button Save from the tool bar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should get a copy of your image before you change it. you can Save with file Save as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by removing the image processing in the toolbar. you lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be made and re-manufactured or recovered. the last action can be restructured or re-manufactured, using editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the scanning shorter, Ctrl; -z to the reverse and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; you can press a context menu on the back or restore button in the tool bar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all promotions are made between also and recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or same keyword by using the navigation system in the tool bar, image, below or the entries in the menu file. if you have any changes in the current photo you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo in and out of zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse bike or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the safest menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the Esc button. if you don't want to use this toolbar. if you don't want to change this in the setup dialog. you can view this in the setup dialog; see the section to setup the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image file and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or full sentences. you need to select images with the standard methods and select from the menu album exporting printing assistant. if you follow the assistant, you will need only to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a side bar at the right edge that is important information and actions available for the selected pictures. the same side bar is available without the navigation system, even in the image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders will be clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider, the side bar will appear or disappear in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling of view you can enter or insert the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are formed after 2000 characters and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented on, you will either use the button users or switch to the next picture, the labelling will be stored then.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata of the selected file or the database. but this will always be done if you choose a metadata setting that is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the scanning shorter Ctrl + 0... 5. the rating from the sidebar is always applied on a picture. to rate several pictures at the same time, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written into the IPTC field error. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box for the words of the keywords, the keyword-tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digiplug; session requested words.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword-tree is adjusted dynamically to the appropriate search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief at the input of samples in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keyword may also be placed by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of a picture are stored into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If more images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the section Keyword filters.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar code filter is used to change the selection of the displayed window with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search views. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the quantity quantity of these two are displayed. all created words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also touch keywords and lay them. suppose you have several images selected to drag you with keyword. if the keyword exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears to ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on one calendar day. the keyword means that the amount is selected on three pictures. they were selected with Strg + a, and afterwards it was filed a keyword out of the right keyword. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. you can also be switched on settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it would be one or to be, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the rules range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the record, after which is sought in the database. this may be a album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a further search about all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button. then see the options as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why one of your camera or scanner is based on a predictable deviation from the most of your camera or scanners, you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners, and that you can print the colors or in the web, which comply with your digital dark Chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic is coming on color management, then everyone knows what buttons is to express. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with any point of image processing. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informational decisions to make you the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image processing all listed below the criteria listed below, then you must not take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You can work on a monitor that is calibrated on the RGB colour space. (more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are per e-mail or the web, where the RGB of the de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if so RGB is so good and life for all so easy, why should you use another color space to make a different color space, so that you need to make a color noise?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limiting from sRGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufearenical region, and the colors in the RGB Farspace, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour flowers, you are visiting Bruce Lindblooms side and then click on info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to allocate my monitor, if I decided to work in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the RGB colour space or not, you have to get your monitor kallibriert. if you work as in the color space of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the RGB standard kallibrim, a passable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases. use it therefore before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, equal, Automatic and contrast extend from the menu correct Automatic correction automatically to make your colors the best. they are experimenting with these effects, to see what works best at your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled through the entire image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its colours. this function is often an Magical correction for images the dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same method: this method is adjusted to the LEDs of the selected image, so that the histogram of the selected image is so flat as possible. in this way, there is a very good results in the improvement of a picture, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful surgery which causes either miracle in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blueprint. it determines the dark and bright boundaries and adjust the red, green and blukanäle to the complete histolicences.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast expand: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by the one's lowest and highest values on the maximum possible range and a new jireation of all values. this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white edge of & digiplug; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white drain of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The White-equal correction is a bit limited by a color space with 8-bit per color. if you can perform a color space with overload exposure. if you are working with overload exposure. if you are working with overload exposure. if you work in the white mode, your possibilities will be able to get better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white equivalent algorithm to copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. it is starting with the menu entry colors white equal to image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of tool. if you want to see the original whitance, then it is enough to click the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram, once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, most pixel very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum will be called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and Gamma. the shadows can be improved or down the shadow of your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls are used, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and afterwards somewhere on the picture to use the color temperature of the white equivalent. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indicators increases the colors if more than one colour channel of the Pixels are overexposed.. you will display the combined result in white image. this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and load make it exactly this. each setting of the white equalies you can now save in a text file and later load it again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button prescriptions sets all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white equivalent. note that even neutral settings can be set to another photo as your original. if you want to save this original image.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the machined picture. 8-bit coding is better for high quality images. this coding is also required for high quality images. this coding is also required for high quality images. these coding are also required for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tension can be done by the base window for the use of color profiles, you can draw the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu of colors. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make you the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for pitch correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure problems to correct is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; Tool Farbeffective provides you four colour effects, a Velvia filter, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also Sabatier, a effect of the picture was completed. this was the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were completed by the second lighting. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controlled the solar panel. at approx. 50% intensity shows the image which is chemically possible. a further increase will finally generate a negative image that is so not to produce on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and smooth. try it easy, it embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors with daylight and high contrasts. Velvia provides great saturated colors, but also some photographs, especially those who are barely sceneries, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repetitions. in large pictures, the filter can reload the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you can try the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos. all your adjustment can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, you can use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo of bad light conditions, you can get a good choice for brightness. even in this case the tool is a good choice for saturation. all changes you can perform in preview. if Him don't like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchment / contrast / Gamma / Gamma is the tool to improve the exposure. also if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of the slider. specifically the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity values, histogram, the active channel or the selected section. under the graphite, three slums are exposed to the image and the left side represents the dark side and the right side represents the light areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and change it on the same as the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically, using the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is often displayed. for pictures of a digital camera, linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top for the dark tones, the medium for bright tones, and the lowest for medium tones, frequently gammavalues called.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pin pettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shade, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the choice of manual values for each range. there are also two knob, the output values can be interactive as with the input values. the compression of the output values can be used, for example, the compression values can be used as background, while something else can be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button will automatically set the picture values automatically depending on intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and store: using these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and later reloaded later. it is used to use the Gimp level format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use these mode and the three shades, the input values will automatically be adjusted automatically for all shadows, medium and sunshine, click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histo, green, blueprints and luminosity.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposed indicators will receive all kinds of color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you will get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of alignment the input values applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left-hand side, half of the originals and the target image is displayed. the preview will be dynamic in dependence of your settings. on the right side are the following options available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are changing between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures featuring a digital camera, linear mode has produced a wide beam. in this case, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curator according to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that this bright tones can be correspondent and corresponding to the associated image pixel.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red marking is visible. if you want to change this marking on the curve, a matching line is shown on the curve which is the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off, until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and store: using these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve can be stored in the file system and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp course format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to use this method and the three color petals automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sunshine. activate the color pipette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the rotor, green, blueprint and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposed indicators will display all kinds of color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will get the combined result. this is, that you can only see the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sunshine was applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is a further developed tool to mix the colour shades of the images. you can process it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can choose the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels. the left area of the window shows you a preview of the original can be viewed for comparison via the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you see this in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram will show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels as if you also enable the option of Monochrome, since the channel mixer is used to create a great black-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you come to monochrome, the reduction of a colour comes with a visible noise that looks at the same place in the colour channel and their cracks in each channel. if this is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion, which allows you to reduce the farthing.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and charging buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any blender adjustment allows you to save and then load the file format is the Gimp channel format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposed indicators will receive all kinds of color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you will get the effect just in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in the blue channel. the Luminanz option is enabled. the original image is below (1) and this picture has been shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / White photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step, since colour pictures can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / W film-exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good for all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / W film-exposure with a orange link filter. this improved landscapes, marine scenes and air photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orangefilters.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / W movie exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate moon light for the day of time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / W movie exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces hot bright and medium tones during a bit cold in the shattage. this is very similar to the procedure of a pressure and redevelopment in a seiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; tool texture can use decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like a painting of an old master, a pop kind of portrait from enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right to the right to the depth or three dimensional stability of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been used on the picture below. the original image is (1) and changed under (2). the relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Add the & digiplug; the tool can add a decorative frame to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer's eye to keep in the borders of a photos is not easy to maintain its attention. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. under picture frame the module can be started under image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you can adjust the desired frame type for your image. through a large line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), it is ideal for a nice three-dimensional effect and decoratively add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: the width of the frame is in percent. the range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original, but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool for aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple to insert text in a picture on any spot. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. enter the text, orientation, color from the color space and character set with its properties like you need. if you want to adjust the drawing size of the image size. at the end you can simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed, up to the button "OK". after the image has been saved once, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; mould template, you can apply a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture Stones use template in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For stencil there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. you need to add to the size of the file size of the template. if you want to add your stencil and digiplug; send an e-mail in English to the & digiplug; mailinglist digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool to use this tool, you need to set your templates folder with the button Base folder. select here the folder you have to copy the template files. this settings are indicated for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the templates has been placed a building view which automatically reflects the folder of the template's structure. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and change the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the darunderlying picture. it is centered to the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resized: this knob resized among them the lying image. if you want to use the position of the mouse. if you want to use the template on the whole picture, you need to reduce the picture to the left. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and lay it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the stencil onto your image. the image will then be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; three different tools are available for sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Imsharpic mask works on the contrast of the edges to look back a picture. actually it is no bit slower, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to play atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Reproduction is possibly the best of the three because it really improved the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images require a correction of sharpness. elements the smaller than the resolution must be printed, so that the same phenomenon can be printed on paper. SLR cameras does not need to be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures often an camera has been used for internal sharpening. pictures in the raw format is always to be used during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a sharpense filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this deactivate, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value. this allows you to correct the sharpening sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">This should be careful however, because the results are not very natural, the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, you can easily adjust the tool to control the tool. under realism, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisy. the solution to correct the image is much easier than sharpening. use the tool to sofar sofar and experimenting with the menu. the presentation window on the right side of the dialog indicates you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred is a very good tool to remove the veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help the picture. the presentation window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate good results and should be tried first. an increasing radius or amount should be tried. if you make the imsharpic mask to make a noise, and generate the impression of tombs in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius indicates how many pixels on each side of a ridge is affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore sharpen images in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignorant image, which is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and to the apply differential amount. one can define a minimum difference to the edge of the filters. this way, areas with a soft change between the killing of sharpening and therefore beauty defect shall be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and that worked picture (2). blurred painting was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; the tool refocus on a painting by improving the sharpness. it used to be protected by copyright by copyright protected by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to drive a picture to & quot; it's better approach as to try the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienness. it uses usually better results as unsharp masked. you can start it out of the menu by pressing colors editing in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular saw is much better than the Gauge's barrel. the Gauge has a very long tail, which leads far from the original quellum, which is far influenced by the original quellum. the FIR Views is influenced in most cases, which causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be extremely blurred, but if your image should be extremely blurred.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation was reduced the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the space filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is helpful. however, 0 is very bad. if the noise filter is very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value is still very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter to avoid unsharply filter. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arteas. if you have a value unequal zero, you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizensize: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. however, please note that module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and charging buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameter which you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all of the cut, color and intensity correction on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you can change the picture elsewhere. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not visible immediately, but that later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, eg. JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masked better results as sharpening. this could be caused by a greater neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to produce insharp mask. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the impetitions. for the Viennese Filter, it is always the result of the FIR Viennese Filters always just as well as the imsharpic mask. the FIR Viennese Filter is often better than the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp paint image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to unenough light to the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpecortion in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob of the controller puts the sharpness of the area in order to generate a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want to adjust blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool-error correction is one of the most frequently developed tool to remove the artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inner algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as Starpoints to simplify restoration. the available presets are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the riders and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass over the image. what to obtain greater values mainly homogeneous regions and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be found that no sharpenalties is necessary. please note that there should be a sharpensive disorder always.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional alpha [0,100]: a small value of smooth evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film graven, or CCD smoke will produce a high value of wishable pattern. JPEG Artefakte will be removed best at a value nearby 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value as a degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is necessary, the more is required if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm will pass through. usually lasts 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle measurer da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, it should also be small. note that small angle should generate a long runtime. you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel glasses and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more about quality that you can get through the choice of this option is only low. it doubles the running time. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and load make it exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be stored into a text file and later be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correct is comparatively very fast when working. but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image error with little artefacts. the module is used in a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is an independent black artifacts during the journey caused by a bad film storage during the journey. (1) to see and correct image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; smoking production is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a protected protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to come to the spot and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor smokers from the camera or Moireins; effects from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor smokers of digital cameras, you can read it in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a gracking space that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the subwindow details and the lower advanced settings can remain at the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the windows size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can be adjusted the image below the picture and the color in it is smoother and thus smaller bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch of the filter to the front is to be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image data may not get more and cradle or smashing it again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, it cannot occur at a value of the maximum, if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artifacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either a colour or luminance to improve a picture. this settings does not affect the application process by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either a colour or luminance to improve a picture. this settings does not affect the application process by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that are typically stronger, however, it is contaminated too.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phasenjittering. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges will appear. if he is on his minimum, noise and phasenjitter may appear to edges. he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for smokers that you have set, can be saved in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and correct with (2) and the smokers was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisy for your purpose. this solution, the image is a bit soft to draw, fortunately it is much easier than a painting with the menu entry correct and experimenting with the gluten. the presentation window on the right side of the dialog indicates the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; photo restration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photojournalist.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility of removing undesirable artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to immerse yourself in digital, original or subsequently digitalised images into digital, original or subsequently digitalised images. the smoother is made along the image contours and makes it the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textured pixels. the algorithm is developed using another tool, the image error correction, developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Franningen and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas, it produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and load make it exactly this. any adjustment of photo restration may hereby be stored into a text file and later be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restration is comparatively very fast when working. but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce how to reduce a photo with equal noise. the module is applied on a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the notorious film grains on the faces. the original image is under (1) and correct under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see a further example of the photo restration. this time, textures can be reduced to an old color photo, which was compiled with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts from the Scannerillumination and photopapier. the original image is visible under (1) and correct image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tools Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel of photos that were built with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickens.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially suitable for high-quality raw mode photos, since many cameras with JPEG compression has a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the assistant with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to the correct image. please note that the assistant will notice the last darkeness and automatically load this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture range and the preview can help you correct within the picture. the presentation window shows the output of the filtering with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the felt. choose the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirst: it is determined an average of the neighboring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for 1-dimensional interpolation, this is used separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of pixel block will be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block is pulled to a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all Pixel with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a colour photo, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct image is visible under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiplug; vignettibility correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. interrupted corners, a picture to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can't be evenly spread the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they reach the corners and edges of the image by adding the light to the sensor. Teleobjective show under conditions also show this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he has also disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at aperture filters, which should be impossible with hand. wide angle lens should also be able to use with Center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise imsharply effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filtration and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by simulating the effect of a Centerfilter. the tool contains vignettification correction, the tool is protected by a centerfilter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulations you can control the Vignettification correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light-amplification at the point of the largest density. the standard density is 2.0, what a optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 1, or randomly to compensate the density to compensate a greater degree of vignetting. reduce it by a small degree of compression.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukstrength, contrast and Gamma settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignettification correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. you need only increase positive values, as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine tuning of the exposure of the target image, so let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettifier correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct image. a leukinske- and contrast correction was also performed in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar rounded effect, flattened to the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of Grades corrects the distant edges opposite to the second degree. if you combine these two different geometric distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally, this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tonnage can be corrected and positive values are kisfied distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the distortion. this value is stronger than change than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter has the remark of the parameter in General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and leads through a correction of first grades. negative values increase during positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value is adjusted in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you help the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview of distorted correction. values for your image are saved and using the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or kissenic correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes. best, you perform this correction as all first through. if you need a painting and carry out a tonnage correction would be the effect of the effect of the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you help the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot. in the connection you can correct the tonnage / kissenic distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct the resulting image of black corners. you can remove these with the trimming tool in the menu transformers, remove from the image processing or through the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonnage is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs like e.g. recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective so correct to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees. please note that if you keep the camera with hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnage-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GennGuru.org website that is based on this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IInfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can choose the range for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters set film grains and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO knob changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter canals for reproduce infrared film, particularly the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the color information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter format on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and this image has been shown below (1) and the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of Aura in the setting.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter film graven is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the films and mixing large silver grains of the photemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems back to the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere loosed from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photographic view, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, then you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film grains to a black / W image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulator to influence this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five. thickly brushes are suitable for large images. smoothing controls the glass or, from the other side are considered the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the paper is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large image is 1 and Glue 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity ministered to create a carboneskizze. they are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you choose what scene would have chosen you to scarize you. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a range of values from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (glass).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and changed picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can still be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving your image in 3-D when it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to give up your images with a 3-D effect. it works very good at pictures with a simple structure, where color does not use the most important part of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey scenery.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example for the engraving filter. the original (1) and the original image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by using a distortion effects. it uses protected algorithms of pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: share the picture in cells and will look like whether it is characterized by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogously to the shaft blocks 1, the image will be distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work with imsharpic effects. it uses protected algorithms of pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Imsharpness: ignorant the image along the steep lines out of a central point. this simulates the imsharpic camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radical imsharpness: ignorant the image by rotation of the pixel by a central point. this simulates the imsharpation of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: ignorant the image around the effect of a non-focused camera. the object seems back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharpness: ignorant the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the imsharpness of a linear move, z: B: from a car or train to photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Turnable imsharpness: ignorant the picture soft in dark and strong in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, Glamour-photos or add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelunsharpness: ignorant the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the imsharpation of a arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpness: finds the paddling pool in the image and ignorant these without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it through the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raisropes are a nice little tool to make Regulropes on your image. this makes it natural your images a nighty look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows to change the size of the tropics. since the tropic size is not automatically reduced with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish stock changes the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use & digiplug; image processing a range from Regropropes. use the range of tool to choose the area, e.g. a vision that should stay free. if you start the filter, the range will stay free of shelves.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regulators Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the working image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the picture has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformations turning or with spike.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A painting is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture when the limits of dissolution can be found? how can you find the missing information? how can you find the missing information? how can you find the missing information? how can you see the missing information here? how can you see the missing information here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo set the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformable size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog box is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool can change a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Splins Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug; used a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider Neue Size and are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio should be retained: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original size will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is necessary, the more is required if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and load will be used exactly. each insertion for photo can be stored as text file and later be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo shooting is very fast when it makes, but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo shooting by clicking a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a common operation, but also an frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse, using the mouse button and drag the rectangle, you will see this rectangle with your mouse while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. this allows you to change the size of the right. you can draw the size of the rectangle, by removing the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button closure button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or file Save under the menu to save the newly created photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preset area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio will be defined in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool for aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or transverse format. in high format, the larger value of the height and the transverse format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool can be cut into the aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal to whether you use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog box you can use the Max. ratio knob the range for cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool then cut the tool according to aspect ratio (Horizontal or vertical). if you are using the cutting tool, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will be reflected in the picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compositions enable you to blending your pictures even better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are designed to divide a rectangle in similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mid: the golden middle is a split which is based on different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of the Nautilus shell or the blossom leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the error number 1,618033988... and it was used to build your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you use your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number runs from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to 1: 1.618 the golden middle. one composition measures this rule is considered visual harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides liquid aid lines when you create a picture. this help is drawn down below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third party, the golden spiral line creates a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden spiral. it should be something that the eye can be in the heart of the composition. it can be a line with or different objects. this something can be simply because his eye to lead, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also guide the top points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can be a static object of dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles around your frame, create a effect of professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonious part.</seg>
<seg id="660">Using button colour you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this type can adjust the color of the lines your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easy to adjust the camera to exactly vertical or horizontally. you can manually repair this with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool-free rotation. choose the transformer and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. by default the slider can be set to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help you make the module free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview for both lines. after you fix it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair it is the function transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatic. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-aliasing option captures a bit after the rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perimeter transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the center of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will be re-calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas which are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas which are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left bottom: displays the current angle in degrees to the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little bit dirty. for a single adaptation is this effect small, but two adjustments generate a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After completing the perspective, you can get inable triangular holes on the corners. a possibility to cover it is the picture with transformation cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The mould tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the lower part into the opposite. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. with other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press preferences, the angle is set to zero. a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed on you and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the mold tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the picture, the image becomes a bit annoying. for a single shot, this effect is usually neglegible, but two deposits generated twice as much as you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. an option to eliminate it is the picture with transformation into the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats, therefore from your system and, in some cases, from the way how these libraries have been compilated. in most distributions you can process a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system file formats, but they will always be JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digiplug; shows only files in formats to know. this is done by the file extension and a comparison of these with a predefined list. if the file extension is displayed in the list. you can change this list of file extensions and digiplug; in the section configuration you can find further information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select to select the format. a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general there are better, smoother results as JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also be saved if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw format, you can read in Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw processing of & digiplug. in the section configuration you can find information about the use of modules with & digiplug;.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digiplug; supports the shop of raw materials only with the program dcraw, which is used in & digiplug; all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw materials used by & digiplug; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording of short films. these clips are frequently stored in Avio or MPEG format; but it is not possible to display movies. & digiplug; but when you click on a movie file & digiplug; the & kde; settings for playback of movies are used to start the program for playback.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization is available to localise images geographically in the spherical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlated your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsyou can download the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can lead a number of images selected with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Choose the pictures you want to correlated in the main window and call the menu on. the above-looking dialog appears to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains of course data that have been taken at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded in red, the coordinates is performed in red. GPS trace data will be recorded in GMT-time and therefore, the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The settings for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. the deviation from among them will be summarised. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have any trace data from a place for pictures you can edit the GPX file and add to the pictures. the time difference between 2000 seconds will then correlated all images in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options of interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no appropriate data. if you know that in reality a local difference between camera and GPS, you can set this boundaries here and then press the button correlated to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog box to use the coordinates of a call to the next page you need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the shown card and enlarge it. select the appropriate region and enlarge it again. the height must always be selected manually. the card can always be selected between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely beyond the KIPI module there are options to hang up the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module photo gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will be UTF-8 encoded in order to achieve the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to the settings. the albums are not allowed to select this albums. with the three buttons on the right side you can select a large number of albums. in the area, the Albenpreview and the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side. this rider is largely self explained. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in the picture. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; KuickShow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and as the gallery with all your corresponding images should be stored. select a folder where you have a folder named KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth you can change the standard colour depth. this is naturally also the file size. all other settings are explained even.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider demonstration pictures allows you to see some of the settings from the album Rider for the presentation pictures, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user to how far the action is. press the process to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module generates the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs to determine whether the web browser is started automatically at the end to display the preview of the gallery. press Close down the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and use them basic operations like filings, zooming or shifting. it was designed for fast image display and fast access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this may be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Verdon-free module is a tool to alter pictures without any quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store images in JPEG format, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is to be the file size, because there is no compression of the colour information. this takes place in the PNG format as well.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">Currently no documentation is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI Teams under kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata Editor has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailinglist kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI teams.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import of metadata moduls you can copy data from a picture to another copy. then select the file selection dialog where you can copy the file selection dialog, so the image will be copied to which you have to copy the metadata. the data will be copied to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can write from anywhere but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please look exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodifier module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic format between the individual images. you can also add a audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slides.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can choose the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. for burning the media you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that will be packed into MPEG Diaschau. then you can start the module via extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. if you're using the video format, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD file, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds which is indicated in seconds. a lower value is generated, very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt, you should leave it black. the name and the path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file. keep you as possible if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file using the name of the audio source file, then you can start downloading the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee or drink all the rest of a coffee and enjoy the slides back when you return back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that costing or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows you to print several images on a paper sheet together in standard Photosizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is useful to improve it or print using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your data stored in the RAW format stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original size of Him is: expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcrap better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First choose the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw image conversion window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the convergent process. the first option decides, whether the camera settings can be used in white or blue. if the result is not optimal, if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and storing the conversion speed. the file name remains equal to and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a reliable algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image format, TIFF, reserves the information of your image and uses the loss-free LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you want to edit your pictures frequently, or later, you should not use the JPEG format, since there are only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG format, the metadata are stored in the RAW file, in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, you can break down this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time. use this mode if you're safe, e.g. by testing on a single picture that are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, this is helpful if they have produced this in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in a album. it uses the program convert from the image Magick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of a album. you can use the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the time.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the image Magick package. you can download the image or enlarge it. 4 types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional scale change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-preparation: prepare the picture for the photo print. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of photopapiers. the target image, including background size, edge size and background colour is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected images with your preferred E-mail program. it is possible to change the size of the most important pictures before. more images can be put on the list of the pictures and lay down there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the picture window will be displayed by you selected pictures. over the button pictures you can add further pictures with a file selection dialog. for the last image, a preview will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also go to the picture list and add the list to add images to the list.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures, the selected pictures from the list is removed too.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all images, you can open the new message -window of your e-mail clients. you'll need to add the addresses and the subject. you have already joined the selected pictures as Appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure to send many pictures on one time. most E-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the settings for the sending of the images. your configuration is stored and once again used until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, you'll need to specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you'll need to install the GMailAgent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting the comments in an attached file the comments are added to the images into a text file and add the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and not to change the photo quality. otherwise we recommend to JPEG format.</seg>

<seg id="917">& kad album; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures. integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user book, the integrated version is described in & kad album; integrated version that you can create using the HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and objective. in the following each section will be more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the transfer and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kad album; HTML-example page, you see an example for this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you can choose whether a & crankalbum; -export file is to be created on the oversight page. to find information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. for example, please note that all pictures of a party are obvious. note that all pictures exported from a party. you can't use this setting, therefore you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can define how the HTML page should look like the HTML page. most influential possibilities are unique, which is not specially developed.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can view different resolutions for the images. this allows those to consider your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures for example, which have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewing of your site can change the resolution at any time. it can therefore lead your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he want to see a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, insert the different folder and the URL to be stored where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a basic folder for all your HTML files, and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where you will be stored in all your images. this folder will be stored and select at the next time. this folder allows you to select either a folder or one from KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check whether these are really all for viewing. if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL that you should be created here should be this folder. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created you are not yet in the final target file, you need to copy them manually. this is not the final goal of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The only described options have been related to basic file or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name can set you in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images. if you're already looking for a lot of time, the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to make this work yet once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & collaborative album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can also import other in your database. the image teams are removed with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim-files, internal and external. they distinguish whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether the images can be stored in the file or whether you can collect all images into the file, and this file can be so independent. the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can choose a .kim file either directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the pictures that are not found in the file of .kim file. if the pictures are not found, the pictures of the URL will be searched for creating HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML import.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting pictures describes you to exporting over the menu file exporting...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should act internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option Manually to copy the .kin file, you'll need to copy the images into the same folder as the .kim-file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically in the .kim-file, copy & kboot album; the images are automatically set for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it normally doesn't want to compress the files. if you want to compress this, simply select the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you don't send the images in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can say the size limit as you can say that each picture should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the Encounter .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select, will import & kAudio album; exported database as described in described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing consists of four steps. first you need to import what pictures you want to import, then in which folder you want to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are called the category of the category of imported file, while this category is called for your database people. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be imported into the third dialog window, which are to be imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can choose the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. one example will see you on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and look at: if you see pictures you want to view images often within different picture groups & mdash; if you want to view images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your boyfriend you would like to see all images, on which this friend see is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the different steps from (1) to put the information on your pictures, above (2) to search and see, up to (3) advanced topics and adapting possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been extended and today also cares your videos. at many places in this manual will have spoken about pictures, but often it also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kad album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale backup tools, copy to a diskette or revisions in the CVS.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kad album; indicated the folder where your paintings are stored and use this with future Starts. if you want to start another folder with pictures, you can start & kboot album; using option -c. as an example: kfinished album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings for your album; you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kboot album; modify the different setup possibilities to be explained in the following section of the user book.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can contact the preview possibilities of preview and options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how you can define various features such as people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog box which is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog box options you can submit complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a mediator as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">You can see the setup possibilities to provide you to the list of membership groups. you can select the category. in the left window, you can select a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& killer Album; share his modular system with other graphic applications such as digiplug and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface. can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can not be described in this manual because they are not part of & kready album; but most of the modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications can be used together, it can test that the modules have tested with & crankalbum; therefore you should try to call new modules at first time with the command &gt; keling album -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't say, I don't have to warned it!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use modules via KIPI, are very different, making it possible to work some modules with & crankalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The greatest difference between & kest album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply plugged in albums: this type of order is not supported, simulates the order for some modules the order to albums that you can use the functions with & kboot album;</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kful album; the current album, which is easy to see the current view, so all the images that shows you the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & killer album; the modules can also be handed over to a list of albums. here, the current album will be presented here:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kiss album; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category as category for virtual albums, used as a category for virtual albums. if so, if you are using the category for example, if you are selected, if you have selected people to view and pass this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kad album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the range modules that modules can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a starting screen once you can start & kiss album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you've been used by any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you can see your picture database. currently, we don't have any information about your pictures. in the section we will be back on this window, then click on the record images that shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kad album; is the possibility to see each picture with notes. this includes information about the people who set up on the picture. you can set each picture either by either or for a larger number of images specific remarks. if you have shown on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures in Copenhagen were taken.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments may be used for searching and browser, as you can read in the section. if you want to see this comments if you want to use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by using persons, places and passwords. these are a very important part of & kready album; since you will always use it again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the shift of the pictures based on the list: if you are shown for example a family party and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons can be moved, so that the names are moved to above, which can find people faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to view an illiterated list, click on the symbol for sorting to date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture, you might want to edit any selected pictures and have this picture with remarks. click in this case simply click on the right and back buttons that are located under the preview of the picture above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, for example using the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark this images and use the menu item added to one note once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all available in the USA. Moreover, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a special rate is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In context menu of the announcements dialogs it is possible to add one entry to a existing or subcategory. in addition, you can also take one entry to a category and place there to make this entry into a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes that you are just illiterate your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have a scene, you can renders them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to renders, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renders the current scene, click the Symbol Renders icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">One Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the renders. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can attach any number of Render modes, from a quick preview of up to full images in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click the symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu View Viewing modes... select the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can only enter any name, but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the cartel map size you can select the width and height of the rounded image. if you want only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and give the image section to the renders into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the features that uses & Povray; it is used by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the table properties can be found in the usandbuch & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a painting with only one beam per pixel you can create different errors. these pictures often have a Moirè patterns or stud effects in curves and lines, and sometimes more details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. in general, pictures are better seen with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn off anti-aliasing, calculates & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is getting further split and adaptive because the records of the calculated colour values depend on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray has a beam of pixels, then both pixels are processed by the persecution of a particular additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each. if the difference is shared between the colour values, then the pixels will be split into 4 sub-pixel, which can be evaluated individually and further evaluated on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is reducing the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflectance. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust if the alpha channels are calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high quality assurance for extended projections, all projections are using a expanded projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>

<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify the existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window orders will be explained, as you can save windows and save.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window Regulations: shows all existing windows. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order to the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of the shutters shows all existing windows. a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order. new views can add to the button and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with inquiries you will get the window under the existing window, with cartoning card, you will not get the view on the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to follow without more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all the steps in this guide, you should make the ultimate scene easy to create, under beginnings: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should make the following warning carefully, before you complain about it, before you get a result of a black screen. if you use a 3D program to the first time you should see these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set the camera, no rules can be applied for the Renders, as a result you will get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert a light sources, your entire scene in the dark and you will only receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything you have installed, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation that you can get an appropriate presentation what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will now use these menus and symbols now, therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. therefore you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene to create. in particular, note the scene from the fourth wire model (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the outcome of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click to view the contents of the view object properties, where the different parameters of the camera will be found in the user documentation & Povray; please find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but you can change the camera in the view control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and draw him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button user or the input field, change the wire model views and the object-tree immediately accordingly to these settings. as a result, they look at the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene. you might set a quantader (insert and insert the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a permanent method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or the input paste. in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view is now also the plane when even at the moment only as a limited level. if you renders the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you can view the object tree, you will find that you can find the entry for the ground. in this case you will find the different parameters of object. in this case you will find only the options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line, just to know some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just select the floor to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select how the object is added to the object. please choose the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments shows a mat black material because you need to check out the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. give now the colors for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities now, but do you now take the easiest ways.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see in the preview no colour on Quader and ball, click the button user and call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is right now. if you want your image now with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the colour display. you need to enter two new attributes. in the colour list you need to do two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this entry, but the playboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you easily run, as you have already understood the basic work of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as simple as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can change the settings. use the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget to push the input or the button user), that the ball should be boiled with the ground. otherwise you would have moved the ground around a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the renders now gives a selfames result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a mat black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now choose a material now. as in the ground, enter the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">First, select initial object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, select then insert and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on user or press the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of brightness and reflection are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal is not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of it, which offers you & kpovmodeler; hopefully, you have already learned how much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracer, the rendering is reflected in the scene of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflect the scenes) by each pixel in the scene and how the atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene is reflected and how atmospheric effects can work like the mist. so the scene is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera that you can see the scene. without a light source, you can also see anything, the picture is simple black. obviously, any scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you can open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you have to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Represents the scene in the last stored version. all changes have been rejected since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry allows you only to select if you do not have any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reverse order command. this menu entry allows you only to select if you have used to use.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current windows rules and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting of & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the appearance, the keychains and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the scanning process. you can change with this option prefix for & kpovmodeler; -commands or new.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting up toolbars. you can add and remove this option tool bar for & kpovmodeler; -commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-map is a possibility to avoid rough surfaces without any hives on the surface, and without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric forms that can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body. these models will then be processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object colour to pixels, by application of a image file as color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuk show; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application features a file browser that you can select images to the display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuk show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with Click & LMBn; or key return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if each picture is displayed in a separate window, or whether all the images should be using the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, type the first character of the date in browser window. then a small input field appears in the right corner. if a matching date is found, the file will be highlighted by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or that a little more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functional scope, so it is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which allows you to give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; you need to make sure that & K3b is started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b provides the above K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is applicable only on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>

<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is a audio CD; reader for & kde; can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; the user interface of cdparanoia (compressed) is supported for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (compression free compression). currently, lame packets must be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD, read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the loss-free FLAC.</seg>

<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed, so it is not necessary to compile any thing for any Linux distributions. but if using FLAC, the installation is not needed, whose installation is not needed.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main introductory dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different cartoning cards (such as Encoder, to setup the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, costing and compression rates and helps you to choose the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are other similar to 'hormone' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices to play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, information about data compress according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG can now have a light advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important because both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is yet free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high-quality sound quality (for high bitrates), but compared to OGG easily deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - beginning 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer acceptable for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for stereo stereo audio systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs more than 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of one titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good comug to music by adolescents, portable devices and Autostereoirs. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you have absolutely the absolutely highest quality, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that can be entered manually or by the program automatically from freedb via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & audiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms, there are often a combination of program settings for Kodiers and these parameters. the manual or aid to the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s shall be encoded with lame, the switch -dtt of lame and the title parameter must be added by & kaudiocreator. the result looks as follows: '...</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters which can be used (= button designation in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, where you can download the audio CDs, so that all other information can download itself into the computer. it is to note that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberbot is not lawyer. however, nobody can prevent the & CD; more or less valuable, so it cannot be added to the artist nor the music company. all information can be used in a Bummel by a & CD; business, physically or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; it is active a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems to be used with another (counterfeit) address when using the server is not used (This may only know the programmer to know the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & audiocreator; for use of freedb, the geographical zone is to be used on the next lying mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freed.org provides a current list of mirror servern for the online retrieval of & CD; more information can be downloaded during a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What is the reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">It is rumours that cdparanoia is used to know in source code.... This was always the best choice for the read of audio CD; s. to observe that the cdparanoia package must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the WAV files, the codiers can be selected for the desired file format. in the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compressing for audio data) on the tab. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the appropriate Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used. this is also necessary for the predefined codiers. further information about Kodiers are in chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device number of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a hint on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want an copy-protected audio CD; check out the case of the & CD; this will not be yellow!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this may be as tips to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, but they are somehow unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you'll get enough information to set the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sample (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not fully free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files that you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you own write permission (eg; by trying to copy it with the cross-section).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audiocreator; something is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the presentation of a & CD, which must be repeated for every application & CD; repeats to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with you to use the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Even though we can change this settings at any time, we will not be able to change any & CD at any time, if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reader program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently is / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device designation of your drive. if this does not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is also available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to use there existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The cartoning card General Settings. here you can't do much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be loaded / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, you will be informed if information is missing to the words of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The disk card CD; -settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and leave the & CD; data automatically via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading & CD; it can be connected to the Internet, so that he can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you're not satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or tag entries, they can be changed slightly. the directory or file name will be changed with Conquorder - &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">In addition to this example, if you want to enter all manually, then deactivate the selection fields and freedb mode, if you want to use the database before. however, this is worth about 620 MB, if you want to use the database. however, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first box in the mode is set up on the following board card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are the settings for the data request, for retrieve the & CD; information from freedb server about the internet. how is the system that will get the CD? read the section via freedb. set out the section via freedb. set everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freed.org and look after a mirror server in your proximity. on this road the load is distributed between the computers. however, this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both works equal to the server, as many Firewalls the protocol 8880 standards, there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to translate any & CD; data on the freedb server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screen photo. (make sure that the folder / tmp is installed on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of permanent pieces simultaneously: excuse, there is a reason why more than one drive at only one existing drive? parallel reading and codile? the author knows not so easy to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last denominations: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom file for temporary files: if you cross this sign, then the path / folders can be saved in which the WAV files can be stored in which the WAV files are created, the files will not be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All then enter as it's on screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances must be baked anything after the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. this achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the command '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of creation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted on demand. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags:% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the input (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest like in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we have just finished the basic setup of & audiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each instructor of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you will never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described, as the process of reading & CD; we will create MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is organized, as we are convenient and the & CD; the process of the freedb is described, and the process of this section is described in this section, must be repeated for every application & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, see the screen photos a bit different than that for a & CD; with successfully from freedb reproduced data. therefore, you will learn how to get data manually from the Internet. comments on the differences may refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD must now be defined in the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; it could be identified and identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then seek questions and answers after help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been collected successfully from the freedb, all the titles of the pieces have already been filled and additionally displayed the name of the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there will be a window embedded, and you can select the database entry, your opinion is best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have chosen the check box for the automatic query from freedb (on the page & CD), you can also manually redeem this manually by selecting the first buttons in toolbar. if you have no local database, but you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Update title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidiers per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments using all the tracks of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful check of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to review the contents of the CD-Editors, so that you do not only begin with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words with big letter or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1-tags. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator. this option is set up at the tab card Kodierersettings; take a look at the tab 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. check in the help to help you obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select one entry, which is obviously true with the style of express CD. this example is not important because we do not have the & CD; -dates so why go to the website of freed.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' come back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors will be back and you see that the fields for the album is already completed with the entered data. simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure on the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the item list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check characters in front of each line. just the titles are selected. a simple click on the line will select that all the pieces are selected, or select the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was launched by clicking on the button selection process, so this window appears to be confirmation. click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and follow the end.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">These troubleshooting see if you are trying to work with a body that you are not installed yet. pieces that are not successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered in this example. have you checked if you have access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it's clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. so you can read and codile in parallel. please note the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to read this behaviour, the number of parallel processes is unclear. the calculator with an AMD64 seems no problem when simultaneously read and codified (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded, and a third order in the maintenance-long of the body is encoded. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be attached with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & kde; 3.5mm or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the coefficient of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; if you do not have a pre-compiled package, da & kaudiocreator; most distributions contain already a pre-compiled package, da & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; -package is already done. if you're reading this, you have already done it...</seg>

<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic adding to the collection is enabled, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) will be added automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, when opening a product the temporary collection is activated and geleert. this collection will then be added to the opening pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order where the songs can be played in the menu. if you choose the row after the menu of the menu, the songs are played in the sequence as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove a random order in the menu, the order will be re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump a song to jump a song, select the button foremost, the entry previous piece of the menu or press the button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, the temporary collection doesn't matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for synthesizer, which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, MIDI-Map General-MIDI events are translated into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always wanted to play a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only a sound card, you don't need any MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible with GM (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. you need to edit the appropriate file of hand (with your favorite picture).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that saves all required circumstances for playing one piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear as often as desired. for this, however, every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "name of the keymap..." END define KEYMAP "another keymap... END-CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that it is needed to display that a section begins (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section is specified as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are available in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds which supports this instrument to use the number M (GM Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which is similar to a defensive ring. then apply the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If now, a score of MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (defensive), it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone in the MIDI file is.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drum patch the patch is meant, when each sound is a different percussioning instrument (drum, tank, Maracas & etc;) and not the one, in which the tone gives the sound level of the same drum (as some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify like tones on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As the PATCHMAP section is the order of lines very important, as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple Keymaps for each channel and each instrument to use multiple Keymaps. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form sounds on the percussions channel. check out as an example the provided cone aps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to exchange some channels for the first and second channel, make it easy to use in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is used on the channel N. if you are using the keymap option, the keymap must be defined further in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will ignore all events that will change the patch on this channel. in this case the patch is always used Patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the percussions patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio should be multiplied, in which proportion of pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file is converted to the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is converted and then continue until the value 4096 is used to do so in the Map file no decimal kommas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM gives you a keyboard, which receives a Pitch Bender event with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, but try to play some keyboards up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog for MIDI settings. you can find in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of claviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel screen to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have changed a tool. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to display the played tones. view from the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD displays the speed which is played with a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a couch. if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about it has to be played like a music piece. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, and etc. so that the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices, just like two different musicians the same notes can play in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can convert zemary, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs you to change a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over all.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source of exchange and install (for example of kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. open the folder you want to add in & conqueror;, choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow button on the left from Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & cross-cross; -Desktop with my MIDI file and & kmid; if I want to play a karaoke file (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, only in the & Conqueror; -window change and select the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, if you want to add a file to a collection, switch the setting automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you want to play the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. you only want to play the first file. so, you can open the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains just this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join us to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs, listen to the postcard, continue to program & kmid.</seg>

<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ is used for the setting of the font, which are set up for the main text, the FuÃ ¨ Music etc. there are the following font names:</seg>
<seg id="1775">On the call of & kile; two selection options are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fixed the settings. 2. the document can be written by reason to hand on the hand.</seg>

<seg id="1779">The compilation of the document command should be searched for errors after the errors. when used by quick construction, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the protocol should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An area (English) is a text that is described differently than the remaining document. for example, a report with the text area should be created,\\ 'and\\ by {environment},\\' s and\\ by {environment}.

<seg id="1781">The changes only will be supervised within the surrounding area (by\\\ in {environment} to\\ by {environment}). there is no deception (number) for the changes within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many opportunities for the reading and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. can be used either by the command\\, or automatically at the end of the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is available for the cursive pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ Begin {Quote} and ends with\\ by {Quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background of the source code with the & latex; label language, this is now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & cile.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant was entered into a bit text, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be completed. if you need a quote, a few places in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, can be returned to the editor by editor or Strg E (on the internal viewing). when an external viewer must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file created, the document is printed or in a & PostScript; / PDF file can be converted. simply try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a silent file format (English D e V ice I nº). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi edition such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -umconverter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as required for the creation of the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed using file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is correct).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar aport the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; the conversion can start converting any other formats using the buttons in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The prediction of the direct jump from the editor to the right position inside the DVI; file.</seg>

<seg id="1794">In order to execute the advance search, the mouse pointer should be positioned in one line of the source code and can be clicked on the right side. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; viewer is then made.</seg>
<seg id="1795">This function in & eyepiece is made with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document the corresponding & latex; document linking & accessories; as text editor are set to set up as text editor (setup eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should the use of quick construction of the & DVI; viewer is not possible, can be an error. if an error occurred, this is displayed in the protocol file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The protocol file uses the error source in the source code. the protocol file is always used in the error. the protocol file is always used to consider the faulty line, must be clicked on the error in the protocol, navigating to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the appropriate button in the tool bar, a window appears to choose from the available template for the document. the default setting are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">With selection of empty document a document can be used either by reason to rewritten or the assistant to create a new document. further information are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">HÃ ¤ualized user of & latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates are created, stored and reloaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you need to create an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be created or create a new file created by using an existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by a file, some string labels will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or drawing coding). these variables are set up in settings... settings are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know what character strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by the input in documentation class. typically, it is used to be used:\\ Short class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {5]}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the Assistants and the associated entry into the editor. as soon as the document has been created following this way:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, then the own template can be used instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files can be created. if a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps of described above described above.</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declare if they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better viewing and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits are displayed in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can contain only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but does not contain any element of itself otherwise.</seg>

<seg id="2017">All TagXML files have to start with a & XML; file data: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be closed and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">No spaces influence nothing but battles on & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files the tools dialog box above the & quantitative procedure; -window to start and check-up TagXMLA. another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. at present, review will only take place when purchasing the TagXML files in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1-XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -scheme. the file name for this TagXML file should be Schema.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2026">A promotion can be set with settings.. click on the same dialog for the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion has been assigned to this promotion. with clicking on the User button, a button closure can be assigned; with Keiner is the current keychains.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered and inserted a text in the detail settings and inserted in the document of the action on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change or as input (or parts of the document), but are the fast start dialog or the various Behold in... promotions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% skriptyou in the command line: global script file: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative process; the text will be replaced with the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control the PID number; this is useful if DCOP is used to control & fixaplus; from an external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, normally the name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, a script can be obtained from & quantitative aplus; the default input can be determined. in the selection box input can be determined, what to default. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually done with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the output can also be redirected. there are two types of issue: normal output, to the default output edition; error messages which should be done on the default output written by the value of the selection box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the specified case it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you must add actions and configure your settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are fairly self-explanatory. press the new action button at the lower end of the window starts working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day attributes and you can plan their use, activate the dialog "Day" when available, therefore a input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a denial symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon? will we replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better, we will use & kiconecredit; choose from the menu menu, graphics other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose the size of others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol no only helps you to notice that the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly interpreted, further interpreted), or should at least to signalized a message to the user that click on the current document; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this happens over the menu with settings actions... (in & quantitative aplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it still gives, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantitative information; functions for the toolbar or it should be shared through some cutting into several groups. open the tool to set the toolbar via Settings toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to choose the Trenner (left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element, which should be added to the tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I would like to add a quick way to access the cross-queror preview. I will select and add the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner does not support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & Conqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proportional to all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back to the right folder. after reeXML does not exist in the right folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please fit your & scripts, so that their toolbar (s) should be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mentioned extension of & quantitative information; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or formatting language that you like like a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantitative information, if anyone has done this already for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. then we have to transfer the first part we will cover the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for this documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation Section 1 = section 1.html html 2 = User 1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level Elements Top element = PHP 4.2 / # top level Elements Top Element = index.html Getting Started = introduction,... introduction = Manufaction.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = Setage.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that there is no known subfolder in tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess club (except the imitators) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents can be referenced directly to a file (and consistent at the upper end of the building process & mdash; folders is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but make up & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative information; Resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the field of docrc file, which should be displayed on the design of a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly. by selecting the function called and pressing Ctrl; H for context-help would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the text list (Context List) and the file connectors.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of multiple context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and save $HOME / .kde / Quanta / doc / doc / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (such as you have given this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation here.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and it's worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation is used to the & quantitative information; -Repository, but you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative aplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email menu, such as DTD DTD Package (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archives, where all other & quantitative information can be reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and used for the publication. to use a user full contribution to what it provides a GPG / PGP key. this makes the source of resources, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several key. in the dialog box you need to pass a look. in the dialog box New resource needs to be filled (URL preview can be left empty) and with clicking on OK the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can instantly upload the menu DTD DTD package (DTEP), and instantly upload tool bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installing a resource, the impureness of the resource is warned and it can be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the indication of the owner of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not able to work by a DTEP package because hundreds of day files can be created in tagXML format. there is the simpler way to convert DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD loading and convert a DTD. choose the .dtd file with the DTD description that will be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination name: the newly created & DTEP; it is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitions: the string, which is in the! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after transformation: if activated, & quantitative capaplus; after converting the & prescriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & fixaplus; there are some key concepts. to be able to understand and make full advantage of & quantitative concepts. this chapter has to offer them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & fixaplus; the working range is divided into three areas: global, locally and projects. this differentiation affects a number of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantitative information; uses, available in the common folder of & quantitative information; this enables the group of administrators different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree to secure each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a certain project. this can be all of & CSS; designs up to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a certain project. simple, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative syllus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorial window, the construction views, the board of cartiliters with infos and the toolbars. please select in, and for further information about this areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the boxes with the right mouse button, to receive a context menu with the current document passwords, such as close to the current, other or all boxes of the document, jump or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right in the Editorial area lead to a further context menu concerning the documenting documentation, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / insert), editing the mouse under the mouse pointer or opening the file if the character string is named under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorial window, the toolbars of the Editors. currently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional will be shown as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & fixaplus; the toolbars will be adapted to the new functions and thus associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert it, then click the icon which the day represents, then you can enter the data for this straight day. if you want to insert the data for this straight day (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog for different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) allow to navigate to the information about & quantitative information, to navigate and through strip. in the representation with cartilitators stand for files, project, patterns, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, the & quantitative click. this view shows all the files in the project and allows the management of files in the project using right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, upload or delete the files from memory media can be carried out by the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of templates and quantitative information; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole web site & etc; there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available for the appropriate users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more about templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of the integration in Global, Lokal and Project will also work here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. the right mouse button are available further functions such as the script to start, edit or send using email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by links-click of an element set the cursor in the document to the position of the element. by right click a list of commands to navigation and collection of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it can change manly attributes and namespaces. the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the full documentation to download web technology for your development. you can download the documentation for & quantitative documentation; you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & fixaplus; two cartiliter at the lower end of the window, can be reached via the usable information, the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartiliter is showing information about each in Quanta running script. such, e.g. the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cartridge reiter shows all the errors in the current document of the current document. & quantitative scripts, which are executed, give all error messages (such as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & fixaplus; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate box is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantitative aplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with email. & quantitative aplus; send the toolbar as a compressed Tar-Archive via & kmail; if you get a tool bar in an email, you can secure them in & quantitative information.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantitative information; autoconf has a number of options that can be handed to the configure script. to configure a complete list of options, give. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at start & fixaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before her bin folders. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative aplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative aplus; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort, the best & HTML; editor began to employ the developers of & quantitative; it would be an independent, extended Markup languages editor? well, this would do it to the absolutely great Web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative aplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together, you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantitative; therefore the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantitative community is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; Developaplus; this idea is not only possible, but it is not only possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantitative aplus; as it allows users to expand your needs.</seg>

<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents in the menu, grouped according to the file names of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens up a existing project from hard disk. & quantitative aplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables to copy graphic files into your project folder or a subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have a further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantitative aplus; the project manages. in the chapters & quantitative aplus; projects will be explained.</seg>

<seg id="2152">A dialog appears to delete or add entries to the toolbars or to change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">That should generate an aid according to the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative aplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as at any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantitative form; the development in financial form will be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">Fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as according to the design of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file will automatically be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative file; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letter and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file will be stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine that you want to access, one, except one processed local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>

<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local file system to the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="2164">However, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, they should be bound. if a project is restarted on new, not anhack.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. one can select the desired files by clicking on or through removing the hemogues, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistants contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploading in the menu-tree in the menu tree or with the keyboard shift Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings are described in the project assistants and are described in detail. additional entries will be explained below.</seg>

<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, you can change event actions and add these actions to change or delete. event actions are executed if a previously specified event takes place, such as the sickle of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default & quantitative capaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behaviour is currently not able to influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select a project from the menu Project or the Symbol Project. the Project Project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantitative aplus; closed, the project file will be stored automatically. they are asked if you want to save changes in front of the default, if & quantitative aplus; changed files. the same happens if you invite a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project development view are free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">File behavior as well, however, the entries do not want to open and open with... in the right mouse button on the right mouse menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can find various profiles. the profile contains information on the location of highly approvals files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Enables removing of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is blown up to avoid removing the removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the kernel memory and must be forgotten. this possibility is useful if frequency uploading files is necessary and the rather unsecure password will not be able to store this option.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & fixaplus; many high-loading profiles can be created and so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. when working or creating a profile this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to change, except the network administrator runs a service not connected to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attacking swelling, this is either a timely saving function or a danger. please use it to your discretion. the password will be stored on the plate, so that it can't be read, but each with programming languages it can easily be seen in the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can be downloaded in a project many views, i.e. by simply diver of the view, diverse files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu Project or the Project Toolbar, accessible via the settings of tool toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & fixaplus; to which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of & quantitative capaplus; to make your own work.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & fixaplus; best over the menu toolbars. use and adding the toolbars below in the section adding toolbars below.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols can be set either by using the context menu (right click on the toolbar), which can be set up different actions like toolbar, toolbar strip or toolbar, which may be specified in the dialog where actions are visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (icon) on a tool bar, the entries will be removed in addition to the entries and action which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbars... and settings are set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are important documentation, code Schnitzel and files to link. & quantitative aplus; used templates, like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any of the system available existing in the anteroom-tree. templates have in & quantitative capaplus; in about the restrictions you need to present for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative capaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions at the beginning of any template conditions before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using linknotations (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in advance tree under global templates. additional information regarding templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text documentation. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple report for the purpose and organising the work in the appropriate way to be efficiently. some examples may be found in advance tree under global templates. see in for more information regarding templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always added to the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a full note on Javascript or Perl. some examples are available in advance tree under global templates. see in for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be arranged in a file structure, together in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitative information.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a documentary structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File As template to save local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it was filed as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check out in the context of the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and shutdown on the building view.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only copy in a preliminary folder. it can be used to use all file management functions, such as pulling and insert or insert about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can select in the file tree or in the project files building process to create a folder on the right and secure site template to secure a name for the template and secure. by default, it will be secured as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very targeted approach. you can add headlines and footlines or dynamic with & PHP; design, add files or linked with them. additionally you can keep some things when using templates in projects very deepest in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The structure structure in the subwindow templates is based on the $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / Templates and $HOME / .kde / Quanta / Templates / Quanta / templates. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers, as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to define the behavior of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties tab in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is low as soon as the attributes of the attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and fits for everything except the staves in the introductory overview. if a family file would be set in principle, unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is likely to be in a family folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Permitted a copy or presented text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines and footlines for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equip a folder with special headlines / footlines a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, by the context menu (show, right mouse button press) over a full command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative aplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source editor, which are accessible via the menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; Editor and the Second share the Editorial window in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it invites you a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and install the source code editor in which the changes in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document called & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing & PHP. there is no plans to change these behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except for the changes in the source code editor and the cursor in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor, this mode is already active, this mode is already active in the active cursor from a window to the others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... According to the selection of VPL; view it may automatically choose between synchronization according to a click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be set in addition to the time. generally, the recommendation applies: a small spanne for fast calculator and a great fun for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to choose the documentation of unvisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. this document is also called to create a new document with the VPL; editor. this means that the reduction of the hanging body can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags shows the storage of information about the document itself e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. metable elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows the change of inhaltes, such as keywords on the column name and keyword keywords on the content -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to the creation of pages in browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below list or delete a change on the list is exactly as with the metable elements. the works of CSS rules are currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to mount an external CSS styles by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is like in a text processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor holds as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted through intipping and can be deleted by pressing button or distance.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insert of tags will be made in the same way through the toolbars, as in the source code editor. it is recommended that the insert of tags is not removed, e.g. an anchor day, surrounded by text, any other ambient anchors must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the Tables Assistant or lists are disabled. they will work later in the & VPL; you will need to work in this release tables or lists toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for investigation of styles. in contrast to other programs for styles, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of styles can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for the same. why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the Beiter had made many changes and changed simultaneously on many places. another programmers had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when combined.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program was given by me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence regarding the places where perhaps the indemnity had been changed. the merger of this changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & cdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any quantity of more useful features were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare text quickly, copy it to the clipboard and add it into one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made much work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & cdiff3; almost in a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons are working independently of one piece of code work and changes. the original file (the base) helps increase the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result. the screen photo shows three Quell files to merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& cdiff3; helps you with the same and merge complete folder. this screen photo shows & cdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& cdiff3; shows the exact differences and diversify the possibilities today today color monitors. if you are frequently check, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are visible. if lines only distinguish in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the left in the column on the left side. (no trouble more if you change the feeding.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates that the file is different. red colour means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily write the Tipparity work by simply write the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder for folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows manual type of file names to select the file from the list of file. open dialog turns your selection and shows it again. you need to specify no third file in the next time. if you don't need to enter the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can choose a folder when you select a folder, if you select a folder, then the same or merge file will be selected for B and C, then used & cdiff3; the file names from A in both other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When meeting is crossed, the input field is active for the destination and it is not necessarily necessary to define an output file immediately. you can also use this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can define options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you would like to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text box. & cdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in open dialog, you need to select any files, you can simply connect the dialog box with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and shutdown: drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes it contains a file like several similar functions. if you want to figure out what these functions are, this would be a relatively large effort. you would have to compare two corresponding files, it's in & cdiff3; download and compare these things. now, you can easily copy the relevant sections, and then compare these functions.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: there are currently nothing of & cdiff3; draw out the text of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and storing text in another program as cutting and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such cases your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box the information line is the sign A, B or C, the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window is optional). (if the path to a file is long, let the mouse can rest a while on the line. then a small relief window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are assigned to letters A, B and C. a colour is blue, B, green and C is magenta. (this presets can be changed over the settings menu).</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one sees the color that distinguishes itself. if both files differ, the default color is especially useful if you compare three files. this is good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text, the column is shown. if differences were found, the color shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in drawing chains and comments, for the processor and in a few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the clause column from the text is interrupted by the digits where the respective source file is enabled. if the line is activated, the line is shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison list) has also a info line with the inscription issue:, the file names and [gechanges] if you have handled the result. usually it contains a result by the automatic merge text, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been dissolved, Save is disabled!!! (do you use the buttons to find out the most remaining conflicts to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, any difference can be solved at the same time even a conflict of the manual.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed, where the group will not be visible in the windows.) This group is then highlighted the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current section and on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no further line in the group; then there is no further line in the group; then the text is displayed in these lines; but this text is not displayed in the file, nor yet another source. this text appears not in the final stored file, nor in a marking which you might have to copy and what else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; collision system; however, it appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window, do not be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you select the options to ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with the image processing and the mouse, but you can also use the arrow keys left, right, high, runder, side, right, end, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, Siw can also be used in addition to the vertical image strip in addition to the vertical image strip.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to work. with the insert button, you can switch between single-feet and overload mode. (default is the plug-in mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already described in the section of merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / last difference (Ctrl-down / Strg-above), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Strg image downward) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl image downwards / Strg-picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Figure / Strg-Image). therefore, it must not be automatically deleted as conflict. therefore, it must be distinguished between soluble and unaffected conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this option is enabled, the manual copying and manual copying files. be careful with this option, because you might understand the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenarians are stored according to the common operating system. UNIX versions use a line-line-line\, and Win32-based systems use the line-line\\\\. Kdiff3 reserves the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & cdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of most recently used files will be stored automatically and reproduced during the next start. (menu insert - &gt; Kdiff3)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a script with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, the differences are displayed in cursive Scripture. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Based on systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed. at these systems the button presets automatically introduces an unparalleled color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, when pressing the tab button, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted. otherwise, a tabulator sign will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press the input or return, the inclusion of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, any selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. manual copying into the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type-line type you prefer to store. the default value is the usual standard selection on the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When attempting files to find & cdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be ignored in source files. the second step compares every line. in this step, white signs will not be ignored. also in combination, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car backdrop '\' at the end of a line, but then you might save files with different sizes in page-on-side comparison. if this option is enabled, the car backdrop is visible, however, as a white sign will be disabled. during assembly, this option has to be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters are ignored ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored the differences, but they will be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default setting, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively after even smaller signatures. the option is activated in the default setting. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatic Exchange mode, this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unaffected conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatically all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file than source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you need to use the features of choosing A / B / C for all ungeloily white conflicts. note that the automatic selection should also be ignored in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapters for scanning of folders and merge of a merger. look for details on documentation for the directory to comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already a older version exists, then the original version will be the suffix .original file, if already exists a backup file with the suffix .original, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fit the language of the user interface. changing this option does not support the current running program. you need to start & cdiff3; exit and restart. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & cdiff3; not available because the language is set globally across the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if one activates this option, all entries can be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">A short note for the coding appears a short note that is the local coding. (this may not be changed here and has for you an informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this influences how special characters is treated and interpreted. as the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file, you can set up here which should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they may not work with your codec. (e.g., your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only fix with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the encoding of the output of pre-processing.</seg>
<seg id="2344">If you turn right to suppress the changes of changes in white characters in text or review. (Note: this applies also for changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a colorfully coded transverse column are displayed. but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & B; B, A & B; -gt; C or B & B; C is displayed next to the normal still a second transfer column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply drag the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Listed the comparison window side by side or another. this can be useful to the display of long lines. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, consider the differences and decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as a preset name for output file. (if this function is used to start the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed out first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own image processing, which allows you to remove this function such as to remove parts or correct setup.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command was given (see above), then the output of the command is used only at the line. you can write your own relief processor which corresponds to your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is more flexibility when inserting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program itself. the good news is that in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">In this context, use this pre-processing command to convert the input in uppercase: SED\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's in the first clauses. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated character strings (info: / cvs /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with SED, you might have to understand it and perhaps like this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignored of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further precursing command of line. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, i.e. virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you would like to perform several licenses at once. then you can use the Semicolon ';' to separate the requirements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED, you can also use something different such as perl. perl -e's / switch 'allergies are needed at perl some details differently. where SED\\\ (and\\) needs only needed (and) without the leading'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal procedure will be retained for displaying and merge. further operations change only the data that the line-equal-algorythmus looks.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal pre-processor, the line processor indicates the output of the regular preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful but as in any function, the text changes or differences are hidden, you can't notice certain differences and destroy in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers must process many files in a folder. from this reason you can compare with & cdiff3; complete folder recursive and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... making a proposal to perform a proposal; you can customize the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without you to perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... causes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the same and merge of individual files very similar. you need to open only folders in the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the basis. if no target folders is used, used & cdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start the merge, select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 button. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform you a small news window over the current progress. if you break the folder file, only the files are listed below that time.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, shows & cdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Any file and any file which was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can choose a object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The file structure will normally be folded, by clicking on the + / - click, or on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all sub-directories with which you can open all folders and flaps all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case the colluros action can not be selected automatically. if the merger is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C are red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">Identical to identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">The file is considered to be identical when all of you are identical, then the same color is the same color. in folder, age is unconsiderable for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colors are mirrored the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red is.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C cannot have the same file type (e.g. a folder and B one file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. a folder and B one file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folders were given and if the option directories synchronize. then chooses & cdiff3; the required action is to be identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: together and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as the visible file names for the output file only B; directly after the merge and kdiff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the option of new file instead of merge (unsafe), the date of files and beats the newer file. if the files are different but the date is identical.. Solange such errors do not be eliminated, the interaction can not be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is based on the other. if the merger was successful, and according to other messages, if something unexpectedly occurred. if the merger is completed, you should make a final review and see if the status is okay.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When entering the setup dialog, Kdiff3 will show further columns. this contain the number of unmonasteries, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders can be compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either lead the straight selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all-feet actions (even in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folders, then in the three-file merge mode C, it is used as a goal, the two-file merge will be selected as a goal and to synchronize A and / or B as a goal.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folders. there are some options due to specific entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select folders / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the CTRL key): select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">When using contradictive data types still exist, a message appears on the incorrect elements. you can select a valid promotion for them then.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears using the options, simulating and breaking down.</seg>

<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually summarised, these entries (in the current session) and leads them not again together. even if the merge result was done or not saved, these entries will be done as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the stated pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree. separate placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. file does not need to conform to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders comply with this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can use more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as dividing characters. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders comply with this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can use more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as dividing characters. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set-specific using a .cvsignal file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignals.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a slot attribute. this option allows you to choose whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched on, symbolic linking is compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to the links. this is deactivated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In links to the folder: if the option is switched on, the links are treated as normal folders and recursively searches the links like normal folders and recursive. (note that this option would lead to a folder link and lead & cdiff3;) This option is shut down in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unforter, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files that does not contain any text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare great folders through a slow network, it may be faster, just the change date and file size. this speed advantage is a certain degree of safety. please note with caution. this option is used in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered as identical if it has been big when copying the change date. please be careful with caution. this option is used in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronize mode if two folders are compared and no target folders. in this mode the proposals are selected so that the results are identical to both folders. this option is switched off in both folders. this option is shut down in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered insecure, because the other file is not changed.) This option should be shut down in any case.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced by another version or deleted, the original version is renamed and gets the extension .original. if an old backup file is already exists, this will also be deleted without any further backup. this option is enabled in the default setting. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder clergy is visible to the interaction of individual files. if you don't want to move the window with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window & text window, you can switch the window to the window menu and switch between the two views between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to get a file easily by double click. however, there is also a single file, you can also run directly to the folder menu. as soon as you can save the folder, the status is set to be done and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost, if you want to read the directory again: directory menu: new options</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line is compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">One URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be distinguished if a link shows a file or a folder. then it will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or change of change. therefore vary the permissions or change of change from the original. (note that this option is possible for local files.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the differences of differences in KDevelop. KDevelop starts always start the built-in differences of differences. in order to start Kdiff3, press the right button of mouse over the differences of differences and then choose In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & cdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as KPart, it takes & diff3; the names of the original files from the patch file has to exist. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & cdiff3; the program patch is to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the cross-section you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that this does not work when the original files has changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & cdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the same of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it's comedy) is already available. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it may result as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs already very long and I have much learned in the sources of other programs. this is my grateful to all the programmers who went this way or go to it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and automatically compiled the right prefix to KDE. in default, KDE will not find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. cdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you can find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs varies, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white sign varies, the line is not identical. if the Lines may be not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The Editor is indicated for any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design extra an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too big. you can recover a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text, suddenly, no src left; appeared and the text can't be extinguished. what does this and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& cdiff3; used as many colors for emanating differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use any other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troublers came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & cdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE, you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found under http: / / diff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; compile and install, use the following command in the basic folder of the & cdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-You are the folder in your system, installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compiling. should you occur difficulties, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut off (Ctrl-X or Shift) in the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders are not published in the folder, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to update the folder to this options with the function Update Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries indicated that the differences may not have to be copied to the target folders. if the target file does not include these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behaviour is probably modified in a later program version.) This option is displayed in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are attached to one of the buttons, the lines from the respective window will be attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already present), they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default, this option is disabled. the differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual workspace. it is quite convenient to change the running programs to the work areas to stop them or move it. this works both within a desktop than also at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual workspace as well as the applications in the current applications. the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle of mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop as well as other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & kpager; however, the context menu is clicked on the empty background and the name of the application as well as the entries must appear, maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the following commands are:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only if a application was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if on an application was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, window can be moved within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this box is crossed, it will be displayed in the & kpager; the names of virtual workplaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">The cross of this field can display the & kpager; the numbers of virtual workplaces can be crossed together with name, the names are provided with ordinate, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this box is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this box is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & kpager. otherwise, only the empty workplaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager can be determined here: classic, & kpager; in a 2xn-grid appear, as from pager applications in some other windows, shows all virtual workplaces in a vertical section, which is very good for the representation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniprogram in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can display in size, the window as symbols or with their content and postpone can also run outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent removal of switch-switch... allows the dialog box settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog for Settings. but you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the File $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have any write permission to the file, you need to register as a user root or join your system administrator. in this file you need to refer to the key windowTransparentMode 1 and this one value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded by new functions. it is optimized for use on high-weak machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you can start & kmag; the main window appears by & kmag; shows the enlarged range of screen. in the following window, this window appears as a magnifying window.. The image that is displayed in the magnifying window is a enlarged range of screen and is designated as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting is enlarged & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a movable magnifier. alternatively, you can add a selected screen range in the magnifying window (selection screen mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer on the screen (eg; on the left-screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse pointer in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that the mouse is not able to recognize the form of mouse. this is always the default port; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection box mode, you can move the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can pushing the contents of the magnifying window and move it with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you are in addition to the & Shift; press or the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain, and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, copy in a file to insert into the clipboard (to insert it later in other applications), the image and much more.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a while, once the mouse pointer a while on the same spot. it is thought to help people who prepare your mouse click pain. furthermore, it can emulate it with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can the pain handle that the mouse is created and helps to use the cause of pain without pain. unfortunately, by the bloom because of your computer, you should try to search the use of your computer, if you do not have a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to clear it again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps you create when using the mouse, it is against pains that are caused by the mouse because of all ergonomic auxiliary equipment: the result can drop every different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click when you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shifting is activated, & kmousetool; a break after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice but you need to get quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This stress has to be stored after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; click a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If this is enabled, the turn-down time (1 / 10 s) is active. here is the time set, the & kmousetool will be waiting here before using the mouse button before it will start the mouse button if the mouse does not have to leave the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; this function is activated automatically, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow reference to the left and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. this moves will be stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to sound & multimedia, choose the sound system and here the rider General. there is a shooting Sound Puffer, which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool will start & kmousetool; this function is currently just under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments please do the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings on the values which were stopped when opening the dialog. have already pressed the button user, the settings will be reset to the last pressures of user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool to first use & kmousetool. in particular, the intelligent shifting should first be switched off. if you want to set off the automatic mouse, you can increase the intelligent shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; compared to sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window, which cannot use link because you can park your mouse to such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse printer, you should clean your mouse. it is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only cleanse the mouse, but also the rolls that come with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse button. as that happens, the mouse is set to mouse differently. however, it should be clear when you watch the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball, you would have to see the roll. these are located on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. the Dreck and the soiling can easily be scratched with a flat blade or the fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system run by & kmousetool; if it's just started a delay speed, this means that & kmousetool does not mean that the operation cannot stop longer by the lot of mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use one window manager and one window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click here. this is the status of & kmousetool; re-set and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse button and put the cursor into another spot.</seg>

<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can move it into this way to copy it into the clipboard and want to move it into the clipboard or any other action. however, there will likely be some problems. here are some advice about this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shifting not if you just start & kmousetool. select text instead. select a mouse click and hold the switch-off button, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and again the mouse button once again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Do not use the audible mouse click. this makes any time when & kmousetool; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the intelligent shifting too without the audible mouse click. but you need to use some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; you have to use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be installed in most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and set it correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2622">In order to understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program "commercial-dispatcher has been working with a text, distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readern has the highest priority. it will be proposed to all other applications and keeps these orders. if the output of the Screen reader is read, the requested orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news such as & eg; processor is too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News, the next priority priority. a message underbreaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application that can read messages. while you welcome to read a long text on a web site, you can enjoy the room. & kde; -alerts are also News. read this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order, which you use from the cartoning card is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular Dringness.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types will be processed in waiting-long, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if a application read the output of a screen readers, while & ktops; just a file read, this issue will hold and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen reagents. they will be applied to normal warning, messages and text applications as well as & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter process the text and give it on the next filter. at the time there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as a modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character string replace parts of a text by other text. the resulting parts can specify either as words or as regular expressions. it is supplied with pre-defined character strings such as: -) by text or for the conversion of messages from & conversation; or & mail; in a better comprehensible form.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this cardboard box you can arrange special actions that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktops; processed four types of language contracts:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readern has the highest priority. it will be proposed to all other applications and holds this orders. after the output of the Screen readers will be read, the requested orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is too hot. a warning holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message underbreaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read messages. if you can read & eg; just a long text on a website, you can welcome you with & kmouth; nevertheless, someone welcome you to enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen readers, add & ktts; the audio output into the maintenance long.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text is interrupted. if the introductory sound is active as well as introductory message, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this box ticket are valid only for normal text orders. for messages, warnings and expenses of screen-reagents there are no particular promotions when they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To start with & ktops; KNotify news to read, start kttsmgr and click messages. the card messages appears.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for the control of voices, the microphone speed, the voice of voice and pitch. also brands for the control of the language of abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, a further W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (UK male) since this is the standard voice in the edition of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional efficiency filter (SDB filter). SBDs must start reading, since only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order. so you can also stop orders or stop, even if the language synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional detection filter. when the first start of & ktops; it is automatically set up a proposition limit filter. you can change its settings or more propositional detection filter, but the beginner is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to try out the setup selection, and enter text to read. check the phone selection once again. check the phone selection again, change some features and check how the selection of the spokesperson must be changed. you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then faster with the presentation, since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can terminate text orders to hold or abrupt your function, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal Sattense filter filter is automatically set up when you can start the tsmgr for the first time. it cannot be removed only. do not change anything at this filter, unless you do what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional detection filter liken text with a regular expression for satzers and add a Tabulator (Decimal code 8) to the satzlimit (tablets are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard cross-limit filter to the character is retains.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied to & kde; News (kisers), warnings, news or the output of screen reagents.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from the normal set-limit filter, you can insert this again by exporting the file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the Card Card Interphone selection, you can overwrite the microphone settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the box card). in other words, no microphone properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the matching speaker that has all features of a furnished speaker. if you are not able to delete or edit the settings; otherwise select & ktops; otherwise select & ktops; the speaker that originally set up the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for input of the desired microphone properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the features of the desired microphone station. if this feature is no role, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark the check box if the property has priority before other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when the issue is, it is always possible to specify this feature. the only case in which you may want to specify the attribute language, if you know that a specific application text is sent in another language as the working environment in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the characteristics of the speaker that is to delete the following below, click on the selection button Standard Speaker and then use on speaker that corresponds to the following below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the waiting long. you can also specify a order number. (without order number is input 0 needed).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Gamer is crashed and & ktops; probably, you have to register GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved yet. if the problem is not solved yet, it is not a compatible version of gamer. you can try to upgrade or uninstall track.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA doesn't work when I am working simultaneously with another application music. if I get a text order, friert & ktops; one message appears, says: 'to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system the problem that conflicts can occur at ALSA, which will prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. information for possible solutions will be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-projected.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I installed them and can use it in the festival but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download and install the rpm package as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical surface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not enough, but in addition, the development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic networks are given, all by & knetworkconf are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section may not replace more information about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of PCs in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">At present, IP networks can be operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). only 5 has never found large spread. from IPv6 it is expected to go through the near future. this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the response point where a valid IP address can be done or if available, the IP address can not be selected as desired.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When creating a separate small (home) network, the IP address should be selected for this purpose reserved to avoid IP address conbilling with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course you can access the Internet for such machines through setting of an Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask usually set on 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the standard route is required for IP blocking.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The mains address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are stored by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file will sometimes be dynamically modified in DSL connections, so it does not be surprised, if in case of active DSL connections another content is set to be set there.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; this may be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; moil the band back and reads the pretensioning information of the tape. recognizes & crdat; the occurrence on the band will be asked if the tape is being formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2897">If everything went off, the symbol for the tape drive to show that the band is bound in the status bar. in the status bar, the content of the tape can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to the expiration of the bandes, initially the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; gives a change of symbol for the band to recognize that the integration of the band was solved and shows a corresponding message. the band can now be rejected without a danger.</seg>

<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup procedure, you need to select the files that can be found on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Choose a file or folder in local file tree. only this file or the folder is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a Secure fil in the tree. only the files are secured in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with a Häkchen. only the so selected files and / or sub-folders are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2910">Select one file or folder in one of the archive in the entry for the drive. it is only tested for the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in one of the archive for the band with a Häkchen. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are checked.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can lead the restore files, the files must be re-manufactured, marked. this may take place on two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives which include the entry for the tape drive. only the selected file or sub-folders can be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a Häkchen. only the so selected files and / or sub-folders are recovered.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create bandthreaded file using the Bandinhaltes. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index to two kinds of volume:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is created with the straight line profile with the straight selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder where the backup should be made. the list of the files will be updated automatically according to the currently selected workfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files that are described in the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are located on the same file system, you can select separately under the backup file. each entry will be considered independent of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have been changed since the last inincremental backup, a snapshot file will be secured only, which has since changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the past incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files are secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; and then; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can arrange the settings on the menu item KDat... in the menu Settings... the following settings can make it:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-reload version of the band device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & cdat; before the band is connected to the drive. with some drives, this is necessary before reading and write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tries & crdat; the design of the tape drive to lock. possibly this setting does not work in all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when soldering the integration of & kdat; automatically expire the band. use this option not at floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tries & kdat; the hardware file size for belt drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a band formatted, writing a file at the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the band. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this character string is host name: seconds, whereby the name of the system is formatted on which the tape is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era was formatted in the band.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file using the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -Archive that can manage directly with & GNU, - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not used to incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & ksystem log; experienced users with fast access to the example on problems which occur on their server. & ksystem log; tries to provide some extended functions and can be filtered with the help of the protocol files certain programs and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & kser.log; a number of useful features. include among others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different kinds of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & ksystem log; functions available, with their help the individual protocol lines can be easily filter and sort them. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystem log; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol. will you not start with system administrator right. the protocol files will normally be under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal users usually have no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filters in the filter bar. the list of the protocol changes will be automatically altered, so that only protocol changes will be displayed next to the selected filter. then, a protocol line is displayed only if in one of the columns the character string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place. select the string of the filter search term only with the entries in the protocol file protocol. select it also to the name of a process, so it shows & ksystem log; all protocol lines will be sent or created in this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error will be displayed with a striking colour as protocol lines of level indication. the color representation of protocol lines can be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can check the process identification (PID) in the column process, if you want to investigate the output of a specified command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you can use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, the option can jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystem log; allows you to use multiple protocol files into separate signatures. to open this function window to open and manage the entries in the menu window to open and manage. once you have chosen one window, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kser.log; has a dedicated website on http: / / ksystem log.forum-software.or.Dort you find further current information about the reference of & ksystem log;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksong log; can also be found in the following file of the & kde; -Subversion Archivs: ksystem log; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; system V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section takes some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init develops rapidly to the standard control of the program starts at the start of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to go on the historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try to set a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and new format. therefore, you need to ensure that the old Init was removed there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from BSD Init, that the configuration files can be found in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you find rc.sysinit and following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole amount of scripts. in principle you need to start a script for every system service, which you want to drive on another round level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services include not such things as setserial which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be able under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is not much use for this. you can also run a rc.serial / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default is runlevel 3. if you want to change the default. if you want to change anything, then you can repair any thing, then proceed to restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is a argument like start and stop. you can start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K includes, the script will stop the argument with the argument, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server -Runlevel, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say to trivial: draw a entry in the range of availability system to one of the six round level to start it on this level (or stop stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveling or set the position within one level by changing it. this will only be removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this happens if they take an entry in the area of availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed when you choose to check this in a new area. if you choose to select a new runlevel or from the context menu and then add to the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single was sometimes not calculated. in such case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the paper basket. be careful so.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 stop, runlevel 1 stop, etc.) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another round level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a single entry, press the input button to change the characteristics dialog button to accept the dialog box button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of the data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preorders are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are saved by & ksysv; otherwise, changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of this distribution, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are required (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply not quicker without news if your configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
