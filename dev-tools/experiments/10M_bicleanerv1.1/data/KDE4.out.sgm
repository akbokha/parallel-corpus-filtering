<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly on your site. if you do have enough photos, then you will be using subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. then you will then use a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as proversioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% working files and you will not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the pile processing simpler. split new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The split of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or underived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to enable Metadata in & digial. this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently select the metadata from the database by selecting the appropriate point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what if you want to change what if you want to change? in addition, the metadata editor for a number of selected attribute is available. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now start the real work, since you should select every photo of the words, describe and assessing a review. of course you can select all the images that you need the same attribute. you start the best with the rating or follow-ups. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now come with keyword, keywords how to continue with other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import katalogised pictures from another source with embedded samples, then print & digiplug. automatically the images of the hierarchy is no problem and can be easily done by removing a substrate on another. the changed keywords are pursued by & digious; updated while the subtrees persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics features like different metadata. this is a very large representation of metadata, as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the words - the next section refers to labelling or comments on the third important tool to katalogise your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to see most of your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this of the landing site of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image to create an interest. if you know pictures you should show a story. remember, the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him to understand the motive that you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's okay if a picture is not perfect when the strength has only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can also use a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8) as a labelling. you can even export your images into the label and / or the title of the Web Gallery system. you need to tell us the story so for the opening of a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train moves the spatial presentation now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">You can get rid of the possibilities of geolalization. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can easily read through images with geographical data. you can also export the pictures at the recording location. you can also export the pictures as well as Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google Earth viewer viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a vocal game with copyright and denotes the practice the copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all versions, thus also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digiplug; when information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (Synonym for Erger and Writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, it may not be changed once. this field does not support Semikolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author files (synonym for the author): linked with the author. this field contains the name of the photographer. examples for this can be as: employee photographer, Freialist photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merging to the author, this also must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (Synonym for providers): use the Anbieterfeld to identify the photo. if the photographer has been working here. if the photographer has been listed here if the picture is a storage photo, then the group / agency will be given the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright-sections, although this has no protection against misuse, or change it. the solution for this problem is digital watermark. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in the picture. & digiplug; it will present a module for stack processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk error, record loss, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, temperature, temperature, data area, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kind of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem in CDs / DVDs and you will not have to be treated for more than a few years. of course you can also find CDs and DVDs in archivquality. of course you can also find CDs and DVDs in archivquality. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 this is a lifetime of 100 years for itself. if you believe it is in your refreshment area.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording equipment and they are not much more expensive than the cheaper, but you can write a lot of reliable. it rotates to the right to select.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for mistakes, even if you have just been written only. therefore, they use an inspection mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of data are only effective data, the rest is needed for the formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protection, it is needed by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a reasonable program called IsoBuster, but it runs under Windows and & Linux; but there is also similar applications available for Macs. there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to be able to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-player Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore virtually six times the capacity of a Dual-Player DVD with 8.5 GB. everything about CDs and DVDs was also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good capture device to high quality media in an unproprietary format. also you should watch the media with a description, date & author characteristics and after that protected place. do not forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy manufacturer keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer guarantees a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: floppy disk</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks keep the most common fault rate dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error-cause, SMART cannot terminate this error. some of SMART will terminate this error. some of SMART will terminate the error. these are particularly readers and publishing counter. the expected lifetime amounts between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to one power before you have secured the files, but these losses normally have to produce without problems without problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices are not much enough, these devices can take devices with computer chips and high-speed powers. these can cause serious data loss, hardware devices, motherboards and other defects. protect themselves from the inevitable loss that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed and remove the rest. it is normally available in the form of a plug-in bar. do not think that any plug-in strip contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that he guarantees the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also consider that it protects the protection against lightning.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since a overvoltage can use every cable to your computer, you should also make sure that all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers represent overvoltage guns also included a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these tools are especially designed for notebooks and therefore also contain protection for the modem. thus you are ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection your system protects your system before smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can result in a loss of indispensable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overvoltages, these devices can be automatically shut up and down the system. some models allow you to store your data up until the current. if you buy a UPS, you should make sure that they are the same quality requirements such as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare his security in electricity disorders with the cost to avoid these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think it is possible to keep all cables before you ride into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as the drive below & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can save any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, in comparison to the hard disks, you are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data about comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are available online storage services. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online. the professional variant offers you unlimited storage, which should be reviewed in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. data transfer errors are automatically included by the TCP protocol and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a stored storage. so they are desastersure.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are required for transmission errors. the filesystem support and btrfs at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive are safe.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody said to you if a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered that there is no protection for your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocols is a much safer data run than the on your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transfer losses because they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems these bugs remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems, you should see in the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems appears to be one of two candidates, which can handle and highly scalable. it is Open Source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that there is soon also for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still used in the alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that uses and is also available for & Linux; yet it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. if notebooks are already the proportion of theft 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the meiotic. it is currently limited to a lower damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently only very few viruses and under & Linux; there is already no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source file systems are less vulnerable for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process is avoided during a sudden break during surgery is higher and a undefined status is avoided before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras from digital cameras are 1-2 blending settings of fundamental physical limits. meant that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and spatial characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in direction of the 10 megapixels sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the final result rather deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats for higher resolutions.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is available today for 100 & euro. thus, make sure that your data is often affected by a data loss. for example, your data is often affected by a plan and test this backup before you are looking for something like the new installation of your operating system, replacing the exchange of boards or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then a day, a flash would be lucky enough when the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget aircraft intensity: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desastisation is always a local storage. bring your security up the stairs to the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above already said is a more common reason for a data loss despite the panic. if you use a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files are to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete data backup. this creates a complete Momentment to two periods: the complete backup and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. this creates a number of snapshots. you can re-use the original status at any time. this backup comes from a versioning system on the next, with the exception that it is not only trimmed and not continuing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool which can easily be addressed to your machines. in contrast to script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, only the difference of files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time you come back up with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment for each month. each additional extension should be done manually, after which you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, playback of pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years, that is about the time period in which you are interested in you because you are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable thanks to your nature, you must consider and re-rate everything today. unfortunately, there is no other way than to manage a certain wax. every 5-8 years you should ask ourselves as the current system is backwards compatible. if less varieties you have used in the past, it is easier to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system for reading your pictures, then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: once you change your computer architecture, your memory and secure technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay at open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the reference pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually the way to enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge it onto a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and send it to a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check out with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but they are not hanging.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the record is / dev / sdc1 # at the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if a day no software can be read, then you can create them. this task is easier for year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard, but it can save as much more. it is reliable, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can use a relative many administration information, but not as many as you need and a slow compression. this format is to you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). a problem is however that this format has been adapted to many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open frame format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handy camera manufacturer DNG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, in order to replace the XMP technology, to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a identification technology that allows users to create your data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers put it in front of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive archiving. XMP fits as it records the metadata separately from the image file and the image file is simplified. therefore you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that support the work on a wide range of application and business models. to the activities of DCMI communities, discussions and community work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard compounds and educational efforts to achieve a far acceptance of metadatenstandards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert Rohfiles to DNG and store this in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">In order to use external programs you can use external programs. if you check the pictures again with & digiplug; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleries, add in mpeg, use the contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into & digiplug. in section Adding a photos to an album you will find a description, as you can have already installed on your hard drive, but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use the digital camera with & digiplug; connect this with the machine, turn the camera to display mode and turn them. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, the camera tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is manufactured, a distance indicator will appear at the lower end and the pictures of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, filenames and a symbol of file extension for each file, photos, movies, music etc on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the lateral features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of a single entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file features and the photo information that are internally stored by the camera. a symbol shows that the picture was not yet downloaded from your computer. note that some digital cameras are not available to all information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer remarks, GPS etc of the image. these information are the same as in the metadata side bar from the main window of & digiplug; or the picture processing. note that these metadata must not be available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer, is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from all of your camera into a single album in & digiplug. the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are safe in an album before you delete photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired selection methods of & kde; select the photos you want to download and then download the button. download the button to download as long as you have selected photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is available for download. these pictures have not been downloaded from & digiplug. in this case, the new pictures are selected using a star in advance window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the buttons All download or selected, a dialog appears to be displayed in which the photos will be stored in which the photos will be sorted. details on folder sorting can be found in section My albums. choose the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; the photos of the camera load on the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos you can delete them from the camera. if you want to delete all of you, if you want to delete all the button, you need to select this first and delete it to delete selection.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no possibility to restore the photos deleted by the camera; you should not check if the photos were successful in one & digiplug; you should be carefully delete if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera memory, you should make this much faster than the camera version.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames not especially meaningful names. the file names are usually deleted after the photos from the camera. this can be meaningful if you have taken photos of various samples in the same album. therefore, it may be meaningful to integrate the date and time, in which the image has been done to the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for datory underlines. if you use this latter option, a file is created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transmission opens three further options that are carried out before the photos on the plate are stored. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another data format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M. if you have the option to add the date & time. for further reasons you should read the help of the command time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you have the opportunity to change the file names in lowercase. or in uppercase letters if you prefer to use it.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug; for a photo, is displayed below the name, the camera is displayed in preview. their settings are stored and automatically used when you can open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">Digiplug and digiplug; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that has embedded your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digiplug; the photo in the original box, use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made information about the date, at which the photo was made available, you can use & digiplug. all images with the same date are loaded into the picture album. all images with the same date are loaded into the picture album. not all cameras can be found in the picture page nometa data you can read what information can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case stores & digiplug. if you want to change this option. if you want to change this option, use the button extension and select the option based bottom bases at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their computer to your camera is the button Download. select the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that can be uploaded. you can also select more than a file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug; you'll see where the pictures will be highly loaded. choose a folder selection dialog for the camera. choose the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position that can be displayed in length and latitude. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an aircraft using automatic recording of the GPS data to cartographing. environmental planer, military, police, architecture offices and estate agencies you can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten the photo, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious; users want to locate the place of the photos, it is easy to document the position of the photos of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a editing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical mapping (manual) and last via manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit. but there is a few that works with GPS receivers. either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Download the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbak. you need to save this data in GPX format, as it is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract data from pictures and from the GPS and correlate. on the following page you can make the same name & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard-didacy and urges-legal data. these data will be selected automatically into the relevant IPTC data fields when it is written for downloading from the camera plate. these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autocation is a synonym for the author: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. these can be named as mentioned photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is an additional description of the author, this also must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this is not the author, if this has been registered for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press; if the picture is a storage photo, then the group or agency should be the picture available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the corresponding IPTC rim. thereby, the metadata permanently are contained in the picture and not only available in the database of & digious; these metadata are available to other programs and can be imported into & digious; imported without being lost without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image acts as embedded as embedded (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos, with the images embedded in pictures. attention: in pictures, those who are already confisoned are written by the rate of & digious.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page contains all the options for the information displayed if the mouse pointer in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is indicated or not.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by clicking the button Update right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lightness of & digiplug; can be turned on this page to the default values. some pictures have however enabled different sizes and the synchrone mode. if you have any different sizes and the synchronous mode, you should only use it for fast computers. if you have one, then you can obtain better evaluation results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can choose this here. you can switch the toolbar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and lower areas of a picture can be marked with darker or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the picture processing, this picture can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, the images in a higher resolution of the luminance can be coded as in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression, which means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF TIFF compressed you can switch the Deflate -compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF. it has no influence on image quality since the Deflate algorithm is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files you can freely save the loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digious, the picture processing is only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it has been developed very quickly to a tool for manipulation your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard deviation is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light as the pixels with odd lines. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option shows a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the camera is used to use the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white level is not set. default is a fixed color balance that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that undercut images in four steps more details in the Spitzines. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top, so the parts of your images are integrated to consider as piercing white in the settings. use the setting of pierced white in the settings. at last, use the top quality in various roses. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the hairy information.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. & digiplug; and dcraw are trying to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option you select the option to set a level. this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you'll probably need him to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1. this can also be made later to the image options of & digious; to keep the time for the demo version, you should have conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A denosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial speed data, which provides many cameras and the Matrix color pixel is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or paint construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives to you: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. according to some tests it was used as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm that was used by myself. it creates color scheme on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color of your lenses you can see the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you will be performed during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">One profile translates the color information and returns instructions like those given back. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information as the color information from one color space in the others are to translate the colors as exactly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile folder Sit here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles. & digiplug; examined this folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management screen is an alternative opposite Xcalib or argyll. here are only your images colourless not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be customised to the camera manufacturer and model which you are using. not all profiles are produced on the same type. currently, dcraw Gamma does not contain conversions at 16 bits of depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the soft-prox profile, which you can emulate, as your printer can be back again, because your printer can work a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated, rather than you can rely on blind algorithms of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obviously what colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together. this response is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portraitand S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is a interface that can support from a series of & kde; image quality and image processing, which can support & digiplug; many modules have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. choose which you want to use and these are then uploaded by & digiplug. these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu and beyond, you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the menu below settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) over KIPI modules can be found via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugg.org or in the manual books of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The attaching of the sealing should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image inputs, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other fields turn off the metadata, or the lower end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features indicate a list of all cameras supported on the left side. if you want to use a camera which is connected to the computer, make sure the camera is connected properly, switched on and in the image mode. there are currently serial, USB- and USB / FireWire-mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field will only be active if you have a USB- or FireWire-mass storage camera from the camera. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt, specify when you enter your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">In order to connect your digital camera with & digiplug; you need to connect the camera to your computer and switch them into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digiplug; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set your camera, your camera will appear in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is shown in the menu of the main menu. if you own more than a camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for shifting &gt; images in the trashcan you can set the talk of & digiplug. in the deleting of a photos in an album, you can find further details in the sections of a photos and deletion of a album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be shut down through & digiplug; apply if you use the option changes in the right side bar without relapse. otherwise you need to apply the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also sign the display of the welcome images of & digious; starting to start. this will accelerate the starting process of & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting at the start after new photos are forced & digiplug. this extends the start time of & digious albums. this extended the starting time of & digious. this extends the starting time of & digiplug. this extends some out of the base file, ask & digiplug it is intended to delete it out of the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be used in & digious; used to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can choose from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be shown below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digiplug; you can find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can view it to view your photos and improve the correction and improvement. image processing can be done by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of preview displays / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The Image Processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of which are available as modules in & digious; you are not part of your distribution. other information on the KIPI modules can be found in section Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the lower edge of the window, the filename, current record number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the upper edge and including the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of image processing change your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo before you use the Save or button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should be able to produce a copy of your image before you can change it. you can save them with file saving.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by re-restore or use the button button reproduce in the toolbar. you lose any change in the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any promotion of image processing can be restarted or restored. the last action can make you back, by selecting editing and restore operations, choose from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should get the shortcut abbreviation, Ctrl; -z to restore and utilize Ctrl; -umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you choose the & LMB; over the return / re-button button in the toolbar a moment, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions are made between also reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start the image processing you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation system in the toolbar, picture high, picture rbelow or the entries in the menu file, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo in and out in which you can use Ctrl; mouse bike or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the safer menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: adjust the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you do not want to use the Esc button. if you do not want this, you can call this in the setup dialog of & digious; you can call it out of the & digious window. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture you can print in the menu image and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or entire phrases. all pictures are printed out of your selection. you will only select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Printing. if you follow the assistant, you will need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which is important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation coil, also available in the image processing, and it will be displayed if one of the five riders are clipped:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same riders the sidebar will appear or disappear again into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view you can enter labelling with unlimited size or add. note the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off and special characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling in other applications, you should follow these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented it, use either the button user or change to the next picture, the labelling will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, this will always be done when you choose a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows a evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard-breviation Ctrl + 0... 5. in order to rate multiple pictures at the same time, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field of urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box for filtering the keyword, the keyword and a selection box with previously mentioned in this & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search phrase. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering the keyword in a picture series. if you have entered different passwords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Passwords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all tags of a picture are stored into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar will be used with their album, - data, keyword, and viewfinder. if additionally a or more sample filter is used from the right side, only the cutting volume of these two passwords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and retrieve several pictures in the main screen. if the keyword exists, you can simply drag them from the right side bar and put it on the selection. subsequently a dialog appears that you asks whether you want the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is selected on no keyword. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and afterwards, a keyword from the right keyword tree were drawn up and then filed. a dialog asks whether this keyword is supposed to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at each start of the program. you can also use different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it must be one or his should be, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to which in the database is sought. this may be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can define an extended search through all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you will need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then follow the knob. see the options as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have primarily adapted to & digiplug; s specifically adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you enter a colourless workflow is the prevalent deviation from your camera or scanners, you can reach the colors on your monitor using your camera or scanners. using the colors, you will print or publish the colors that are available from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic is coming to paint management, everyone wants to press what buttons he must press for the results which he wants. unfortunately, color management meets the results of this tutorial on each point of image management. additionally, you should make links with deeper information making your own informal decisions to make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image has been accomplished every six below, then you must not take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You can work on a monitor that can be calibrated on the sRGB color space. (more information please see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other images are by e-mail or web, where sRGB der de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works well and the life for all that's easy, why should you use another color space and make sure to make thoughts regarding colour paste?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we really see is presented at the bottom. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the husisenshaped region, and the colors in the RGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB using some larger colour modes, visit Bruce Lindbloom and click on info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to kiss my monitor if I decided to work only in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the RGB colour space or not you need your monitor kallibriers, because sRGB works on sRGB kallibrim. if you are working as the color space of sRGB, then you need to use your monitor to the RGB-standard kallimounts, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, same, automatic and contrast enlarge from the menu correcting automatic correction automatically try to experiment the best. they will be able to experiment with this effects, which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scaled with the entire picture, so the dark point black and the brightest item is as bright as possible without changing its color shady. this function is often a magical correction for pictures the dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">To the same: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the selected image, so that the histogram range has the same number of pixels. sometimes it achieved very good results with the improvement of a picture, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either miracle of a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes color range in red, green and blue channel. they determines the dark and bright border tones, and adjusted the red, green and blue channels to the entire history.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enlarge: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by postpone of the lowest and highest values of all values between. this is only visible with balanced images and may be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white defleece of & digiplug; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white off of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white compensation correction is slightly restricted to a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can perform a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can perform white abbreviation in the raw mode, which in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction are better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white equivalent algorithm that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it with the menu entry colors white off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side both the original picture can be adjusted as well as the preview of the target image. if you want to see the original whitance, then it is enough to click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the coefficient of Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, most pixels very small luminance values. with a button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and Gamma. the shade adjusts the shadow details of your photos better or down dimming.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above checks are used, you should use the color temperature Pipette. press this button and then click on the image preview for calculating the color temperature of white and white. on this type, the temperature and green -values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white compensation with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed dicator increases the colours if more than a colour channel of Pixels is overexposed. you will be displayed the combined result in white. this will be displayed as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons store as and shop make exactly this. each setting of the white equalizer you have set to store this into a text file and later returned.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button Preferences sets out all the filter values again to their standard values and associated neutrals. note that also neutral settings can be found another photo as your original. if you store this, your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the far widespread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high quality images. this coding needs more plate, computing time and is available only for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiled. colour toner can be carried out by the sub-window for the use of color profiling, you can pull the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to make it possible for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always do the same error, and therefore you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the sound correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure problems is the tool to gradation that you find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects provide you four farms, a solar efficiency effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solaratier also called Sabatier, a effect of which was partially completed and completed the development of the image. this was the effect that the brighter areas of darker and the colors have been inverted. the result was a partial negatives of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase creates a negative image that is not produced on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation, that he makes a stronger countereffect that makes the colours brilliant and smooth. try it simply, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for daylight optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated fatty colors are also some photograph, especially those who hardly find landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neonlight on the counteredge. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the Neonlight. in large pictures, the filter can overload the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to modify the colour contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can experiment with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adings can be satisfied in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the converted problem: a good saturation. even in this case, the tool is to increase saturation instead of increasing. all changes you can view it in preview. if him do the result, you can confirm the changes to Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple leukite / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound correction for improving the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of sliders. specifically the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphics of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs, three slider can be clicked on the picture and the left hand represents the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to control the operation is to postpone the knob and make sure that the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left hand, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted whether the histogram is dominated by a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images the vast areas of a constant color is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic scale of useful is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the medium for bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, commonly called Gammaids.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colorimpettes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used in order to evaluate the output values for example. the compression of the output values can be used for example, while using something different in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values will be set automatically depending on the intensity values of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system are stored and later charged later. in addition, Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input values will automatically be adjusted for all shadows, medium and solar sound. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original version of the Histo, Green, Blue and Luminanzkanäle.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option covers all color channels to find overexposed Pixel and gives you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side the half of the original and the target screen is indicated. the preview is updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this tilting there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logical view. for pictures which have been recorded with a digital camera, usually the linear mode of a constant color produces a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode will continue.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a shortwave to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that this bright tones can be correspondent with darker scissors and corresponding to the corresponding pixels of a dark.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos you can see a red mark on the range you want to change a matching line on the turn, which is the original value. create a point on this line and move it down to your taste until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and store: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. every curve that created you can be saved in the file system and later charged. the file format is the Gimp short-format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you use this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the shadow, central and sunny sound. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option covers all color channels in order to display overexposed pixel. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. here is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that has been corrected in the LuminanzCanal. shadow and suntones became used with the color pipette and applied on the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug; Image Processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the colour shady photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is a further developed tool to mix the shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be regarded as comparison of your own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for Red, Green and Construction allow you to activate this channels if you also activate the corresponding color components. this is especially convenient when you also use the appropriate color components. this is especially convenient when you also use the appropriate color components. try to reduce the green channel-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible noise that occur in the same place in the colour channel and whose noise is different from each channel. if that of the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion thereby in which you need to reduce the farbrauschen.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer setting can therefore store up to later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option covers all color channels to find overexposed Pixel and gives you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is readjusted. the option is activated under (1) and the picture shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating due to your precinability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step where colour pictures can simply be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good at all scenic images and fits especially well to portraits against heaven. like the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orderly filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates a dramatic celestial effects and can simulate Mondliquefied at the time of time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) rotates.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this creates hot bright and medium tones during a little cold in the sattaines. this is very similar to the process of a pressure and redevelopment in a septic valley. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Digiplug and digiplug; tool textures can apply decorative textures to one image.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your image, regardless if it is a color screen or not, you can look like an oil painting on a screen, an pop portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used to use the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the registration of the depth or three dimensional characteristics of the texture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textureffective has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and changed under (2). the relief of relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Digiplug and digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an indication in the limits of a photos is not easy task. a possibility to keep its attention to the image. this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye. under the frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you enter the desired frame type for your picture. immediately converted the picture with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images) with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttonhole and decoratively adds a decorative frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: is the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is bigger than the original, but the original aspect ratio will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially when you cut the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture of any matter. this is also possible at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. use text, orientation, color from the color space and the character set to adjust. the larger image, the larger must be the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already the picture is done.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting which you have chosen for your text can be changed until you enter the button "OK." after the image has been stored once, the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">Digiplug and digiplug; Tool Templates which you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Image template use in the image processing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">To encil template, there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format and you should add a maximum compression of the template. whom you want to add an e-mail in English to the & digiplug; mailing list digiplug-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time you need to set your template folder with the button folder in dialog. choose the folder where you will notice the template folder. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for templates, a building view is repeated, which automatically reflects the folder of the stencil folder. the selection of a folder has been updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">The preview of three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and change the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarged the displayed picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resized the button: this knob resized the lower picture. if you want to use the template's position. if you want to keep the template on the whole picture, you need to cut the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply template on your image. the picture will then be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">Digiplug and digious; presents three different tool for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, produces, especially in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to be a picture of sharpening. in fact, it is not a bit of psychovisual. you can use it to avoid atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refokuskusis possibly the best of the three, because he really improved the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in his application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalised images need a correction of sharpness. this means that sharp edges has to be put together into a common color. this means that sharp edges are printed on paper. SLR cameras will usually need more than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures often have been applied to a camera internal sharpening. pictures in the shell format must always be used during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpic filter already during the setup of the image. if you disable this, get your control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by using a photo with the sharpening value of sharpening. this allows you to correct sharpening of the menu.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should also deal with this, since the results will not work much: the sharpness of the edges, but strengthened the noise. in general, the usable technique is improved to sharpening a picture on the menu entry. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too cute. the solution that allows a bit soft to sharpening. use the tool for turnout softness and experimenting something with the menu entry. the preview window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter resurred is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values produce good results and should be tested first. if you make the imsharpest mask to strong, become noise and impression of grate in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels that are affected by the filters are affected by the filters. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore sharpened pictures at their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the caught image one of the original is added. this makes the sharpness of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and the difference between the difference. you can therefore define a minimum difference between the tones of sharpening and therefore beauties errors in mind, heavens and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unblurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the working image has been applied (2). unsharp masked with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug is focused on the tool and focused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright infringement-protected design algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create a picture to & quot; refokussierquot; it is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. it usually uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. it usually takes better results as inblurred. you can start using colors Refocusa in the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular split is much better than the Gauge's folding. the Gauge's folding has a very long tail, which are far away from the original pixel pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauge's folding is even influenced in most cases even very strongly affected by the remote pixels. preventing them undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but then on the edge of the sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help poverty. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the room filter can help you reduce Artefakte. however, values higher than 0.1 is very rare. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value specifies the size of transformation matrix. if you choose great results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauge's sharpness. however, please note that the module should select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any reproduction parameters will be stored for later and then can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, colour and intensity correction on the picture before installing the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately, but they left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compress pictures, & eg; when JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masked better results as sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masked a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to produce unsharp masked. even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the unsharpness. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the insharpness mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better for processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due on insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for sharpectual structure in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob glass sets the unsharpness of the area of the dark, in order to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinent allows a adapted color for the pupil. if you want a blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The picture error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Involalgorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as strong points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed electrostatic p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a smooth glassment on the picture. a value of 0.9 should be checked for details so that no sharpening must be inferior. please note that detail, please note the details of the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Angle dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smooth even in all directions, while a value close to 1 is only in one direction. if you have a film grains or CCD smokers will create a high value of equal value. JPEG Artefakte will be eliminated at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value therefore suitable to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter applies to larger structures. this is necessary to estimate more than a lot of space, since it's hard to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, he needs to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle progress [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected, there should be also small. make sure that small angle use a long runtime. you should choose this value so much as possible and for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated stride length [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should avoid the value of smaller than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More of quality that you get through the selection of this option is only small. it doubles, but we recommend it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons store as and shop make exactly this. any setting of image error can now be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Visual error correction is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can break the calculation at any time with the button downturn.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors be removed with small artifacts. the module is made in a photo that was done in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is an independent black artifact that caused by a bad film storage while the journey is worm.The original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool offers selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove the senses from the camera or moire; -Effects of saved images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor space of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot shown above shows a typical scene showing a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a giant noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the window windows and the sub-window setting can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, ranging from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filters a pixel are moving across the picture and the colour in it is smoothed and thus smaller flaws at local currency.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch setting up the filter back to the front. if it is increased, the adaptive filter image details does not need to obtain any more and noise from the level. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and crack.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole room can be removed or smoked. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak pirates or JPEG artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the picture. we recommend either color or luminance to improve the image. these settings does not affect the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to modify either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings does not affect the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas, which typically are stronger, however, it is polluted the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phasenjittering. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges are smoother. if it is too high, noise and phasenjitter appear on the edges. he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set, can be stored into the file system and later charged.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the fixed with (2) and the noise reduction was applied to default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a painting is very easy for your purpose. the solution, the image is a bit soft to sharpening. don't use tool for turnout using the menu entry and experimenting with the glass. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools in the most far developed tools to reduce photgraphic files.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts. it is very well adapted to remove Gaudi's pirate, film grains, scratches, compression standards, scratches, compression and subsequently digitalized images, too. the smoothing occurs along the image contours and therefore gets the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the error correction is developed with another tool, the error correction was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannoses and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a deserted compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; - small standards which are displayed in uncompressed image. this setting should correct this problem.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons store as and shop make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored as a photo with equal noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grazing on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures has been read on an old color photo taken with a scanner. you can see the scan arm that caused by Scannerillumination and the photopapier. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; Tool Hotpixels allows you to remove Hotpixel from photos using a CCD camera, eight were removed too. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly suitable for high quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the assistants with the button dark image. the tool will recognize the hot and bright pixels that are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to discover the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the matching dark image to correct image. please note that the assistant remembers the last dark image and reload this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image field and preview can help you correct within the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted up in all inventories.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defectives pixels on the preview and the results of the filters. choose the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the following filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: there is an average of the neighboring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel pitch will be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) and then used to interpolate the defectives pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to a pixel block are moved to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) to interpolate the pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less is moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the defectives pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, used. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug error correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, a picture to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, often cannot reduce the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) to achieve the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto objective show under circumstances also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lens should also be used, also with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unsharpen effects arise through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large platter ranges of today's fillet and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter, which without these filters, the transformation with a Centerfilter is applied to one image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves you can control the vignetical correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light reinforce in the point of the greatest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, or randomly to compensate a luminous intensity of 2, or random to compensate a greater degree of vignetting, reducing it to a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukthickness, contrast and Gamma settings: the editing of a picture with the vignetical correction is reduced the luminosity of the pixel. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controller must only increase positive values because you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more sensitive re-adjustment of the target image, then let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the Gradation from the & digiplug; Image Processing from the menu Color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettification correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct image. a photogram and contrast correction was also done with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; Linsenic distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a urgy protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient is treated by the general geometric distortion of lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar effects, but eight on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of stress corrects the remote corners to the second place of Grades. if you combine these two geometrical distortion, almost eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general, this value controls the strength of the distortion second Grades. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values are crushed distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth Grades. this value appears stronger than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter turned the sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus performs the correction of first grades due to negative values while positive the image resized.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you get the best filter settings, illustrating the dialog box with a preview of the distortion. the values use the values for your image are stored and used for the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons and circulation-shaped correction should be performed before all assignments or size changes. if you have new correction than all the first through. if you have a picture to cut, and then perform a tons-shaped correction would be the effect of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you get the best correction to you will find this tool a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot. in connection you can correct the tonnage / kissenic distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you corrected a cold distortion is the resulting image black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformers, remove from the image processing or about the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tons-shaped correction are sufficient for some pictures, e.g. photos from front, frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand, you always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulate infrared film of the GennGura.org website. the filters reproduced the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IIR film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left hand side of the window you can select the range for a preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters of film grains and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the grading texture of a highly sensitive film simulate the amount of film grains and the dominance of the green green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels for reproducing infrared film mixes, particularly the green canal makes it possible to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared filmeektes applied on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the displayed picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of Aura in the hairpin.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains like e.g. B / W Kodak Tri-X, known as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the films to increase the manufacturers of large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film effect effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere of your daily life. if you like this special, Gallery-like, street photo, especially in your monochroman photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the body. the default value is needed, even higher values are needed, at ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film grained effect on a black / W picture. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">S & digiplug; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a major protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to affect this effect. the upper selects the pin size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. glassment controls the gluten, or from the other side, the hinoculness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the image is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and gluten 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon dioxide. therefore, images whose gradients are slowly change. it is helpful if you choose what scene you choose to skate. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controls choose the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast (gluten).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal-label filter. the original image (1) and the modified picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving puts your image in 3-D when it was stamped on wax. it uses an urgy protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to give up your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially good in pictures with a simple structure, in which color does not use the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between paint and intensity to transform the image into a grey, Mongolian landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the used image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art work by distortion effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: share the image in cells and can look like if it is seen by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can stop this effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in an art plant with infinsharpness effects. it uses the copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Insharpness: wimate the picture along sternal lines coming from a center. this simulates the imsharpness of a zoomend camera and therefore generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radical unsharpness: wimingly the image by rotating the pixels around a core. this simulates the imsharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: wimingly to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharpness: distorted the picture by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the imsharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft-sharpness: wimingly the picture is soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and brilliant focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, Glamour photos or add a warm and subtilting light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttunsharpness: wimish the picture by random shifting of pixels and simulates the unsharpness of a arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the paddling pool in the image and widening them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by the filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time for calculating and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make Regentropes on your picture. thereby, there are natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn by copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Tropical size allows to change the size of the drops. since the tropical size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image, it is often required to reduce size and density of drop. fish changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; Image Processing has a range of free of regression. use the tool to set the range, e.g. a face that is free to stay free. if you start the filter regression, the area will stay free of regression.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropes Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the worked picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it by spike or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu Transformations Dreaming or Transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to increase a photo to a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to abstained is simple. the big question is how you can find a picture of bubbles and details? how can you be found in a picture? how can you get the missing information? how can you get the missing information here? how can you see a good job here, making it a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it onto the desired size with the tool size. select the size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog box is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool used to change a linear interpolation method to capture the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs are using a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must say to the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keeping aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, when entering the new size, the aspect ratio will preserve the original image of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter applies to larger structures. this is necessary to estimate more than a lot of space, since it's hard to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, he needs to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons store as and loading are used exactly. each entry for photo can be saved as text file and later to be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after moving. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by taking a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to cut a picture with the mouse simply just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and put on the rectangle, create. you will see this rectangle then move your mouse during your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you start the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. thus you will get a good overview as your photo into the cut. you can extract the size of the area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply drag them to the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting edge, use the push button button in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or file Save as in the menu file to store the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the field of view, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool after aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or transverse format. in the high format it is always assigned to the greater value of the height and in the transverse format of the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool according to aspect ratio is used. this means it is always equal, regardless of whether you are centimetres, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to make the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool according to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool, these settings are displayed as default values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data can be reflected in the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compositions allow help to create and create your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are a way to share a rectangle into the diagonals of the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a division established on different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blender leaves of a sunflower. it dives in all possible things to see you as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the error number 1,618033988... and it was used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you create your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number guides from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two previous numbers. the standing divider is 1: 1,618 the golden center. a composition measures will follow as a visual harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid aid lines when you create a picture. they are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will get your destination good results for your photos. in comparison to the third party, the golden spiral of the eye can follow the eye along the line of the spiral. this type of composition leads along the line of spiral design and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral, also called gold rectangles. it should be something that the eye can be used in the centre of the composition. this can be a line with or different objects. this is just to guide one line without the eye, it will be fulfilling his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also from the above mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equal to equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be found a static object of dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles in order to break your frame create a effect of professional photographic dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach any other.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options are reflected and vertical mirror can be reflected in order to mirror the harmonic submissions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. on this type, you can customize the colour of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate any angle around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens easy to keep the camera straight vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture to fix the camera to an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool-free rotation. choose this file extension and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide is set in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module has a horizontal and a vertical line at your disposal. move the mouse pointer to position the two lines. after you put it on an important point of the image, you can adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous sections.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is the function transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the function Automatic cut. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option of anti-aliasing smoothed the picture a bit after turning. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivan transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then be re-calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new picture, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new picture, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Right below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjustment of the perspective, the picture will polluted a little bit dirty. for individual adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments produce a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After that you have adapted the perspective you have unbearful triangular holes on the corners. a way to bersome is to cut the image with Transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the upper part into the opposite side. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted. with other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Note your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners. if you press horizontal and vertically at the same time, you can view the angle to zero. a preview of the effectiveness will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you use a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now adjust the mould tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out, the picture becomes a bit of neglect. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two chings generated twice as much as if you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After setting, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate this is the image with transformation cut out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">Digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats, therefore, depend on your system and, in some cases, from the type as these libraries are compilated. in most distributions you will be able to create a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to the dependency from other libraries, it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system. but you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">Digiplug and digiplug; only files in formats to the knows. if the expansion is listed in the list, & digiplug; the file in the list is displayed. you can change this list of file extension formats & digiplug. in the section configuration you can find further information on this list.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select to use files. a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images. the redundant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smooth results as JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store reliably if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw material format, you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can find raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the Rohmer converter from & digiplug. in the section configuration, you can find further information on the use of modules with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools that require the photo processing are included in & digious; included. their description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image processing power tools such as sharpening, turnout, noise suppression, irurred, & etc;. use a uniform dialog box before the filter is applied to the current picture. below you see & quot; texture run quot; in this dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress beam shows the status of the filter onto the current picture. five buttons to change the comparison chart of the precept. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="813">Choose the images that you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu on. the above-looking dialog appears. to download a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to download a track file with GPX file, of course, which contains data from the same time to the same locations, as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file uploaded a automatic correlation, the coordinates must be recorded in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore must be converted to GMT time with the time zone. this can be set up with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum deviation for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera-time. the deviation among them will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place for images you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference between 2000 seconds will then be related all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used, if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality, place a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set this boundaries here and then press the knob to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog is to use a call for next, you will only use the button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be displayed with the displayed map and enlarge it. select the appropriate region and enlarge it again until you have reached a sufficiently precision. the card can always be selected manually, and the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodier can be used to convert selected images in a MPEG-video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the Diaschau. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can only use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You need to insert the pictures which are packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can start using an extras MPEG slide show.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the pictures or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. if you're using a TV format, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD file, you need to choose the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. a low value generates very sudden, a high contrast of very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should leave it black. the name and the path of the generated file can be fixed under the name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file in the name of the audio source file, so it is integrated into the movie. after all the settings can start your requirements, you can now go quickly or enjoy a coffee in all the rest of your computer, and enjoy the Diaschau when you're back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that coders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick Packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows you to print several pictures on a sheet paper in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Image Processing Gimp. this is convenient to make you better or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can convert your in RAW format stored images in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line-tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original score of Him is: expect from dcraw not to get the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file converting to convert and start the module. the Raw image conversion window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides, if the camera settings can be used for white or equal. the essential parameters such as Gamma, brightness and Red / Blue amplifier can be adjusted optimally. if the result is not optimal, you can process the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview you can choose one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG is used a reliable algorithm and produced for the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, reserves all information of your image and use the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to use your images too or later, you should not use the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality has deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose to JPEG as a memory format, the metadata file formats are included in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, you can use it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image that the best settings are.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, this is the possibility to automatically write an existing file. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available as far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for rename all images of a album. you can put the prefix, starting numbers and timestamp.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can reduce the image or enlarge it 4 types of image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in dimension. width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option to adjust your image to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non proportional: non proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio will be changed for this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepared the picture for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the pressure resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, Randomsize and background color, is accordingly adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. there is also possible to change the size of the larger images previously. more images can be put to the list of those pictures and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the pictures will be displayed with the selected images. over the button pictures you can add a further images with a file selection dialog. for the last chosen picture will be displayed a preview on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the picture list and add them to the list of leading images.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button photos, the selected images are removed from the list of the leading pictures.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you can open all the pictures you can open the new message -Window of your e-mail clients. you'll need to add here only the addresses and the subject. the pictures are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many pictures at one time. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of the relevant e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send a lot of pictures when you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings of the images. your configuration will be saved and once again used until you change it.</seg>

<seg id="917">& B studio album; provides you two possibilities available to create HTML pages with your images. one is available in & B album; integrated and the other as module is available (see). in the following part of the user book, the integrated version is described, which can create over the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are described in the three areas of content, layout and finish. in the following table every area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First you enter the title of the superflucks and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photoelectric album; HTML-sample pages you can see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & B album; export File can be created, which is to be seen on the review page. née information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Recently, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed without any description. for example, all pictures of a party are. note that all pictures are exported. they cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define as the HTML page will look like. most of the setup possibilities are clear, why it is not done specifically for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the page you can view different resolutions for the images. by this, those who have to view your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures for example, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer at your site can change the resolution at any time. it can therefore browse your images with low resolution, well as well. if he has shown a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, place the different folders and the URL to your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically supplemented by the next time. this allows you to select a folder or by KDE supporting protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check this really all of the viewer. if you have created a URL for the basic file, the URL that you have created here should be the file. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you have not need to copy them in the final target folder, see how right works you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described options are related to the three to basic folders or URLs. in these, a sub-file is created, whose name is set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a meeting at a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & a little album; you can naturally create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, you can get a HTML page for viewing the pictures, recording place, etc., then you need to make with & B album; this work must not be done once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & B album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others in your database. the picture teams are importing and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. you can distinguish whether the images are stored in file or whether in file it is only a link to pictures. the advantage of all images added together and this file is so independent. the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can choose a .kim file either directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images to two times. first, the images of the URL, which are specified in the file of the .kim file. this is naturally only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog will be described for exporting images you can read about the menu file Export....</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog box is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are you the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When selecting the .kim file, you'll need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option to copy and copy the .kim file, the pictures are automatically copied to you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to compress this, just select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is possible to limit maximum image size. if you do not send your friends images, because the .kim file is otherwise very large. here you can limit the size by clicking that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file using the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select a few clicks and import the export database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import is made up of four steps. first you need to import which pictures you want to import, then in which file the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category of persons who is to be imported to the imported file (if you are a file) while this category is asked for your database. therefore, you will be imported into the third dialogue window that are to be imported in the third dialogue window, and what categories are to be imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can browse the categories of the data to imported file with the categories of your current database. an example on the picture you can see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to browse pictures and view: if you look at pictures, you would like to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend you would like to see all the pictures you see on which the friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps from (1) to find information on your images, through (2) the search and see, up to (3) advanced themes and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">The photo album has been started as a program for managing your pictures. it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual, more pictures have spoken, but often do this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& B album; stores all of its information in the index.xml file in the upper folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& B album; noted the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future Starts automatically. if you want to start a different folder with pictures, you can start a different folder with pictures, you can start & create a few folder; with the -c option. as an example: kicking album -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings can be set up in a window with which you can change to a window with which you can change the settings of & kdirect album; changing the various setup possibilities in the following section of the user book.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons with which you can setup the setup and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available to the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In this case you are described, as you can set various properties for each image, e.g. people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">In case you can see the dialogue, which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog box options you can set up complete members, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a mediator as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In case you can see the setup possibilities that you want to choose the category list. in the left hand side you can select the category. in the left hand side there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& B studio album; splits its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gweneview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. nferry informations you find on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called by the menu modules. the modules can be described and are not described in this manual as it cannot be distributed separately. most modules have a help hand over the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together with different applications, it may be possible to test the modules with & a slot; therefore you should always use the command line with the command &gt; kg Album -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or above the menu. don't say, I wouldn't have warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & a little album; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & a little album; and other applications that can use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported by albums; this kind of order is not supported, simulates some of the modules the order to albums, so that you can use the functions with & B album.</seg>
<seg id="962">There are simulated & funny album; the current album, simply the current view, so all images that show you the picture shows.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & B album must be handed over and handed over a list of albums. here you go to a record album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & B studio album; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all the people, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set up as a category for virtual albums. if you are using the category for virtual albums, so if you choose to select the category, so if you have selected people to view and to the module this.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & B album; not compatible, you can remove these from the list of modules. start with the setup dialog and select in the modules that modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see a sample for a starting screen once you start & cool album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see above a menu - and a tool bar. at the moment, we will find no information about your images. in the section we will find no information about your pictures, now, please click on the entry images, which shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & a little album; is the possibility to see any picture with comments on the picture where the image was taken, etc. you can also set any picture either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time. if the pictures are depicted on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures in Copenhagen were included.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsers as you can read in the section. if you want to see this remarks if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In case you can see three lists with a text box by taking up persons, places and words. these are a very important part of & a little album; because you will always use it again if you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the shifting of the pictures within the list: if you are depicted a family party, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are mapped, so that the used names are shifted upward, those people can find faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to list a alphabetical list, click the icon for sorting to date under the list.</seg>

<seg id="1025">Each object has as wire model a Visibility level. you can only specify this value relative to the visual level of the higher object or as absolute value. objects are only shown if they are selected or their viewing stage is smaller or equal to the scene of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler, has a window setting as default. the object tree and view of the object features are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window setting, or if you need a different arrangement, you can also adjust it arbitrary. you can also save several window orders and easily between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below one view, draw the facade to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">In order to create a new column, draw the facade on the right or left side of a view. the new view will be anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over one another, draw the appearance in the middle to another list. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card card reiter above in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views, which are not anchored in the main window. to view a view out of the fixing, drag the suit to the top left or click on the little left at the top of the arrow.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the address bar. to prevent the closing, click on the little square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add extra views into the main window. in the menu View, you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them on any one spot.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window order... save. it will be a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have produced a scene, you can renders them. & kpovmodeler, uses & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be installed properly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the icon Renders "icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode is equivalent to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add any amount of running modes, from a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or select menu View modes... select the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it's a name that makes the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to renders a small area of the image, select the checkbox section and enter the image section to the rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination quality you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections lighting. a detailed description of the Render features are found in the user manual of & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered by only one beam per pixel, there may be different mistakes. these pictures often have a Moirè-patterns or stufenders in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called Anti-aliasing in order to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, images can look better with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When switching anti-aliasing, compile and connect & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is great-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive method; adaptive because the super-sampling file extension refers to. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is further divided and adaptive because of calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray has to set up a beam of pixels. if the difference between pixel values to the neighboring pixels will be processed. if you are calculated using a specific number of pixels with super sampling, a grid of 4x4 is calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional radials per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference is divided into 4 sub-pixel, the pixels will be divided into 4 sub-pixel which can be pursued individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to aliasing the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changed & Povray; the radials around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The latest setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent if the associated beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window to display the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; choose the menu entry file importing... and select a file from the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler is currently not supported by & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window will show a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeler, write these sources between the two special comments / / * PMRawkin and / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can extract objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for & Povray; to import the source file in the editor file. to import objects into the scene, select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert in & cpovmodeler; and in your editor, you can also add the source code for & Povray; also included in your editor.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler is a scene. usually this povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">When you click on the help in the self-profit view, & kpovmodeler opens & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set here the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (e.g. altidddata) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files. if a file used in different paths of the library, the first spotted file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type markings.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object of points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotating.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects like the ball you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detailed projections, all wireless model views are further divided, all projections are used with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall there is a wall behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chess boards patterns made of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a bottom is below the objects. the floor is illustrated in a chess boards patterns consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you cross the edge detection method, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering scenes. the values for depth and swelling value can be adjusted. more information about parameters can be found in Section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window window orders, how you can create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window order: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler, uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of tant window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the knob and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and cannot be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below names shows all views of the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views with button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unedges you will get the window under the existing window, with map card, you will not be anchored in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler, installed and now you would like to start any more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all the steps in this tutorial, you should make the ultimate way simple scene under the beginner: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should remember the following warning, before you complain about it, that you can only use a black screen when you use a 3D program for the first time you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not have any camera, no rules for the rendering are applied, as a result, you will get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not add light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you will receive only one black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any faultless installed, you see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">These menus and symbols are often used now, therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler, starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you'll need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then choose the menu entry berries. thus you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera examines the whole scene, which you generate. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire-model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry containing the designation camera. if they click on it, see the contents of the View object properties, in which the various parameters of the camera will find. in user documentation about & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions, but note that the camera has to change the camera where you can change the target point of the camera. click with the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button user or the type of input, the wire-model views and object tree immediately change the settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for example. you could set a quader (insertion endpoint) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a true method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or the type of input. in the object tree the new name will be shown instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model program now shows the level, even though at the moment, just as a limited level. if you renders the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you see the object tree exactly, you will notice that you can see the entry for each new object. in this case you will see the standard options for each new object: scaling, spin and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get some of these parameters. choose shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Only select the floor to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a bit Easy.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box opens up in which you can select how the object will be inserted. then you can view the name in the object view (name = ground pigment), with one click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments only shows a mat black material because you can still enter the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview. you are now able to check the colors for pigment. also, there are many possibilities now, but take the easiest way now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you are looking in preview no color on Quader and ball, click on the button users and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now right now. if you are your image now with one click on the icon you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course they are not the color. you are expected to have a further settings. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do it more common, but the Schachbrett-color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree every time and change the colors in view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to execute the basic work of & kpovmodeler as you have already understood. the ball can be just like the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object characteristics, you can immediately change the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input) or push the button to the bottom. otherwise, the ball rotates above the ground as you move the ground down to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the Renders now gives a new result: as already before, the ball point appears like a mat black material. set in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now prove a material as already at the bottom, enter the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">First, choose the first object and change the name for example in ball pigment. click the ball of pigment, then select Insert and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach an interesting effects if you take time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness of shine-effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal is not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what you have & kovmodeler, which offers you. hopefully, you have already learned as much as you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render Method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you rayytracts, the Renderer hypothetical rays coming from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like fog can work. so the scene is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye, which you look at the scene. without a light source you can see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, every scene will need to be engerated, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">The usual file dialog allows you to select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opening a file. in default file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously made with & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is filed under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Scene in the last stored version is recovered. all changes have been rejected since the last storage capacity.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only select if you don't have any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the most recently reversed command. this menu entry can only select if you have used Beads back on site.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the appearance, the buttons and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the scanning technique. you can only change or add instructions with this option for & kpovmodeler; commands or new.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opening a dialog to the device of the toolbar. you can add to this option toolbox for & kpovmodeler; orders and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-map is a way to isolate harsh surfaces without any beehouse on the surface and without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a Bump Map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometrical forms which allows you to use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic body. these models are processed then to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, by application of a image file as color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuk show; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. application features a file browser that you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in either own window in size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuk show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can see with clicking on & LMBn; or the key return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether each picture will be displayed in an own window, or whether all images are always using the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, you simply type the first character of the data in your browser window. when a matching file is found, the file is highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde. in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed due to a lack of dependency. please check if all the modules are available and use the dialog, allowing the user to run, why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Rescue LoadError error =' Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is, for this script. 'kdialog --sorry "# {error}'" exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can quickly use them as a basis for your own scripts. you will quickly determine that the writing of scripts are relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amarok and Amarok. the simplest way is the use of the command dcop; that every KDE installation should be reached.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts allow the trigger of external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; is usually called dcop &gt; relatively easy to be called. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Parok; sends notifications to any current scripts. with this reason, strings to the standard input of scripts are written and accordingly respond to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events even if there is no use for this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to view the setup dialog. to store the saving and loading of the setup data each script will take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the workfolder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is played. the script could now retrieve & b; with DCOP functions further information regarding the new piece (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumetChange newvolume Signalizes a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customize menstructions: Submenu, Submenu, Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist. submenu and itemTitle will also be referred to, so that the script can be used to remove the clicked code script (Submenu) dcop amarok script eCustomMenuItem (Submenu, Submenu).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & runk; terminate, or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the Signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do. for example, use the saving of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks Script Administration can also install script packages that can be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2), which can also be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2), which may recognize the archive clearly as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension of the amarocscript. for this reason you should set your script packages right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main crept must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be detailed. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script page by & amarok; apply for your entry to kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful features and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK needs only the package of Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to install Kdelibs so installed (including the included programs, because & amarok; requires some of them to be compiled e.g. modules or scripts). we have a small guide on how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD is ahead that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedesop.org. Gnome is thus working, but Fluxbox will help difficulty. we try to use amaroK on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these represent an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files will take an error in the TagLib library. you can view this error to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org and hang them the kaputte file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly, it is said that Taglib when reading the Meta-Info from this file crashing. please report this error to the daily Lib developers below bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. the support for this in & amarok; is something mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & amarok libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if B. & amarok, with GCC 3.4, Taglib was compiled with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to crash when working the meta information.</seg>

<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backpacks by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a common crash and send us a good backdrop, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is due to write a lot of program data as UTF-8 into the Meta-Info, but not as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "file $argv [0] does not exist -f $argv [0]); my $v2tag = $argv [0]); my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; Get _ v2tag; print" error when writing the tags of $argv [0]\ 'sold $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1488">DCOPref createMovix.Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () ClCOPRef currenteMovixDVDProject () bundled copyDvd () sold-format Dvd (), burnCdimage (KURL url), burndvdimage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result such a createXXXProject method, one can generate a DCOP reference to the newly created Project: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project received by # dcop K3b K3binterface currentProject. by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the top-listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is applicable only on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">The createFolder (QString Name, QString Parent), addurine (KURL:: list URLs, QString Parent) bundled eItem (QString path) bundle renameItem (QString path, QString, name) key setVolumeID (QString path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b) createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addateFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addateFolder / foo dcop / home / truthful / guaranteed file.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; check-out for & kde; with him can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audiocreator; the user interface of cdparanoia (compressed) is supported by cdparanoia (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression) must be added in terms of Linux distribution). more coders can be added to the program (if installed are installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per tracks) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is compiled by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for OGG) must be installed (for OGG) or other coders. all these programs are already available for any Linux distributions, but it is not necessary to compile it. if FLAC cannot be used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format should be used? the chapter of Welcher Kocher gives a small introduction to Kodierer, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia is not possible to read any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device is not possible to handle any copy protection; even not the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup must be made only once (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found), after reading a & CD; it leads (hopefully) to understanding the slim approach of the user interface that you will be proud in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which costly programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can get & CD; information from freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands for the orders. on the side step by step example, there are more information as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB on request of the CD-data is based upon request in the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online), in the latter case the connection must be made to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the setup tab in the setup index - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read from another encoder as the default. it's to be aware that before the Encoder has been configured in tab settings for setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that a new file to encode is selected instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, Piepsen) for Programmes (like reading the & CD; terminate).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with different card maps (such as Encoder, for setting up the Encoders). you have to go before the program can successfully be used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, coaster and compression rates and helps you choose the correct coerator's choice.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' hormones' or 'Monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information by data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG mag can have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important because both coders are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O ''not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrate.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is supposed to be heard from a calculator or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG formats are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also available on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these tools can only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting makes good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all the pieces of a title. good pleasure for music by young people, portable devices and autostereals. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you are absolutely absolutely highest quality, but if you want to keep the absolutely highest quality, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, manually entered or by the program automatically from the freedb via the internet are available as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & audiocreator; and the code program for creating folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with code programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the coders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodierers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the keyword (english: day) add MP3s with lame, the switch -tt must be added to lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which people can read / enter information, so that all other information can download and enter the machine. it's to note that here only by text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Annie des Uebereaster: this is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent them on the & CD; more or less valuable, thus cannot be added to the artist nor to the music company damage. all information can be found in a Bummel by a & CD; shop, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address will not be used during the retrieve of the server (This can only know the programmer which has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; used to use freedb, the geographic on the next sitting mirror server is needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servern for online orders of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (normally created) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which check-out program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to store WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumours that cdparanoia is used, looking at the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see. note that the cdparanoia package will be installed first if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the converted WAV files, the coders can be selected and so the desired file format can be selected. during the first opening, defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compressing for audio data) can be added on the tab. other coders can be added on this register card.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Koditer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used. more information on coders can be found in the chapter of Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a Kodierers, more information on his switches can be obtained through the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console), it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many reasons. check the device of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to run both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a hint that is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the sheath of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter by step by step for example. even if you use other settings, this tips can give as you proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, however, are still insecure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you'll get enough information that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to start all and our first & CD; we will be able to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 Keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You have to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution as it can be found as non-free software. anyway, it's not necessary to compile the source file, what you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy anything in the cross-sections).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something is thought to be done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD; which must be repeated for each recording & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we specify the code for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). as we are lazy to use the program, we can share the program using the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Even though we can change these settings at any time, we will probably change it with any reading of a & CD; change when the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be delivered to the reading program that can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cSyndrome is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed, so a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card value General settings are not much to do here. here you can define an additional conversion. in our example, everything will be shown so as in screen picture is shown.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, please note that you will be informed if information on texts by keyword (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and allow the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading of the & CD; connected to the Internet so that he can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selective field is simpler, a & CD; entry is found immediately, when you are insatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or day entries, they can easily be changed with the database entry and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to manually enter the selection fields and freedb, if you want to download the database in offline mode, if you're using the database, you need to check this twice as it's worth it. to get freedb in the open mode, the two selection fields must be selected at least the first. the mode will be set on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the information request, for the retrieve of & CD; information from freedb-server on the internet. how does the system that data will get the CD? read the section above freedb. set all this as it is shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and look after a mirror server at your proximity. on this way the load between the host is distributed and this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function work as well as many Firewalls of the protocol 8880 standard, there are perhaps more luck to the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want no & CD; data to the freedb server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from screen photograph. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously roaring pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with an existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author knows not to try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom files for temporary files: if you cross it, then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored. this is not enabled, the files will not be enabled in the private folder, if you don't forget this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All in this way, as it is on screen photograph. the order is somewhat long, under circumstances you need to see anything to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting rate is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of creation of tags on version V1 / V1.1st 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted on demand. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Do the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to coiled WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic device of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; used. if you choose the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of check-out of the & CD; we will be able to create MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is arranged, because we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb must be retrieved. the process of this section is described in this section, must be repeated for any type & CD; it is repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are a & CD, which is not included in freedb, the screen photos will not see a bit differently than the data for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; data can be manually entered, instead of it from the internet. comments will refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD must now be defined in the drive on the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD can be identified and identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, then look for questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successful from the freedb could already be completed, all titles of the pieces are already filled and also displayed by the artist's name and album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; keys for your & CD; available, a window will be integrated, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion fits best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for Settings), you can also manually redeem this manually by selecting the first button in toolbar. if you don't have local database, but the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD-data and the titels of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; accordingly to the samples on the next screen, the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'actuator title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Update title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidisparell per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all the songs of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful departure from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it's always a good idea to check the contents of the CD Editors (e.g. if all words with big letters begin or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you have ID3v2 tags; this option is set up on the tab tab, throw it a look into the section 'Basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codeers or file formats. see the coaster's help to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select a record, which is obvious with the style of the chosen CD; this is not important because we don't miss the & CD; data is not important. for more information you go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available at Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' come back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors appears again and you will see that the fields for the album has already been filled with the entered data we just give the entries for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the piece in any case and other information which you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure for the same way up to all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the product list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles will be selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the unit, or enter the button all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">"" "" "" "was launched by clicking on the button selection, this window appears to confirm. click OK, and then we will take a look at the window with orders and track what is going on." ""</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders orders to switch on the order window. it is available in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program will be displayed at the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You can see this error message if you are trying to work with a coincidence that you have not installed. pieces which have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example. did you checked if you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Order 1 reads the first piece of it, it is finished. but we have a new entry: job 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 to format MP3. thus, check out and encode in parallel. please note the status of the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the Programmes has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior is the result of parallel networks is the result unclear. the machine used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneously read and encode (however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order in the maintenance length of the Kodierer stands. after the last piece is encoded, a small window is integrated with a message for a short time at the upper left of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you will need & kde; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you will need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1631">Song lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use textures, others use liedtance and again other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, so you will automatically adjust the karaoke text. you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to adjust a event type, select the settings of text files or songings. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which can be summarised. these are the series to be played in this section, as you can use the collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To draw a collection, open the collection manager at first. here you will find the collection of collection under the point.... click here to New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can adjust the desired manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be stored. consider it if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, they must add a song for collecting managers. once again, you can add a song. once again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends from the setting Automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (using file opening or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatic is not activated for the collection, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and reert. this collection will then be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song, and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series after playing the menu button, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove any order in the menu, the order will be established.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select the collection manager, or use the selection list on karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu pieces or press the right arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump a song, select the button foremost, the entry predictable piece from the menu pieces or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection, and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be deleted. however, this doesn't matter if they are saved during the leaving of & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map General-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create an MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of Type Change patch to Trumpet and is always a trumpet, when it was originally a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one soundcard, you don't need a MIDI map because all soundcards are compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS maps, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">An MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required conditions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. for this, however, a different text ID has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END of the KEYMAP "name of the Keymap..." END (KEYMAP "One more Keymap... END) CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that it is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so I can support in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not General MIDI files.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches is stated as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal mark is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are currently in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all-keysTo M is used to place all sounds which this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (e.g. with sound 60), you can have a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (defensive elements) it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here, with the term drum patch the patch is meant that every tone is a different percussion instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;), and not that, in which the sound is the pitch of the same drum (as many keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify such as sounds on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section the sequence of lines is very important, as their availability. they must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple cones for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use several names only in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyaps are mainly used to form tones on the percussion channel. check out the supplied cone.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to make some channels simultaneously. if you want to replace the first and the second channel, make it quite simple in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is illustrated on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap needs to be defined in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case there will always be patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied by the value n, this is used with the value n * (r / 4096) and then it will be redirected. the value of 4096 is used, so that the Map-file does not appear in the Map-file (decimalmas).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM indicates that a keyboard player is to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards up to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards to find two sounds up to one octave higher. to get the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try out.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In order to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. you will find the settings below settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. if you have changed an instrument, if you have changed an instrument, the button does not illuminate more green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. the view of the menu settings below the dot-channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD displays the speed which is played with a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find such a song may be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">An MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. thus it can lead the same MIDI file to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can nidirectional, & kmid; however, a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs a similar sound quality. in addition to a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from cold; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Understood, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. open the folder you want to add into & conqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">"" "activate" "" "activate" "" "activate" "" "activate" "" "to activate the collection of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to temporary collection." ""</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can set the arrow button on the left from Tempo- LCD to slow down the reproduction. to restore the default tempo you can click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & conqueror; windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; in this mode, I have to play a karaoke file (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, merely go into the & conqueror; -window to change the file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file, without order to add to a collection, turn the setup Automatic adding to the collection, and the new file will be added to temporary collection added of files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. not only want to play the first file. so, set the setting automatic add to collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you entail to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards! all many thanks! if I listen to this songs or the postcard, animated me, continues to program & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to pick up the preferred connections under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the thumb playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups in order to add an extra hierarchestufe. if you copied an entry, his group and all its subgroups to the current category. and playback begins with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and thumb playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML files. of course, the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps can also be changed, but also by application itself. simply select the XML content of this divider only.</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo, it should also work (probably this sort of playback of video devices under Linux can also work on the first screen (: 0.0). this reason, the video forlinux has to be functional for the X server, therefore it must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1803">When creating the own template it is necessary to know what character strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this character string will be replaced by the input in the documentary class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$].</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and that associated entry into the editor. once the document was created, the following steps were completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the template can then be balanced instead of the standard.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantitative, have a little bit too. thus, the plugin system is very powerful. you can now benefit from the additional functionality and do not need to wait until somebody can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements can be found in a large number of & GUI; more about it below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or part, we start plugging plugins with the menu plugins. the following dialog is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all the plugins and add any new plugins. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search ad. when adding plug-ins without a storage location & quantitative, this path leads to the plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project several persons in a sort of hierarchical relationship. & quantitative data; supports the indication of Team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the top name of the user and serves for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as both team manager and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can search for himself from the list of team members who is it. this happens when he is looking for the team member from the list and expresses the button Setze. the currently selected member (its identification) will be fett after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Top names and attitude of their own identity are important for messages and notes. see for more information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage through the capture of members of the team: it can be created an event for information to the team leader when something specific. see in further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event promotions are actions which will be executed if something specific could be done in the project. one example would be viewed later, or the sending of a message if a file is secured, or a script that will play a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the side event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog can create events, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An EMail is sent to the address data of the selected address data. the address at the address can be a team or sub-project leader. see in, wei such ladder are set.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note: it is easy to enter. it can be selected either of the editor menu entry menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary range followed by announcing text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax of the team member states or @ annotation (role), whereby the top name of the team leader subproject leader Subproject leader Subproject manager should be given the appropriate range or subproject leaders, as in the examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Top names and roles names are independent of large or small scrap, but spaces for the brackets and the note: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and & CSS. day folders contain two file types, the tag folders and the toolbars. tag folders are handy, symbolic-oriented lending of image buttons (above the editing window), text and instructions faster into a document as a user may vary.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be envious (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details for the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. shortly, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featualoges, the & quantitative data; for the day shows the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. toolbars provide fast insert of tags in a document without risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag files are nothing as a folder. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the writable language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and clarified whether they are necessary, or not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better insight and more information on the work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits are explained in a simpler way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">That is the root element of a TagXML document. it can occur only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but also contains no one element type over themselves else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface name and a methodology name. the arguments that can be handed over to the method. can be empty or% daily name%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that is grouped together with the elements of a list. it can only occur at once. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of a tags within a dialog. this day can only occur in a dialog for every attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with an & XML; Declaration begin: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neat and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog is above & quantitative; -Window to start and check TagXMLA. another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, verification only occurs during charging the tagXML files in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; scheme. the file name for this TagXML file should be recorded.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just quite simple and there is a editor that can be edited via DTD edit DTD settings. thus, diedesetrc; for one of a list selectable & DTEP; it should be created for a newly created & DTEP; it should create a simple & descriptionrc; it should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] Version = use 1 for & quantitative; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can be set with settings... click on New action to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">That this promotion is allocated to the keyword. with clicking on the user, a button closure can be assigned; with Kone is the current keychains.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simpest promotions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and inserted in the document of the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications can be started (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or modify (or parts of the document), but are the quick start-start dialog or the various See in... promotions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">The first must be the name of the script and interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are permitted, it is recommended to use the% scriptly variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / apps in their path: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document names.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; process. if by & quantitative, only one instance is running, the text is used to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantitative; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, normally the file name of the document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods you can accept a script from & quantitative; on the default input. in the selection box may be determined, what to send to the default entry. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">The selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the introduced application can also be guided. there are two types of output: normal issue, on the default output issue; error messages can be noted, which shall be specified to the default output written by the value the selection box output is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market-up language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the case there are not too many, so it can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add actions and configure actions. choose Settings promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the lower end of the window will start working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day attributes has and you are planning to edit the dialog "Day" when available, allowing an input when use the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will be & kiconedit; use the & kbox; graphics further programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used as standard 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually used as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to be signalized; starting this item is a & lt; starting; -day in current document is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this happens about the menu with Settings... (in & quantitative;) and selection of the desired action. besides the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so there's still what is or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantitative; -functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups. open the toolbars dialog for selecting the toolbar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the Trenner (very left above) for my tool bar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I want to preview for example a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note that the separators support the group. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & conqueror; -button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by trial of all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after re-XML does not exist, it will be stored in the correct folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your tool bar (n) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the elect enlargement of & quantitative enhancement; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language that you like to love. this chapter describes how I use a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check out in & quantitative; -Repository if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to search a existing documentation for the formation- / script / etc; language. then you will have to create the docrc file. we will then cover the second part we will handle the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc] = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for this documentations e.g. & PHP; section 2, tag1, tag2, tag2, tag2, tag2, tagn3 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc tell you = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 for scanning, # Getting Started = introduction,... Continution.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic Reference = Conage.basic syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a subfolder in tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess pash (except in Reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents can be referenced directly onto a file (and consequently at the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; ressources can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The synth section is the area of the docrc file, which is intended to be displayed on the design of the convex _ Fetch _ array function. by marking the function called and pressing Ctrl; H for context-help would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file connections.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of simple context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file dorc / doc or $KDEDIR / persa / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / directory / apps for local or global use. then create a folder (as you stated that in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation here.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that these well and it is worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the use of the & quantitative; -community. they will not be rich but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative data; you are not alone. it is possible to share the vert resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or else. at different places, there is an email address, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tooling toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all other & quantitative data; -users can be reviewed and only made available if our team uses them as a correct and useful for the publication, to what it guarantees a GPG / PGP key. this means that the source of resources is ensured, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several key, you can get a look. in the dialog box the input fields must be filled empty (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking OK the upload process.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), tool bar tool bar, and in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installing & quantitative, the integrity of the resource has been warned by the integrity and the Signification. if the integrity has been given, and it may be canceled. if the integrity and the resource comes with signature, a message appears with the specifying the owner of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantitative software, but it can be time to work, because hundreds of day files might be necessary in the tagXML format, there is easier way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the Menu DTD Download and converting your DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that will be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: newly created & DTEP; will be written by this name to the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitive line: the character string that appear in! DOCTYPE day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / Appmld</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, scores & quantitative; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative information; there are some key concepts. to understand this and full use of & quantitative; they must first be able to deliver this fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantitative; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projections. this differentiation affects a number of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are used for each, the & quantitative control; uses, available. of toolbars over actions, everything is marked globally, in common file structure of & quantitative. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which at each time is available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development devices for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Projections are available only within a specific project. this can be all supported by & CSS; designs up to tool bar with special actions especially designed for the files of a specific project. all elements are stored in the folder Tree of the project, which are the common use of special tools and designs of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editors, the building setting, the boxes with infos and the toolbars. please add in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document matching entries, like close the current, other or all boxes, recharge, erase or upload the document, jump to an expeditions or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Legal click on the editorial department lead to another context menu related to the revised documentation, such as fundamental processing steps (cut / copy / added), editing the mouse under the mouse pointer or opening the file, if the string bet under the mouse pointer a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors there are the tools of the Editors. currently, & quantitative; 4.01 Transitional as default, for which a set of tool bar will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantitative; the tool bar will be adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if they want to insert it, then click the icon that the day represents, then you can enter the data for this just entered day. if you want to insert the data for this just (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog for different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) allow to navigate to the information about & quantitative; to navigate them and to pass through. in the presentation with carteireiters are available for files, project, sample templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation buildings.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that allows you to manage all files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project by right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, upload or deletion of files from storage media can be performed using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantitative; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depends on & quantitative. global templates are always available, local templates for the corresponding user and templates in projects are available only in the project. more to templates can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of the integration in Global, Lokal and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information on a script. via the right mouse button there are further functions available, such as the script will be able to edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view it shows the internal structure of the active document. by Left-Click an element, the cursor is set on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and review of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it can change many attributes and name rooms, which enables the change of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download and edit your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitative owns; two boxes of boxes at the lower end of the window that can be reached via the usable information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartridge shows information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the document used DTD uses the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This Carteireiter shows all the bug in the markup of the current document. & quantitative data; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (such as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative and toolbars; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the option of the tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantitative. is the ability to send a toolbar with an email. & quantitative call, sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar Archive via & kmail; if they receive a tool bar in an email, you can get them in & quantitative; like any other secure and charge!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantitative; -files on your system. it has to be handed over a number of options to be handed over to the Script script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at the start of & quantitative; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before her bin folders. same applies to & Qt;</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative aplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative web development is optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a wide variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; developer, the developer of & quantitative, began to deal with a close idea: what would be when & quantitative market editor would have? well, this would be the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done so.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on clean & HTML; limited, is & quantitative; now it's far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. now it is possible to define it in & XML; then it should be & quantitative; it should be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantitative research; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; report is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; rumours is not only it all possible, but allows users and developers to expand, as it need for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitative interface; allows you to improve the use of a intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (on MDI;). this can increase productivity with intuitive actions, scripts and toolbars. thanks to the programme, you can also find & quantitative tax. (more then you will find them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is connected in no way with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More into the details about the detailed documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & conqueror; enter or save the help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently developing and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files which you have opened. this list changed every time if you open a file, which is not located on the oldest entry.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later usage. check in the section above templates. should they try to save the selected file / Text out of the local / project template folder, only an error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted to insert from the clipboard there are special characters to & HTML; note that it can be detected correctly and not understood from browser as a formatting order.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converted the text from the clipboard in & URL; note that the correct way to insertion of special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s into the anchor-day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to resp. it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the Shift. button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">For a character string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type of grep or SED with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the message window at or not. that's the window where you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Expansion and Switching of the problem reporters at the lower edge of the & quantitative; main actors. the problem reporter is activated as soon as to the structural tree changes.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbols of the main window on the main window. this column allows you to set the bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will be appearing in the menu together with the entries, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other documents appear in the menu grouped according to the file names of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantitative data; projects are stored by File Extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">A dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables, for example graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and add to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Download the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have additional inputs / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantitative; the project manages the project. chapter & quantitative issues; projects are explained details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project tool bar. these are kept in project position / toolbars and are only assigned in this menu if you have assigned them this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. that creates only the name. actions must be stored by settings... are added to the tool bar or you will be asked if you want to store the machine tools.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the viewing range. if you are not saved from the hard disk. if you don't have any tool bar, you will be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send your own tool bar at someone (maybe at the & quantitative call; team, so the tool bar will be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of tool bar to the main server, where each other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that you or any one has made and convert into the & quantitative format; own label-format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Download / refresh to realities from the & DTD; to renew itself, without the whole & DTEP; to renew this globally, and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, fails the load.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that is loaded into the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows you to access the current day setting dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the menu Tags, followed by & DTD; -specific undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivated the intelligent insert of tags. currently this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. smart insert means that & quantitative means that inserting tool bar does not work on this place the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plugins listed below are listed below. click on. click on a activated plug-plugins.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Elects the syntaxes set-up mode for the current file. the list of available dimensions schemes depends on derate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-up-identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to create developers. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Examines the syntax of the current document based on selected & DTD; by means of external use Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the changeover time may need time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the cartridge mode, which is also the default setting mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantitative; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu for each open window will have a entry. with selection of a contract, the corresponding window will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Turns the display of the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantitative; main chamber on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog does not influence any application that use the KHTML Part, including the & conqueror; web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">The behavior of the editors is one. in the documentation of & Kate. finds details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbars or modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the mouse button, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative software; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but like with each open source project, developers can always use help. if they want the & quantitative form, you will find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self explanatory and should be completed by the top of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project, and all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 Project Properties Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative file; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without space with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine that you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.f. .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you use this field empty, default settings of the selected protocol is used. depending on the remote controller, a adaptation might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">That is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be discontinued instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bar will be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local file system into the project. several files or whole file can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great when you have static web content you can download and change. with serverside scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;), you must go different.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Pact if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are to be mounted. if a project is based on new, not anaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders can be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in main folders. you can select the desired files through anhooks, or remove the checkbox out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded into the menu with Project Properties in the menu mode or using the Shift Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some attitudes correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described below. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholder possible) which can be re-read in projections such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option to top, also listed files that are listed in .cvsignal are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded at the opening of the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This means that your debugger can be selected. currently, Gubed will be supported. more information on Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the options. in this mode the error is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the bottom window profiles can be uploaded (see in) as well as the display of a building view for the contents of the server for each profile by clicking an own building view for every profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, one can change event promotions, change or delete these promotions, change or delete. event actions are executed if a previously certain event enters, such as the fuses of a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantitative opens; the last project, which was opened. this behavior is not possible to influence this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog box is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantitative data is closed, the project file will be automatically stored. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantitative files. same happens if you want a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project management gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">File behavior likewise, but missing the items open and open with... in the right mouse button of the open context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. profile contains information about the place of high-read files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will end to prevent removing the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the nuclear storage and forget it. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsecure password on the plate does not enter the option.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before loading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative interface; many high load profiles can be created and so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. when working or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that should be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this must not be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attacking hole, this is either a timesaving function or a danger. use it to your discretion. the password will be stored on the plate, so that it can't be read easily, but each with programming languages can easily see in the text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can be used in a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view, you can replace various files and toolbars and replace the current files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or the project toolbar, can be stored or deleted via Settings tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative; in which one has most to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantitative; the best of the menu tool bar can be stacked. using and adding tool bar will be treated below in the section adding machine tools.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set on the toolbar menu (right click on the toolbar), in which the new toolbar can be set, there can be other actions like toolbar, tool bar rename or tool bar can be executed in the dialog where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (icon) on a toolbar, additionally the entries are removed and action worked, the self-explanatory are explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions can be set in the menu with settings toolbars... and settings are set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential document badge, code-Schnitzel and files on linking. & quantitative data. you can copy, move or any in the system existing directory into the template's template. templates have in & quantitative; in about the restrictions you need to set up for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative data; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of any template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary's all, which is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in documents via shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the template-tree under global templates. further information about templates tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text file type. on the basis of this templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple report for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate way to be efficiently. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents. you can find all of a comment about a final volume up to a complete volume on JavaScript or Perl-based. see in for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says we serve these templates for all websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents, which can be organized in a file structure. currently there are no examples in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure to exposures (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File as template as a local template to store....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that happened, note that (even if it is stored as a project template), the template is not visible in the project tree. check in the area tree under project buildings.</seg>
<seg id="2205">In your document, select text in your document and click file as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and lay on the construction view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only used in a template folder. it can be used to use all file management functions such as pulling and retrieval or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can choose from a file tree or in the project files Baumanview to a folder on the right and secure site template. by default, it is secured by default, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very targeted pre-oriented approach or dynamically with & PHP; create files, add files or merge with them. in addition, some things can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep-green.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The structure structure in the subwindows templates is based on the files generated in $KDEDIR / share / apps / directories / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / directories / Quanta / templates / directories. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as shown above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set up the behaviour of a folder where you can select the mouse button with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu tab. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blown down once elternal attributes can be inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template. if a regular folder would be set, unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a pediatfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you by prior or shown text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or foot lines for all templates for a particular project and enables copying of ingredients in a folder with special headlines / foot lines a whole presentation with matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a command menu (on request, right mouse button) on a full command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">It offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source text editor, which are accessible via the menu. the first mode replaces the source editor in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: he invites you to edit a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch to the source code stored in the VPL; editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that includes & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. there is no plans to change this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that simultaneously running the changes in the source editor and in the VPL; editor are synchron in the source code and in the VPL; editor is already active, the key pressure on the active cursor is activated from a window to the others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source text editor can be selected via settings of VPL; you can choose between synchronization according to one click or automatically. if the selection can be set automatically, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the titles of the website, so it is possible to select the processing of invisible tags in working with the VPL; editor is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. that's the reduction of the hanging body. this means that you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags permit the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. punch words for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click into the list allows the amendment to the inhaltes, e.g. key words on the column names and keyword keywords.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of shaping of pages in browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below list or delete. a change on the list is exactly as for the meta elements. the work of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to mount an external CSS style connection by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of curscursors is as in a text processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is stalled. the marking works as usual. lyrics can be inserted by single tap and can be deleted by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way through the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it's to be aware that the insertion of tags will not be removed (e.g. if an anchor-day, surround with text, each other ambient temperature must be removed).</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bar like the tables assistant or the Listen-Assistant are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; work in this release must be used in the tables or lists of tools.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for analysis of styles. in contrast to other programs for styles the search for certain elements are possible and the design of styles can be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; you have successfully compiled but you need libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already present at a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Stop in a template on a place in one of xsldbg charged style or xml file or at current node. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: set in gdb compatibility mode, can be set immediately in a specified file and line number and later activated.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg determines the full path from a filename without punctuation. filenames in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relativly path to the working folder icon xsldbg is an example of a Stilpreheated file.. / en / xsldoc.x.xb, the following input is possible:</seg>
<seg id="2231">In this command, a partial or entire agreement with a preage called QNAP ME or a specified modusname is checked. & eg; template is agreed with each myQNAME, which contains the string template.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for the same. why thus & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the posts made many changes and at the same time the influence had corrected. another programmers had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts to conduct.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within this lines. and there was no information on the places where perhaps the influence had changed. this changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any amount of more useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare fast text, copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the same and merge of folders. this function was related & kdiff3; almost in a fully-tested file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of cooperate and changes the original file (the basis) helps to process the dissolving result. this Editor allows you to edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result. the screenshot shows three Quell files during cloning:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also complete the same and merge file. this screen photograph shows & kdiff3; when file merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and are based on the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you need to check these functions, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see at a glance in the column on the left side. (no trouble more if Jone change the influence.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, then the color indicates that file is different. red color indicates that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make the Tipparwork easier by writing only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 2 kdiff3 folder Folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder, folder 2 folder 3 folder, folder 2 folder 3 folder.</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual setting of file names, the selection above the file format (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the list. you must not specify a third file; if you let the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Above the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge file is selected, if for A file is selected, then uses & kdiff3; the file names from A in both other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If interlocking is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file. you can also get this step later while saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you would not like to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard in the active comparison window. compared to Open Dialog, you have to select no files, you can simply connect the dialog with the off button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use gypsum and drag: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and leave it over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similarly these features are, it would be just like to load and compare these relevant sections. now you can copy and compare these relevant sections, then compare and then compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can remove anything from & kdiff3; remove only the rest of the text in a comparative window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interprets the pulling and retrieve text into another program as cut and insert (instead of copying and insertion). in such cases your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box, the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that windows C is optional.) Any Info line has a different color. (if the path comes to a file, leave the mouse over the line. then a small accessory window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a color is blue, B, the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees the color, which file differs. if both files are different, the default color is for red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is visible in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In addition to the text, the column is displayed. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. with some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful only to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in character strings and comments, for the processor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the interdial column from the text, where the respective source file has no lines. if the line-turn is activated, the line will be displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (under the comparative figures) also has an information line with the inscription:, the filenames and [encoder], if you have processed the result. normally it contains the automatic movement, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! till all conflicts have been dissolved, the saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to the next most dissolved / ungodly conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is to be solved in the same time a conflict of the manual.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By one click with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed, where the current group is not visible.) This group is then highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left shows a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic merge or manual loading, no further line remains in the group; then it is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your opinion, and perhaps again a different source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, still in a marking which you may copy and add differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; interaction confluence; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources select the options to ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly to the image processing and mouse, but you can also use the arrow keys left, right, high, round, side down, side down, Ctrl-beginning and Strg-end, Siw can also be used by other programs. the supersafest column next to the vertical picture strip can also be used by clicking on navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with insertion button you can switch between feet and transfer mode. (default is the entry-in mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary-columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as described in the section) and the editable output window was explained.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Fig. / Strg-Fig.) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Image Rewards / Strg-Image Abroad) or to the next / previous conflict continues to be considered a conflict. therefore, between dissolved and invalid conflicts must also be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrg-insert). if this option is activated, the option will be automatically copied to the clipboard and automatically adjust manual copying. be careful with this option, because you might want to see the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenches are stored accordingly to the respective operating system. UNIX variants use a row-line sign\, and Win32-based systems using the line-line\\ r\. Kdiff3 maintains the line of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restored in the next start. (menu setting) &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog displays scriptures with variable width to choose, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you disable this option, the differences are displayed in short text. if the chosen scripture does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be represented. on these systems the button presets automatically introduces an odastated color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, when pressing the tab key, the corresponding number is inserted. otherwise it is inserted a tab character.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the setting of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, any selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard. manual copying into the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-type type you prefer to Save. the default value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the same files try & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines are to be ignored. only during this first step, white characters are ignored. the second step is not ignored every line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. too, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car back mark '\' at the end of a line, other in turn, only one lap plate, but then they could only be handled with different sizes in the side-side comparison, though they are different. if this option has to be activated, however, this option must be disabled. in default, this option has to be disabled. this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. however, the differences are still indicated, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively, even smaller differences are looking for. this option is activated in default and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic check mode, this setting, how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next release is continuing.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves the conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters occur in many files. if you don't need to use the functions of voters in numbers or comments, if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in chapter for scanning of folders and transmitting a merging. look for details on documentation to the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .original file, if already a backup file with the suffix .original exists, this will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to finish and restart the current program. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is terminated globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for the encoding appears a short notice that is the local coding. (this can't be changed here and has a clean character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this does not affect how special characters is treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you want to process a file, you can define which coding are used to store.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define precepts, they could not work with your codec. (e.g., your files may not be Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output of Vorverprocessing.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this to suppress the readings of changes in white characters in the text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are displayed in a colorfully coded transformer column. but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal version with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. blending the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Classified the comparison window next to each other or to each other. this can also be useful to ads of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files. here, if you are using only two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file names of the last source file as pre-set name for the output file. (if this function is used to start merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own label, e.g. for cutting undisturbing parts or to correct use.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this remote command (see above), then the output of the command is used only when using this command processor command. you can write your own label, which corresponds to your requirements. each input line needs to have a corresponding issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is possible to enable the user more flexibility when creating the Diff results. however, an external program needs, and most users want to program it. the good news is, however, that in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command to convert the input into large letters: SED's /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergent expression on any character string. the\\ 1 in the replacement text does not refer to the found text in the first clung. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated character strings (info: / cvs / keyword\\\ _ BAR _ copy\\\\\ $\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with SED, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may use this regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignored numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it's good as an example for a further processing command for line abbreviation. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'is a suitable matches, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, thus virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the requirements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED you can also use something different like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allerdings are needed for perl some details. where SED\\ (and\\) needs to be perl only (and) without the '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data following the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and merge. the other operations change only the data that the line output equal to Algorythmus sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Please note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-processor does not see the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful but how the text changes or differences are hidden, you can't notice certain differences and do in the worst case important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to process many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folders and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can customize the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate and show the simulated changes, without creating them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... executes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6-key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and merge of individual files. you just need to file the file on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are summarized, folder 1 is used as a basis. if no target file has been given, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will not start automatically the merge. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you will inform you a small message window over the current progress. if you start scanning the folders, only the files are listed, which have been compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folders that was found during the Scan can be found here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">File size is usually folded. you can select a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or select the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu includes two functions and all subdirectories with which you can open all folders or fold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a double click, the file is started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different from the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such cases the merge-feet action can not be selected automatically. if the merge may be started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if its total content is identical. then, file the same color. with folders, the age is insignificant for his color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colors reflect the colours of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copy of A (or if a does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicitly specified target file, then chooses & kdiff3; the required action is identical, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: merge and the result in both folders. (the user can see as visible file names for the output file just B; directly after merging and kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders can be merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe), then examines & kdiff3; the date of files and suggests the newer file. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such bugs cannot be solved, the merge of the file can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is done according to the other. you will show the status column if the merge has been successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected. if the merging is complete, you should make a final review and see if the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If set in a setup dialog for full analysis, Kdiff3 will display additional columns. these include the number of ungasteries, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts will only be displayed if three folders are compared to or merge.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge either the selected entry (file or odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the clutations-related actions (also in all subjects), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target file, then in the three-file merge mode C is used as the objective, where two-file merge will lead B as a goal and to synchronize A and / or B as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries could be displayed in the folders, also in the file structure, there are some options due to the certain entries could be displayed. check these options for unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To summarize all entries: select directory guide / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keychains). to run only the current entry: select promotion of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If using contradictory file types still uninvalid merge promotions, a message appears that shows the incorrect elements. they can then choose a valid promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you carry out all entries, a dialog window appears with options, ejaculating and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Dial Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then receive a complete list of all promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; runs certain actions with all entries. if a manual input is necessary (merge of a single file), then a merge window will be open (note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready to start with a file, choose a directory guide / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages which can help you to select the cause of the problem or to solve the problem to select or to solve the problem in any way before using the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If there are some entries individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not lead them together with later. even if this merge has been carried out or not saved, these entries will be taken as done. only if you change the merge promotion, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called Directory Conduct with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit onto the specified sample are displayed in the Elemental tree. do you separate the samples with a semicolone; valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files which are also ignored by CVS. many autmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted specifically with a .cvsignal file. (check out at info: / cvs / cvsignal).</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a hiding -attribute. in other file systems marks a leading point. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is shut down, symbolic link is compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to show the links. this is deactivated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to folders: if the option is switched off, the links is switched on. if the option is enabled, the links are treated as normal folder and recursively searched it. (note that if the option is turned on a link to itself, lead & kdiff3; crashes off.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns. (the number dissolved, unquestioned, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis, and considerably slower when it is applied to files that do no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folder on a slow network, it may be much faster, only the change date and the file size is to compare. this speed is required by default. please use this option for default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly to the change date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered identical if it is equally large, if it is equal to copying the change date. please use this option for default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating synchronize mode if two folders are compared and no target file specified. in this mode, the proposals will be identical to merge that both folders are identical. this option is switched off in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered insecure, because it is no knowledge that the other file does not have changed.) This option is shut down in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by another file, the original version is renamed and obtains the extension .original. if an old backup file with the .original extension already exists, this is also possible without further backup. this option is enabled in the default setting. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the file merge updates are visible in the merge of single files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want that, you can switch the window toolbar into the window menu and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file just using double click. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also use a single file, without first file merge. once you can save the result, the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged again when you start folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO-slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax for local files and folders. some things should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undoder. or.. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty card &gt;% 20, etc.), for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder. then, a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to process permissions or change of change. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original. (note that this option is only possible in local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently available as the differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts at first always the built-in differences test. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as KPart, it takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from patch file. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the cqueror, you can preview on a patch file and choose a patch menu click - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if not the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since generation of Patch-file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the same of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot) is already available. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 shows that it can perform as the diff3 program from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot when I saw in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone this way or want to go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You don't have the program compiled from sources and it doesn't have the right prefix to KDE. in default, KDE can't find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you can find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines will be treated as the same; if only one non-white characters is treated differently, the line will not be treated as the same. if there is no other than the other, this box is codec. this box is guaranteed the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice for each difference in the files where it starts and where he ends. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a file format which could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort to have so far too big. you can always recover a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit bigger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src left; published and the text does not delete. what does it mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors for lifting differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. use the other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you will need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; to compile and install, use the following command in the basic folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-You gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are uncertain, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should have no problems at compile. should however, trouble occur, please report on the & kde; maillists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or switch-removing) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences in: files that are identical in all folders, do not appear in the folder, therefore not in target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you have to re-read the folder with the function Update to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are displayed. if the target folder cannot be copied to merge folders. if the target file does not contain these files, they are missing after the merger. (the behavior is probably modified in a later program version.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are attached to one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group (if they are not already present), if the lines are already present, they are immediately removed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting this option is disabled. differences in single signs (e.g. 'A' and 'a') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The &-pager; shows a minipreview of all virtual work surfaces. it is quite practical to change their size to move them or move them or move them. this works both within a single Desktop as well as at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can view all virtual work surfaces as well as those in running applications. applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and the other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible within a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on it, where the right mouse button is clipped. if it was clicked on the empty background of & kpager; however, the context menu has only be clicked on an application within & kpager; however, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and end. these commands include the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows within the & pager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, will be displayed in & kpager; the names of virtual work surfaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross the field lets you cross the & kpager; the numbers of virtual working areas. is it together with name, the names are provided with ordained, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also appear as background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in & kpager; indicated. otherwise only the empty space surfaces are displayed in order to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window selected. just shows simple rectangle with the proportions of program windows. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of & kpager can be determined: classic can be known & kpager; in some other window managers, like from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally shows all virtual working areas in a vertical row, which is very good for the display at the front of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The &-pager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniprogram in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can display windows as symbols or with their contents. it also runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & cager; and followed by selecting the switch-switch... lets the dialog be released.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this can not be changed in the dialog for Settings: but you can finish this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc using any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you must register to your system administrator. in this file you need to transfer the key windowtransparent mode and to this value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded by new features. it is optimized for use on performance computing.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you play & kmag, a window as shown above. shows the extended range of screen. in the following, this window is named as magnifying window.. The picture that is displayed in the magnification window is an enlarged range of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, it has increased & kmag. alternatively, you can see & kmag. alternatively a selected screen range in the magnification window (select mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer on the screen (eg; on the left screen).</seg>

<seg id="2487">If you add the & Shift; button or use the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection point is fixed and just the lower right corner is to move.</seg>

<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool is started; at every start of & kde; available. this function is currently under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments please check the respective documentation to figure out how you start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all the settings on the values which were stopped when opening the dialog. if you already pressed the button, the settings are reset to the users after pressing the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially with the presets. in particular, intelligent move, you should first be switched off. if you are accustomed to the automatic mouse, you can later remove the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect. clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in browser window that doesn't link to unwashed reactions. you can use the mouse to park such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is rucking, you should clean your mouse. that's normally quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse balls, but also the roles in contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to remove the mouse balls. as it happens, from mouse to mouse differently, it should be quickly clear when you see the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can easily scrape off with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks the version of & kmousetool; when you just start a shifting process. if you're in this case the intelligent move, means that & kmousetool does not mean by leaving the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this will be reset to the status of & kmousetool; and you can also work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to perform mouse click and sets the cursor to another passage.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of mind when you want to make it possible. however, you can use the mouse for mouse pointer. secure zones for mouse pointer are & eg; the grey surfaces around the tool bar and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with an intelligent move, but I do not create it to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Intelligent move is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it's very probably possible to move it into the clipboard or move it with pressed mouse button. however, there will probably be some problems once again. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Just don't use the smart move, if you just start with & kmousetool; please note the text instead of a mouse click and hold the switch-off key, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and enter the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Using the audible mouse click. thus, if & kmousetool, the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click. so you can easily use the intelligent move without the audible mouse click. but this need some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; must be installed, the XTest extension for & X Window, must be installed. this should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are decorated correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; check out the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer. this program was developed for people who suffers to the RSI syndrome, and to whom the Confirm dies pains pains.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured that there is a certain time it is waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button will start. in this way, the pulling power can also be carried out using the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card map you can set special actions which are always executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processed four types of language orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The edition of Screen-Readern has advanced the highest priority. it will be submitted to all other orders and holds these orders. after the output of the Screen readers will be read, the requested orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved for hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the presentation of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just have a long text on a web page, you can welcome you with & kmouth; nevertheless somebody welcome the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or issue of a screen-reader, add & ktts; the audio output into the maintenance-long one.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be interrupted when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound is active as well as introductory message, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card map are only valid for normal text applications. for messages, warnings and issues of screen reagents there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a voice recording. this standard contains stamps for controlling voices, voice of voice and pitch. furthermore, marks for the control of the pronunciation. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & ktops; SSML only partially and only available in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (UK male) because it is the default voice that the festival is used in the issue of SSML.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and propositional recognition filter (SDB filter). this can start & ktops; faster with pre-reading, since only the first set is synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can also hold on the map of orders for a successive or return, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional recognition filter. during the first start of & ktops; it is automatically set up a set of satile filters. you can change its settings, or further propositional recognition filter, but is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the simplest, you can choose to set up the device selection by selecting. switch on the card selection and enter text. go on the card selection again, change some features and check out how the selection of the spokesman has changed, otherwise, you need more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then the first movement can start, since only the first movement has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can get text orders on the card map or cancel your function, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal Satisance filter is automatically set up when you start the tsmgr for the first time. it cannot change, only removed. change anything at this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a table character (decimal code 8), before filtering (decimal code 8), before the filtering is automatically removed from the text. note that the standard satpositional recognition filter keeps the character control.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied to & kde; messages (cold), warnings, messages or the edition of screen reagents.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from the normal Satisboundary filter, you can add this again by downloading the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card interface selected, you can write the subscribers for the application. the card card will be displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Using the standard speaker (the top on the card speaker). with other words, there are no intercom characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Using the appropriate speaker, which shows all characteristics of a furnished speaker. if you choose to delete or edit the spokesman; otherwise select & ktts; otherwise chooses & ktops; the spokesman that equates to the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speaking characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Choose the characteristics of the desired speaker. if this feature doesn't matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark the check box when you have the property priority before other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor during the release of the output, this will always be treated as a foremost important feature. if you want to specify this property, if you may know that a specific application text appears in another language as one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the field speaker, which is to clear to the following, click on the select button, and then use the speaker that corresponds to the nearest one.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 for the last text order in the maintenance-long. you can also specify a copy number. (without order number is input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately, when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Gstreamer is crashed and & ktops; it is probably completed. if the problem is not solved yet. at Gstreamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, it is possibly a compatible version of GStreamer. you can upgrade Gstreaming to update or uninstall.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA works not when I play with another application music. if I get a text order, frightened & ktops; a message appears on the & console; appears a message that says: re-open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-projected.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I loaded an extra voice for the festival from the internet. I installed it and can use them in Festival but kttsmgr will not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file, add $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsint / voivices. as a guide you can serve the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card audio, there is a setting speed. so this works, the program must be installed SOX and via the environmental variable PATH. some synthesizermoduls such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored when & ktops; & HTML; (it is indicated that the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; (see) or if you have very courageous, change the .xph file of the & HTML; and set up the microphone speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not create that web pages are read with a female voice. I have a female festival speaker, but & ktops; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta it seems to work the day Sable gender. so that festival does not produce an error, the XSL file for converting SSML into Saber the gender tags. the same applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a custom character set filter and now I can see in & ktts; not more satbilling or back. on the card recovering orders will be displayed, the order consists of existing only from a set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Intermonal sign (point, fracrate, exclamation mark, Komma and Semikolon) may not be able to filter. use a filter for propositional recognition.</seg>

<seg id="2811">In automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings will be collected by using a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server will control all the necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, therefore, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The TCP / IP address can be made to the TCP / IP address without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address you need to set the desired TCP / IP address. in the input field network mask is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialized the network interface during booting. if initialization doesn't wish, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the box box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address will not be used in the network. the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine whether the desired address is already used in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off according to your requirements. insertion of a network configuration is done by selecting from the list and click of interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs. switching on a activated network equipment will be disable by selecting the list and click interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The IP address of the host is fixed in the local subnet, which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support will be replaced by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers requires only IP addresses. if the calculator http: / / www.einedomain.org means that this name dissolves this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), it is enough when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool can be used with graphical surface as a package or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient for this case, but also the development program uses libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for experienced users. however, it's not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental networks technology will be discussed, in the second, all of & knetworkconf can be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace more information about IP networks. in this section, only basic information on the integration of PCs in a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4).</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge to address the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the networking administrator, which is available to a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can not be selected as any arbitrary!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When using a own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area for this purpose, to avoid IP address accounts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the internet, therefore its any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course you can access the Internet for such machines through setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually addresses are used in the area from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the mains mask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things reserved, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for the IP data line.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; are affected and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file will sometimes be dynamically modified in DSL connections, so it is then not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections, another content is specified as specified.</seg>

<seg id="2897">If everything has been smooth, the icon changes to the tape drive, in order to display that the band was mounted. in the Status bar, the volume of the tape can now be searched for the band through fold the entry into the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In front of the belt of the belt, initially the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>

<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up in the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the tape drive for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-revs version of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is tied to the drive. on some drives this is necessary to read read or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, tried & kdat; this setting is not working on tape drive. maybe this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, when soldering the integration of & kdat; automatically the band is out automatically. use this option not on floppy drive.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, trying to change & kdat; the hardware size of the tape recorder. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you'll need & kdat; in any case, block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band is formatted, write a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only be shown with a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(1 byte) The band ID. the format of this character string is machine name: seconds, whereby the name of the system is formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era has been formatted in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to use a file using the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar-archives that can be administer directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not an incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& kssystem log; is an & kde; viewing for system protocols. the program is available for inexperienced users, where you can get information about your system or where the system allows information about your system, or where the system enables fast access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystem log; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background. the program is suitable for experienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited on the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & kssystem log allows users to perform fast access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystem log; therefore trying to provide some extended functionality, which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol-files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 features and ksystem log; a series of useful functions. these include amongst others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocol files, for format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included, and will be explained in the following chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo shows & ksystem log; functions available, with their help, the individual protocol rows of a protocol file easily filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & kssystem log; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol has not been displayed, so you will not open a system interface. the protocol files will normally run under Linux in the directory / var / log, for normal users normally have no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip for filtering the filter strip, which is displayed automatically according to the selected filter setting. in the default setting, the selection box contains the selected filter. then, a protocol line will be displayed only if it is included in one of the columns the character string of the filter search engine.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry at this point. in the protocol file system, select the column process, and put it in addition in the filter strip the name of a process, then shows & ksystem log; all protocol lines have been submitted and compiled by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you recognize the important protocol lines. protocol rows of Level Error are displayed using a remarkable colour than protocol rows of the Level Note. the color display of protocol rows can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display specific process (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can be useful to examine the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the Samba server. in this case, use filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new-added protocol rows.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kssystem log; enables you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindow and manage. once you have selected a window, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystem log; has its own website on http: / / ksysteme log.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further current information about the supply of & kssystem log;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystem log; also in the following folder des & kde; -Subversion Archivs: ksystem log; in & de; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program up to the upstream of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to go on historical aspects here (among others because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone might try to make a machine to system V init, without a new installation and new format. therefore, you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there, if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also distinguishes itself by the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service which allows you to run the system or change to another round level. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services include not such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in any part under / etc / rc.d when you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is actually not much used for this. you can also run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d when you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default level is included in / etc / inittab. you should see in the initial range one line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre-set runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair any changes, then you will repair it by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start now all the correct scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that it's a argument that started and stop. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K includes, the script will be stop with the argument. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server-running level, that can be run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I also could have a user -running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be hard because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to trivial trivial: simply drag one entry from the range of availability services to one of the six rounds to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift the scripts between Runleveling or change the position within a level by moving it differently. thereby, the entry of its original runlevel (or its position) is removed. this happens if they draw an entry from the range of availability services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed if you want to copy them into a new runlevel, you need to select copy from the menu from Edit menu or select from the context menu -- even then, if the same entry previously existed in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry can sometimes be calculated. in such case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the ambient entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown in the paper basket. be careful.</seg>
