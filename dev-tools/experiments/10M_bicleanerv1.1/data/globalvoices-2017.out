although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is exceptionally large .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American films , I have read American music , American authors and sport .
in fact , this country had a serious effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
when he was 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible repor@@ ter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spi@@ racy of a oil @-@ Magn@@ ets , who wanted to occupy its interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was it as if it is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my ir@@ rig@@ ation had only been strengthened for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only land where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you can always be that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very bad love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the tourist group and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he goes with its Eng@@ ines .
he never holds his opinion behind the mountain as one says so nice .
he says exactly what he think , as a former colleague , it declared , and declared publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Latin@@ os , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him .
the 13 million votes which he won by the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ u@@ otto person , I asked me ?
I could not know Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people in harmony I had learned about my time in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , people from around the world , a deep stunning man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
in addition , Tr@@ um@@ ps also illustrates the fact that by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present publisher of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; agreed .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is also reflected in the contrast to the gener@@ osity that I fought with Sandy B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gles with Sandy B@@ ahr , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son .
it still fits them to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es that helped me with much patience and suffering from my colleagues , to get to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er council helped me much in my career .
these people and those caused by them deep@@ ened my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump pushed his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offer me a stop and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the conflict with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they have distributed either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , I broke out almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as r@@ assi@@ sts to record .
the people are classified , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
that is su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their congregations are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of which are the most white , for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to re@@ win the control of a country that she dis@@ ap@@ ed ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who commented on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ jection of the White Against all other Eth@@ nic &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; word from white to play on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what so much means Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the big Van Jones , exactly what was so great .
million people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you can always have , America is definitely welcome .
for this country chose as his President , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ er , whose history as he himself says , no@@ where else in the world would be possible .
however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the white America this promise and says : to hell with frequent , religious freedom and all the concept of Pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , they say .
at all that I think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with human rights .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the amount answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; have Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the amount .
&quot; have Latin@@ os a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were loud .
&quot; would anyone who do not so is like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an impressive and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan joined the words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was rejected .
the land , for which his Son was fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from the el@@ end to the stars : this Latin American children leave their love for music not through gar@@ bage

what did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ian city Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played on both places is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ col@@ oss@@ ical ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments an opportunity for over@@ coming poverty .
a musical school with 100 students have become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in Oaxaca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for its drugs mis@@ use and the ban@@ ker violence .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth so a rare hopes .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as Oaxaca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dust roads to go to their great passion .
they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ bul@@ let you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from gar@@ bage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is practically on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón , in the capital - on instruments which are made of recovered waste material :
music with recovered instruments made from local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling was started under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez in order to transform parts of the dimension in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , C@@ elli , double bass , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all out of the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ische and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez rec@@ alls a local econom@@ ist and musical teachers of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning of time :
first it was very difficult because we had no space for samples and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them are not together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something , which he had never seen before : one out of waste was produced .
today there is a complete orchestra that plays on instruments of recovered material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation of &quot; Land@@ mark Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ mark Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spect@@ acle from gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work successfully fight against illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal f@@ isheries fought .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that provides targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already been run in li@@ qu@@ ic waters of illegal fish before it was looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were brought in accordingly to this kind and inclined , a transg@@ ress@@ ors of this kind to its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ized rapidly against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing bed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Premier was surrounded by countries , which you simply ref@@ ug@@ ged everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members of Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the ken@@ ian fishing authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that discovered the ship in a stone time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was sold out of the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t able to catch him there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ aging of fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices and resources protects , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven out the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have eight countries to work together and work together , where it comes to illegal fishing industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tony Long , Head of P@@ ew Char@@ ging Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by the definition : what is being caught , is hidden because it is extremely difficult for it . the illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
due to the clear cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , of which certain living rooms and types are being protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems will harm the del@@ ic@@ ates balance .
but during the actions against the illegal fishing hur@@ ri@@ f@@ isheries , the actions were cur@@ ated by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , with the information between individual countries , so the actions are in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange for example lists existing licenses , news to susp@@ ects activities or details that you have noticed during a port spectrum or experienced .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships even very atten@@ tive when they move on the open lake , using satellite data .
this enables to mark the authorities to know ships , who discover in forbidden areas - about those who sum@@ mits that a ship invites its frozen fish to other ships .
in ide@@ als , such investigations show whether the ships have a fishing license where they were travelling , and possibly even if they have a criminal off@@ ences .
countries that are denied against illegal fishing . what means that the ships may not be sold in their ports . what means that the ships could not sell their charge . and that they could even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owner , meaning that the illegal fishing catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile no longer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to reach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen , penet@@ rate in Eastern African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish , which moves around the world in commercial fishing industry from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
among others , actions include as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licens@@ ing papers , indication of phant@@ as@@ ien@@ amen , fishing protected species and fish in conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also use the lack of international cooperation and the weak@@ nesses of a failed @-@ organised control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not say a ship illeg@@ ally fishing and a country then could say &apos; You shall not go on my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and just this leg@@ ale Schl@@ up@@ flo@@ ch tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships .
it was crimin@@ ating networks uncovered that the counter@@ f@@ eit lic@@ ences had been distributed in Tanzania . there were ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found burning ships and found .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us pretty far to the organiz@@ ational crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i , suspected ships with precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be further developed , helping out illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO who also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships over@@ turn their automatic identification systems , where they can no longer be used by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African nations actually influence influence on the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch &apos;s platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be rendered to the world &apos;s position every single tra@@ ce@@ able ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gathered together with the neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of it , and what does it - that &apos;s just sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and to bund@@ les their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ ge Tru@@ sts has to run a similar project , where a global system will resolve the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities does not only feel crime , but also sh@@ outs .
ships who had previously explo@@ ited without license and hardly with consequences , we know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in f@@ isheries sales , since then fishing boats are buying more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors took place on board towing network , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries do also notice that successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that us also have to copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa disappear annually several hundred million dollars through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six countries together , for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . however , they are now fight against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model like F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with safety , the goal , even more such initiatives and structures will also arise in other regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia could report his first big triumph in Somalia : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was used without license and were not only allowed to use Schle@@ pp@@ nets .
the ship also was reserved in banned waters who are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Take case against Gre@@ ko 1 found that it is a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collab@@ orative work is working in the entire World Sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela , demonstrations in several cities with the aim to conquer &quot; country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela , the application of Venezuela has rejected the request of opposition to a referendum on the political and economic crisis of the country , in whose eyes the negotiations carried out into the empty field in which they gathered together on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led to other parts of the country - among other things in the land area Bar@@ inas , in the Andes region Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , at the central north of the Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ dom@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country has deterior@@ ated continuously , resulting in everyday life of dental vene@@ ers through a acute lack of food@@ stuffs and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition were seen in the signing of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; however , however , the re@@ tention of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , collabor@@ ator at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of government decision as follows :

on Twitter there are pictures that tell the disp@@ utes , as well as reports of op@@ pression and failure .
particularly large waves beat the message via police suppression in the centr@@ alised town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back into the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed fears of the government .
hours later she could leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including these women in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira does not bear a tube because they could not see what many national@@ ities did not have !
meanwhile , an Inf@@ ograph@@ ics has already been making up the round that forms the extent of op@@ pression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had the validity of the claim according to a Local procedure - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Labs said :

here is your counter@@ act !

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , a Argentin@@ ean message page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine town of Córdoba .
as a growing man , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes examined , which were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano did not find his life .
it started with the same name as his father to bear the same name as his father to the brutal military ro@@ per@@ ations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
he held his family secrets for 34 years .
in the situation I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a fe@@ as@@ mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years you do not know that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ds and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ v@@ ation .
this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed , due to kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities , who had experienced a boy in the course of the years before the Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child , and like this child chosen for himself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me at the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had made me with a boy , the mar@@ tial sport .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and ur@@ ged me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an Ar@@ che@@ hole , you have rounded you with one from the ERP .
pass the pass , that they may not lead you one day and I must save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolutionary Gu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the revolution@@ aries of the Revolutionary Forces of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be obe@@ dient .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University Stat@@ ements , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda material , books , simple all .

&apos;@@ da@@ h the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la , with everything in 1976 .
at the first and during the last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ter , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little bit of wick@@ edly , and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a large cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar where the stolen objects were taken and under@@ gone me with a guard .
suddenly he looked at an open space , saying :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I put in and saw a lawn , tor@@ tured on humans .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found that it was fixed at the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just fast@@ ed there .
they put a man with hands on the bed , sprinkle with water and ch@@ ased him a cargo of 220 volts to the gen@@ it@@ alia .

the st@@ ank there was det@@ ach@@ able ... as a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell once again and became clear that the smell of a body is in trouble .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a human being able to do so much ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my Father took me for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were fast@@ ed with wrist@@ band and en@@ ligh@@ tened the eye .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people with the face fell down - all were on hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the annex@@ ed people still quiet at the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father knew that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What are you like ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you met me else ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck there a man and killed there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the information given by survi@@ vor@@ s , Jorge Rom@@ ero who also was accused of death in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process to death the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la memorial , through the former follow @-@ up chambers .
the way where you come in here is the way , on which the ones came here .
when you see on the map , you see that they took about this path and then been tor@@ tured for the first time .
here , their names were changed and they were assigned to a number of de@@ human rights .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the po@@ uring of man and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things with home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ fare &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear that war@@ n yield a bay@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military police , which one had to fight against an enemy .

archi@@ v@@ ation
but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ ff , then it &apos;s no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , was able to join this V@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was the officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you whom you hit the car on the road ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded against rage , stroke me , and cried , saying ,
if thou go@@ est so far , I will find you and in@@ able to stand yourself .
we do not need any other !
that was my father .
I don &apos;t have a only good memory to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then on which I bore a jacket and a roller swe@@ ater wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a compassion on this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me on the load what they wanted .
I was anyway , to speak .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of Lei@@ che is the last ab@@ h@@ y A@@ kt &apos;
now , where I am older , I am I Reu@@ e .
I have children . if you have only children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went to say so far :
so good , you did exc@@ itement during the dictatorship of man . but why does the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children lead us ?
one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always turned the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply put them into prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what their bodies shall disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
had these people no families who was handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of Lei@@ che is the last ab@@ h@@ y act , which one can do a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were cr@@ ushed and no@@ where - no idea where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have just the truth about 20 crime times - including my father .
the thought to show my father , was created during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest .
I made him a crime because of all the tom@@ bs which I had to experience because of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt ri@@ cul@@ ous and asked me , why the whole patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ended , actually were good .
then I cried :
how can you say what to me ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have committed a terrible crime , and you have forced me to inform me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what did I do .
in 2010 I received the first display .
I finally knew that he was a bur@@ gl@@ ar .
no one can tell me that I am vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ ious . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , standing before the end of the process .
he was charged with 416 pen@@ alties : among them severe , un@@ certainty imprisonment in 158 cases , murder in 154 cases , murder in 98 most severe cases , torture with subsequent fat@@ alities in five cases , and a case of kidn@@ apping one under 10 years of child .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish order of judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process was committed to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims between March 1975 and December 1978 .
43 The Court found guilty of crimes against humanity , and the court ruled in 28 cases li@@ fel@@ ong and in nine cases of detention between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was acqu@@ itt@@ al .
eleven of originally 54 accused were killed during the trial .

all these def@@ endants were members of the military dictatorship , including former military members , former police officers , former police officers and civil staff .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was ab@@ duc@@ ted along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the welding chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court part is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations which have been working for many years on righteousness for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , who was founded in the Argentine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. who killed the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government was transferred to La Per@@ la , where there was a memorial to be erected there by human rights organisations .

an translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the shield with the translation error at a centre in the Kyoto in which one can extend its driving licence .
the photo was widespread in the social media .
machining of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers were able to extend a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driving licence in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( co@@ rei@@ from sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means , perhaps , perhaps also with b@@ ish back@@ ing &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more powerful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the input field and in the building itself .
machining of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into social media .
the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os , fell down . he was also who made the local newspapers .
the Kyoto writer Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote in the Kyoto Protocol :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an appeal for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply in@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was initially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the reasonable if also the gramm@@ atical was not quite correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ fecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , it declared that the error was already in the text that they had received from the translator , and that the translation was not tested on their judges before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported how follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really sorry that older people were killed by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News took some more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fe@@ ar@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was rejected as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but absolutely reason to worry about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture of Kyoto for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents in seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens caused 1,@@ 8@@ 850 accidents in 2014 .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of senior citizens has risen in the same period .
the nam@@ o @-@ mentioned repor@@ ter brought in the version of the article comments on the light that show what pre @-@ parts some Japanese are apparent against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is it not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the translation is not true , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that the true translation error is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia .
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true treasure pit for this bizar@@ re error in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lat@@ ors are mani@@ fold .
to translate two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active language of the target language - something that is in the native language of the case . generally , the convic@@ tion is that trans@@ lat@@ ors in the target language - not in the language language - native language should be .
for example , a French mother tongue should translate from English to French in French - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ a collabor@@ ating with English as mother tongue to justi@@ fy translations into English . this may be lacking to lack of understanding , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers , the Japanese language .
some companies that have no foreign employees , have translations are fir@@ ing internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best one to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and en@@ chan@@ ted phr@@ ases which arise by machine translation , show that this technique can still replace any human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this is true for several languages .
some of the stran@@ gely English for@@ b@@ ation in Japan , including the av@@ eng@@ age @-@ prints , often uses T @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for sty@@ li@@ ous reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry nor acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by major companies or from the government that have to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses hop@@ efully use a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cen@@ sored measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an Internet users found that they had no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other user wrote that the Internet access by V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are not accessible .
other online channels performed recordings of the protests in Caracas , organised by op@@ positi@@ onal groups , which the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government contra@@ dic@@ ated .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ band@@ ed the Parliament and the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection should be connected , and receive the us@@ ername , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites are again locked again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay in vene@@ ers with Internet access is popular , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been on the reporting of protests since 2014 . at that time the Commission intended for t@@ elecommunications them with money and closing when they continued to report on demonstrations by the Commission as a &quot; Call to Viol@@ ence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net back to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that the still remains cheaper than two litres of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ tro confirmed this later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) is un@@ accessible , but also two more online channels . this also applies to the website that transfers their sessions to the National Assembly .
earlier research institute of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research Group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers can sometimes use DNS . this is a technique that answer the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS server , the server is incorrect or ref@@ using the request for such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ ong@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third switched channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ Camera ann El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who carried out the protests in Caracas , was taken in prison .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was in police custody .
after eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated by the government &apos;s Internet connections , thereby the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians will always be worth access to multi media coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls are too slave to receive a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now they visited the house where they worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimony of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas that were just like they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report from Kur@@ dish , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices by the authors of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ is@@ que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ed cows , verb@@ al schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they were not together with the family who lived there , eat .
shortly before her studies at the University , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride over them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who has become something like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a large family with little money over their min@@ ors son or her min@@ ors daughter to another , rich family . in the thous@@ ch the child will receive food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , however , it is not mentioned that the children can aff@@ ord in@@ numer@@ able days , which will never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of an agreement that you can not raise up .
as a Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice , this practice is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by major parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimony , calcul@@ ating and p@@ aired .
she tried to call things under the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is imp@@ uted to Cri@@ me is guaranteed generally in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
since then , the family , having their daughter in the faith that they improve their apprenti@@ ces@@ hip in society , improve their position in society and giving something out of itself , to another family .
on the other hand the family stands that the girl takes up and its exploitation with faith justi@@ fies that she would have a chance that would not receive any training , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mis@@ ed , his family will only learn many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the sale of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into hospital in Ca@@ ñ@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of severe b@@ lows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of former military members Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as civil servants at the end of the population .
Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck a stone on Mar@@ ín until it suffered a dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stri@@ ped that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest together and demanded that there is no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; def@@ endants Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neigh@@ bors of married couples and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for an investigation .
they want to condemn Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl that their Cri@@ ad@@ ita was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
in case of judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as working forces , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers , in which her father worked , had to register , and her father lost his work .
her brothers had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
thus they had to share the time so that you still remained time for learning .
it was standing every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employer .
on Friday , they puri@@ fied the refrigerator , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and the infected the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
ever they were finished with the learning , the more leisure had her .
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she never had to hunger , but got not unlimited food . &quot; I was able to get more books from the library of the budget as food from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the budget , a former military and sympath@@ izers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was part of the opposition from 1954 to 1989 .
there are some deportation of the goo@@ d@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and see article from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her to convince the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held it for intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the household had found someone who had heard about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they often allowed me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I heard that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a heard that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a heard that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , at home again her native language Guar@@ ani . &quot;
their Lord feared that they had the formation that they had to lose , declares them again .
it was however completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid from them with their hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was dis@@ crimin@@ ated . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken , mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans , of whom Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents know , they recognize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was able to invite you to home . I had no Fre@@ un@@ des@@ kreis in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time , where friends arise , I feel particularly obvious that I was not one of the group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she really likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them .
in the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the state inner that would work &quot; written . &quot;
then , the authors captured the ad once again :
Dear friends , I found one . I look back if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the shop was finished .

&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that was asked to use civil servants and citizens to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of assum@@ ption of the Act , users need to register with their right names and number of staff numbers to allow social networks to use social networks .
if it should be missed , this might be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill that consists of six sections and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video files and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is taken if it is accepted , as the draft does not assume that the Egyptian government is not able to register as the Egyptian government is currently not in the location that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary committee and convey@@ er of the Legislative Decree , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and a password to come by the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on the network to access the network .
but it is not known that such plans exist .
experts and experts in front of the place are sc@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the previous day .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ological ( in German &quot; executive research ) &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , explained Global Vo@@ ices :
I have strong in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they are for@@ ci@@ bly on physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take it , then it means that it may apply a powerful monitoring system to apply for citizens or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of mankind and also to provide a court process .
this is technically no more realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of Parliament and the constitu@@ encies before it goes to the plenary session .
whether his acceptance and de@@ composition will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense is to maxim@@ ized and ensured that no vari@@ ance sc@@ ration has been present on the image surface , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y struck a Legislative Decree against Cy@@ ber @-@ Cri@@ me , which was intended to be found guilty on a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those who are found guilty to threat@@ ening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest to protest . &quot;

this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the contribution is published as part of an agreement for content sharing .
high above in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq work the animal protection of H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the intellectual Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of le@@ op@@ ard le@@ op@@ ards , which are occupied by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are always found because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and fra@@ gment of their living space , as they always find less prey .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining noise in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the th@@ ri@@ ve of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large room is present .
the chance to watch a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in mind is small and goes against zero . when the team set in the video , it shows that they have a great cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs for six years .
the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and focuses on that protected areas for wild animals in the Kurdistan region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o , the progress made for the northeast of Japan , were to re@@ build the life of those in the last six years . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima lost the cat@@ astrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , the pre@@ fecture in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring ov@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished from the map .
even though the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima experienced a nuclear accident , that it was therefore almost 160 000 inhabitants left their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o shows the progress made in local view which have been achieved six years later to re@@ build the life of the area .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese revival authority as well as the survey findings of the subject itself .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( air@@ . , , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened with 70 percent the final light .
although well , six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( F@@ ed , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) was also involved in final spare parts .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , almost 80 000 people saw forced to live in containers .
in December 2016 more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such buildings .
in 2011 , nearly 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in not@@ ices , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in not@@ ices ; more than 75 percent of evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated after the Des@@ aster were surrounded by final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o Newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the mis@@ fortune , its doors will be open until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now again in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have been restored in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , have moved to the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land large @-@ scale in Mit@@ passionate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only a sequence of nuclear power is , because only 690 hectares of about 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered immediately , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima can only be 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o newspaper also reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it has more difficult to earn their lives .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total image , the newspaper led numerous evidence among the local population and under the evacu@@ ated population and among the evacu@@ ated buildings , as their indig@@ nation had changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in the introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o Newspaper :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o led a survey by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the oral @-@ resident population have taken measures to be prepared to future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still not enough in disast@@ ers prevention was done .
as it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ated from pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in their issue to the anniversary of the earthquake the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ implic@@ o newspaper has turned their attention to the location of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience only the mighty earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic , nuclear war , who had to experience Japan .
almost 63 000 people were evacu@@ ated out of Fu@@ kus@@ hima in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in permanent replacement homes .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their native pre@@ fecture .
most of the evacu@@ ated areas are most of the evacu@@ ated companies that are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald , older than 50 years old . it is necessary to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . here , it is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences were first to be bigger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while , we often know that one more combines the first sight .
these global connections are important to demand our perspectives to expand our perspectives and remember that the world eventually ultimately became very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we handle topics that often earn less attention when they earn less attention .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember at a moment in which she felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ ah Camar@@ asa is thinking about the time where she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activity is in artificial com@@ a , after he was defeated by the police near nationwide demonstrations

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years was delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had defeated him in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with an impact on the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest against au@@ ster@@ ity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that rapidly spread across Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures also the face of the police officer , which was identified with an impact force . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the completion of the investigation by the active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he be@@ ats in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would be a police officer of a demonstr@@ ators , and on the intensive care station , his face would be seen for six months in television and the entire suppression would be justified with that .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ural ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz recorded video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several san@@ itation shortly to him .
another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the lower clip you see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to remain in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during the hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here , the activity was assassin@@ ated Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish from his father , because he was attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked at the intensive care unit , after he was attacked by a polic@@ emen who struck him with an impact on the face .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to protest against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rub@@ ber@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
s Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , the police asked to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street protests are tu@@ alised by giving the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window of window .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically over a shred@@ ded glass windows to design their cover pages with a picture .
on contrast , the O glob@@ o preferred one title story with a fire in fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window of over the thousands of people who serve the defense of a special issue .
this also must recogn@@ ise if you are stri@@ ped against any form of non@@ damage .
also here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism , &quot; an ab@@ sur@@ d , distinctive significance , and the typical violence of the military police are caused by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
the For@@ ms of Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alization For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories included the doors to Cuba ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the Gregorian community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the Western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as a Central - on Spanish sugar mill , known that there is no significant sug@@ ars on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were laid down in the sugar cane factories .
after the proceeds , the sugar cane industry continued in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ors of steel and concrete remained left .
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ utes daily to the factories which are still m@@ apped .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dier veter@@ an , who is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep .
he heard that there are again in the east of the region of sugar cane factories which are back in operation after a long time period , because they were preserved .
that was something that he did not expected .
N@@ ene reminds exactly what belongs to that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar tube factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resi@@ sts the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ efficiency , the poor conditions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive on some decades a motive for the country , but the bad in@@ thia are no re@@ productive .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar pipe industry ?
the old railway station of the congregation saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories which amounted to 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the small productivity of sug@@ ars plants and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased before about one decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Land@@ scape subject &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the Economic and Nutrition organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s Day will go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full case for further education .
the same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich am May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , is the word that he is most repeated , &quot; deceit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents have the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
so that the place is preserved , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters started to come .
it was officially recognized documents that only regarding the parts , which would be removed , the address at and the date are distinguished .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the ministers able to recover any discre@@ tion .
from there the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters were more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years for the shut up factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money in operation yet in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the breast@@ plate of the factory , in whose construction he helped , involved .
with each part that he removed , he dismant@@ led in one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ stations was removed out .
in many cases , no alternatives for work stations and services , which were generated in the municipalities in which they were created , were created .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw when he was guaranteed that the factories had no longer work for the areas of their factories for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by mice .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the Gregorian community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things will change , but not always to better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory closed , or better , when they began , they list@@ ened , they list@@ ened to asphalt road , this also list@@ ened to other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant is still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty nights bring a r@@ ents of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a tra@@ verse person , yet he gives the lies , who told him not .
they have been ra@@ ced him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is missing in strength , but because he is bitter .

recording of a Lie@@ ge of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ass@@ y Nar@@ rows First nation .

adolescents of the First Nations communities in all Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do with hip hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour since 2014 , workshop mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ Group The North@@ Stars together .
the workshop is increasing that the young participation in our convers@@ ations as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable , &quot; or whatever is happening in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where teenagers are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the British Columbia province , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ ev@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Y@@ oo is told in the territory of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia , for example the history of Highway 16 , also called Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely modified .
the next video of the Nem@@ k@@ Cre@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate , such as important of the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people have not always rule over the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation recorded the refra@@ in on Cre@@ e .
the young people received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group , which gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ anz@@ he is available in the address , as well as a translation into English that is translated into English here :
sometimes I feel like no one would be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
that is the day that you &apos;ll receive our cri@@ i .
because we lost our way as youth in life
but I think that we will lift up a day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow up and also our youth
so you can do it , as for what it has the Creator .

in Japan you can see almost any restaurant plastic dishes .
to display potential customers , what exactly is on the menu , will be exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( mit@@ ments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each food , which is served in this restaurant .
customers see this plastic gr@@ ate and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry that dev@@ otes itself to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ di@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a multitude of these small enterprises that produce those plastic courts , created by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually that they do not see them even more . a new trend is trans@@ forming to them today in con@@ current mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in N@@ aver Mat@@ omas , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show these unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
now in special sale : new with plastic gr@@ ated steel tubes , as they are shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ ten collecting objects , as in this case , cooling control mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cooling cabinet mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence of essence is increasingly w@@ ished .
in this case , an imperi@@ al @-@ don was transformed into a mobile stand with seafood ) into a mobile stand .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as cell phone support .
we also have produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Railway Station .
and here is an apple that suits your mobile phone :
designed to look like a apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .

on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
is there anyone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can beat my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic gr@@ ated can also accept a less appet@@ ite form to surprise colleagues or family members .

in reports in@@ - and foreign media on the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the ver@@ mis@@ sts and the slain are regularly indicated in statistics . however , these are not the extent of human tragedy that reflect this battle .
the coverage of Drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cartridge , ur@@ ged the stories of victims of conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly any man looking to the sad@@ ness or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each surro@@ unds , behind each bone structure in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds may never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trading &quot; ) , giving this victims a voice and stories of people who were in the fight between the prosecution of prosec@@ utions and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organiz@@ ational crime cannot be afraid of our lives .
the effects are a lot of pro@@ found .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear of life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father that seek@@ eth every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , that was only one day her father , her four brothers and her husband and two of her neph@@ ew lost .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have put forward to get rid of the graves , after the people who have loved us to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electro@@ de in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he was back again , but he never returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , for I am now with three children who need an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who also is with me here .
at the moment she has no income .
you will be the insurance of my father , but he gets not paying her , because they require a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must show the international community the conflicts to reveal the cr@@ un@@ ning and prosec@@ utor .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central alm@@ ex@@ iko .
your contribution is remin@@ is@@ cent of us that you should never consider violence as normal , in which form it occurs :
I have already know disease and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism now for some years .
I come over every day on newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only one , that is wi@@ ped or sad . it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be even valid or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year @-@ old c@@ ousin think that he is great . and it is not normal that people hear about the &quot; hel@@ per &quot; of the offen@@ ders &quot; when they go through the streets .
for me , that , when would they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who have fear , that they would also happen to them .
I see our weakness when stories are to be naked figures in a statistic .
the facts of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were present . &quot;
I think they are trying to speak that they are spar@@ ed from such a tragedy if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. of Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four Mon@@ ths in the Capital of Capital : like a family with dr@@ ill@@ ings . &quot; it describes it as armed crime month for month money from their business , until they had not just destroyed the business but also their family apart .
you think all that you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes , the trau@@ ma remains high , when you are afraid , when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , telephone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
each other we are from each other , the better .
she graduated in the words :
we want to be arrested that the others are arrested , because they do not know when they will lead you or kill .
I asked myself in these terrible days if they would not solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence in generation . &quot;
in the introduction he th@@ rows questions on such as : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexican ?
he is not like other young boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells that he himself had to bring himself like an egg co@@ iled , potatoes and warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ ac@@ on with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left B@@ one - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that ended his childhood .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody bodies of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a pre@@ dest@@ iny car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence through the organized crime and fight against themselves with the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder , according to the number of people to government security and government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only some of thousands of thousands stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; project , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ il@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ il@@ Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose goal is to set the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading , which has changed the country in the last four decades , in a wise manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages , to which he conce@@ als , include pictures , on which violence is represented .
the factor check is important at a moment , in which it is to raise a rum@@ or or dis@@ gu@@ ise a f@@ ake .
but how is the years that has been di@@ pped for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether or un@@ true , tend to stand further .
take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) seven years ago .
since its first release , it has been used ir@@ re@@ mot@@ ely used to clari@@ fy the tragedy that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it th@@ rows questions about messages to News .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , there was a tan@@ ker on the place of S@@ ange in the East of DR Congo , til@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa had been neg@@ le@@ cted for years , and thus devast@@ ated the streets in the region were full of impact resistance , which were difficult to run .
the tan@@ kers fell victim to the tan@@ ker .
the government representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the Football World Cup .
houses ro@@ asted and so@@ aked le@@ es were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ added photos of the precau@@ tion form the gray scenes from this day .
above is an example .
it displays rows of stolen body , which can be found on the ground while they watch them .
but here is the story not their end .
over the years , the same photo had been abandoned several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but they didn &apos;t think that in the context of the tragedy , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am on the ent@@ eous n@@ ig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ enz@@ eu@@ gen reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , before whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and bodies were burnt in streets and bones .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers could not be confirmed but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count le@@ aks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were ra@@ ped , shot or burned .
only based on satellite images the follow @-@ time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained but the army point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the trial of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo was back , as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ sibility ; Africa Check has been docum@@ enting orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass@@ acres .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the picture from the DR Congo will be related to the mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the p@@ liers also occurred in conjunction with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could flee stro@@ kes , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported , Post@@ s like the following on which these descriptions made with photos from the DR Congo brought together :
this picture was taken by a Saudi @-@ Arab news page that claimed 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ a being told , mon@@ ks and polit@@ ician could have been involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition they had used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrated this information .
the original entry , which was last modified on April 26 , 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations , the AF@@ P as their source file , had also said Th@@ ein His testimony , but did not make the picture from the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupling dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually far from anywhere around the world .
using a &quot; converted picture @-@ search &quot; you can see how far information limits can be exceeded .
a modified picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found below 18,@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private pages , platforms social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some are for@@ warded false reports , others have tried to lar@@ v@@ ise the f@@ ooth@@ es .
we have produced examples of mis@@ used use and they associated with the respective countries , based on which site they had been published . therefore , we want the reach more significant than the language alone .
several examples have been associated with each other ( which were also associated together in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be fully infl@@ ated ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of wrong copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ found countries refer to pages or server , above the examples of the f@@ ooth@@ es or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye examples , probably for@@ ce@@ ability examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a Th@@ reads to &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; EN Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Crist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as his source the Spanish News Agency EF@@ E ( which is not known whether the original report has contained the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , such as this , the picture from the DR Congo used to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; obviously no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster saw this .

Malaysia offers two extreme example of ab@@ used use of the picture from the DR Congo , with one part of the sympath@@ y against the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand of a blo@@ g@@ ator , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
in Myanmar , the government of Myanmar published a judge what it came to &quot; ab@@ dic@@ ated messages and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this judge , which is published exclusively in English also contains references to counter@@ f@@ ake pictures of rum@@ ors that were used to kill the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and of extrem@@ ist groups to kill that Muslims are killing and ander@@ s@@ rum ( which often is widely used by Bur@@ m@@ ese national@@ ists ) .

this post which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein denied His 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the picture from p@@ liers .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication , the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article published by 2014 on students who had been released by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic near News page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly explained that the picture was not taken by the t@@ öt@@ ations , but it claims that it had a &quot; similar d@@ ur@@ ic attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contra@@ di@@ ct such connections to Nigeria .

the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and replaced a discussion under Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the stop on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found that events which took place in the name of Is@@ l@@ am , a major attention .
United States , 2015 .
the image has been wi@@ dowed for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ ed ) , but the messages that were associated with no religious context were taken up in no religious context .
instead , the target , attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reports on the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the n@@ ig@@ eri@@ ian Mass@@ acre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; put out discussion for@@ ums like this here on Vietnamese and declared the Fal@@ se message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the embassy in which the picture of the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of a def@@ ective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( based on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data orders with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist at the Web@@ cra@@ wler and ob@@ serving them about image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which has been published only after the original accident of 2010 , the picture is ultimately posted a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or fr@@ ames , which go through this post . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence of Christians by Muslims , or to defense of Muslims - the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as in Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is given in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with this effort .
however , a deeper question is , but what happens if reading this images cannot be longer belief .
with social media there are only people who have un@@ intended to treat the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ars the mood of mis@@ sil@@ ently and fal@@ seh@@ ood that the actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tast@@ es the real estate of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar ?
the dis@@ sem@@ ination images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the re@@ tention of pictures of a ref@@ usal to recogn@@ ise the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims .
at the same time , the concern that for@@ ci@@ ble pictures readers and spectators will take away the ability to feel emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , seeking to help others like for@@ ci@@ ble media to help others ) .
while there is a lot of for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the media media , is fact that they are indisp@@ ens@@ able for today &apos;s news report .
Techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will thoroughly re@@ prove the situation in which a picture has slightly sug@@ ars , which actually can be used by the context or completely mis@@ used species .
any study of false information should also consider to be considered internationally .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able ) lab@@ our@@ able to offer language enthusi@@ astic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in any language : you press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ rul@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others that are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , Spanish so@@ brakes ) .
but all resi@@ sted persistent every attempt of an easy translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
this unique words were collected in an online list for a period of time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and Lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the Blog you can find words of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as follows :

the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the floods came to some areas slowly .
health and hygiene rules of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos have an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water walls of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka has regular updates to high water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .

the Air Force has five planes for rescue operations and another five are made to transport of emergency deliveries to the residents in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 disaster relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood environment and humanitarian aid .

last year after the cat@@ astrophe of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pic@@ Me brought a &quot; high water relief &quot; button to call it users to call a vehicle to pick up support and donations . these were then re@@ directed to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ic Red Cross .
as well , they conducted a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat actions for flood water and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms will be fully exhau@@ sted , residents in need of security and aff@@ ord help .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now the long way to restoration of normal .

photo of Tot@@ ana Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
using appro@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust my four year old daughter , she trusted her children : she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next turn we add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the i@@ kon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound from an American flag , other sc@@ aling par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend looks at me , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this entertainment .
people who have been working or people who have been working for me since years - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their performance .
they mus@@ sels me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practic@@ ed our religion differently .
we identi@@ fying to be a Muslim , on different Art. But somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective presentation , as soon as Muslims who do not clean@@ se it there .
dis@@ mis@@ ed shall be dis@@ mis@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone .
that is even to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come in a sense when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x mus@@ cular pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western presentation the religion was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a major part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the re@@ induc@@ tive pictures of Muslims , the Western books already existed since centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture language is determined by the dark man that should be afraid , and the exotic woman that you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid in the 1970s the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures are still standing today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood are still working .
I &apos;ve worked for three years in the news industry , and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ rative would domin@@ ate our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ att@@ ing the reality that have led nine Muslim women their countries during the last three decades , while the US had not even chose their first female presidential election in the USA .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v fail to recogn@@ ise that if French , Muslim women are going to carry out their head@@ towel in public buildings and forced to cover their entire body to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mighty group ex@@ presses his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks like that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken to American soil by Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who had been brought together with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective pre@@ ference strength low and def@@ ective , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children to the objective of tim@@ ental attacks and ch@@ ic@@ onic attacks .
due to these stories , which we tell and due to the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
and we are di@@ vor@@ ced here , where seven million Muslims who make up the highest degree in America in the highest degree of &quot; religious group in America .
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African American .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my parents went to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jew@@ ellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard into the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ zer were made by the Muslim , American St@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan was rest@@ art@@ ed the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ surrounded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now unknown Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t have a por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or bring my hand@@ ker@@ e@@ or@@ an to bear all Muslims in themselves - &quot; from Resp@@ ect From Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I kid@@ ding , we do not wear all the hand@@ ker@@ e@@ or@@ ane with us .
we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ eng@@ es to combat widespread lies beyond Islam .
these lies are produced on the current band of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ op@@ ent construction of money , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories , which we tell and due to the kind , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger which prov@@ oked the head of the head .
or as the end map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the USA , see below .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its h@@ ug@@ ly forms sei@@ zes our belonging to .
it uses our identity , which is so far so versatile and versatile , that it can fit in a drawer .

use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Muslim power was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they look back on the following terms : believ@@ ing , behaviour and belonging .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior are maybe not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would see my neigh@@ bors , my neigh@@ bor in the Bran@@ ch , that I could see Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept it in my arms , and ye have called the Arab verses to protect the coral , which were called Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat three times each of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pray that they are protected from evil , the evil man that can see and see the evil man that can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is not always visible but my Muslim belonging is always part of my Sch@@ atten@@ s .
the grand@@ mother of the author when she wins a Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with its sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother &apos;s grand@@ mother with their sisters ; as they were able to win a competition of art of flowers in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it &apos;s the picture of her that I slept in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be almost entirely complex .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers that she had said to me , if I have a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a is in it , as she has brought to me , to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God does , my only Lord .
for a people who founded - over centuries - through a &quot; Empire , &quot; which was founded by a company with the name of hon@@ our@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ dien Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only master .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow and hear that men should not weep , but at the same time also to see that my ro@@ asted grandfather cri@@ es .
during his books on the modern Islam and on independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept around his family in India , who ruled the family of India , which he did not close his arms in a half century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart from my grandfather , the Muslim world as the game risk .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first air@@ man in the history was rejected by a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ common , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ ischer subject to British Empire , led by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; when he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were aircraft , he travelled into more parts of the world when I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion belong deep into our unforgettable family . our un@@ questi@@ oned history .
it means that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that apart from all the continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , were divided into Iraq in order to pursue weapons of mass destruction .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ ker buried beneath the ruins of the war .
an American mus@@ li@@ a means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ atorium rose by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy that seek the United States and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the history of four times is more reported than a history with a white attack .
it means that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by an liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , a African Islamic writer named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was sent and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X is a American hero .
it is the warmth that I sp@@ y when people over@@ crow@@ ded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and if we are able to count black life .
an American teacher , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the in@@ har@@ ness inter@@ sec@@ tional ident@@ ities , but to fail to f@@ ails them to others .
the Nar@@ rati@@ v is the 1.7 billion li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood more possibilities than a wi@@ z@@ ards , but it is represented in the reducing branch &quot; against &quot; they . &quot;
a mother to be a mother , to ensure my child and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that ma@@ cht@@ ower and privileged persons are being built on this branch of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ sters that began with President Bush and under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immig@@ ration officials which takes a five @-@ year old child in handic@@ raft .
it is in a country that its borders against people from just across the countries are bom@@ bed .
it is a wrong and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab@@ s and Muslims into the vis@@ or .
we are the wars that we lead and throw bombs in the Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and due to them that we do not tell us , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists showed an scientifically proven image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards the evolution of evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation we must lead
we are too deep to un@@ disp@@ ose the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are decades back to recogn@@ ise the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expres@@ sions that we hide in our news campaigns .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ ard ; the vir@@ al video series Secret Li@@ ves of Germany ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multiply Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ical , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I &apos;m interested in this difficult global time point where we are located .
and this moment has consequences to go out over the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for that con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House lead .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown because they did Muslims too &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has been exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown by making the &quot; others &quot; created . &quot;
a few years earlier it had not been given it ; now they have great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m interested about the re@@ alities and history of which I was not aware of my daughter , as it is now my daughter , but that is now my daughter today .
things I have left here like a bread cra@@ dle in my speech .
things , perhaps remin@@ ders , because in all the inter@@ se@@ ctions that makes our humanity makes a story , where someone is going to be one another &quot; another . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will take place in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not the terms with which we usually throw in our schools or read our newspapers in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how to be led to wars and people through the pro@@ filing of the &quot; others &quot; in the public presentation , four decades even scientific of Stan@@ ford was .
we must present ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of its , deliber@@ ately and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; ; as it is my gir@@ l@@ friend and I have bom@@ bed a new future , where he had already bom@@ bed to us , while he had already capit@@ ulated &quot; people , far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
the initiative for art @-@ art plans to preserve urban language diversity
history of history , of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to join here and now in combination with som@@ eb@@ ody in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories in their original language a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get to get the language variety of major cities .
indeed , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the born children .
for the plan of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we are cities that have not forgotten - safe spaces in which inhabitants are not forgotten to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often it is often associated to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list@@ eners to appreciate , to feel to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format story of history images first put your story in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not professional history , they lead its dev@@ otion and their representation that the audi@@ ences will be on it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emot@@ ion when the language is no longer a barrier .
the subsequent video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the history of history R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou cons@@ ate also the opportunity to clari@@ fy the number of typical customs of art .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ abel of h@@ asen and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having asked the meaning of his f@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience , which does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide atro@@ cities he divi@@ des his feeling of the content :
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were very with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project , can organize with T@@ LS in contact to organise their own story performances .
Puerto Rico calls from the United States to real@@ ise the State of State
with the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organizations involved in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ orial Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the Grupp@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the National Assembly of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ rank@@ ings of the debt of debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is your demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for the responsibility of the politicians and government agencies that are responsible for debts to responsibility for their corruption .
we require a financial examination and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests to public debts , with a firm , our working conditions , corresponding to the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not take place with sin@@ king &apos;s retirement .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the territory of an integrated territ@@ orial area of the United States - suff@@ ers under a serious financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a governmental independent non @-@ profit organization without party belonging to soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed on the outside , without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizen , to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued to continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has made an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital culture , which is al@@ igned to Berlin , dedicated to the event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , an scientist at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher by the so @-@ called &apos; Book spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , l@@ ases out of the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ ner ( The cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published in the last year and is licensed here , contains a series of essays that employ themselves with free culture within the face of the repression .
it is a tribute to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would explain how movements for free knowledge are being built and what the true costs are connected to which this is connected .
activ@@ ist , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , involved in movements for free knowledge , have been working on page to look over the fog , which gives our News@@ fe@@ eds to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of A@@ dra @-@ pris@@ ons , in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we have no information about his present state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that want to release on his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given in this process of tempor@@ ally extreme belie@@ fs ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution which was transferred to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of one of the &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented himself as a Insider of the Assad government and they were drawn by an alleged death sentence against her husband .
but his residence and condition remain un@@ unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia played a decisive role in which access to the Internet and to know the knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently over@@ lap of the leaders of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which established Bas@@ sel writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of bass &apos;s cultural prototypes , as the work that he started to re@@ construct with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civilian populations and the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ful traditions and pers@@ onic influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after being started with this work , the IS would have everything that architecture , not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world em@@ bodies .
this strip is created into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of un@@ estimated value .
in front of this project , Bas@@ sel could not close this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to emb@@ race them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English when he was already in prison .
I learned to read and speak English good .
he always has always shared his knowledge with every one who asked . he has taught English to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also brought other in@@ mates how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they were actually one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ vocation that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book a year .
she tast@@ ed the lyrics , when she visited him , and translated them out of the Arab in English .
the book is licensed free .
book covers Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it is happening on every visit ,
that I sin@@ ks in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the owner in the moment , in which we emb@@ race us ,
that any of the d@@ angers doesn &apos;t matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , arm@@ chairs and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the pris@@ ons of the pris@@ ons
and I &apos;ll be in every detail of your voice and words .
I can carry my passion with me ,
if your eyes say Le@@ be@@ g
and I read another piece of my soul with you ...
I return rapidly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and to weep over your absence , and to smile .
I &apos;m talking about myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
one year goes , my soul
while
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of Monster
bass &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) more than 65@@ ,000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or executed under violence through the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
global Vo@@ ices Community announces the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .

Mos@@ ambi@@ ence re@@ acted with anger on a corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state of State , in which the corruption was committed .
this is where Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants because of illegal disper@@ sion from 54 million Met@@ ic@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) .
the money was taken from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and called immediately his re@@ inst@@ ances in the company , which happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with a position of the General At@@ tor@@ ney of the Republic , which received the application , there was no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , where the company had no discipline procedure after his detention .
however , many inhabitants are not good .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution which was responsible for public transparency , sentenced in an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to introduce the director .
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and interpreted the absence of transparency and is even a return to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we have to know that the company should have a discipline procedure against the contra@@ di@@ pping process .
however , the company is apparent , however , and do not have appropriate legal steps to use the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que of social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as &quot; resist@@ ible &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent case , he would be consultant after having been sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them have taken half .
he could keep talks and motiv@@ ating words , he could be advised and his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has in@@ sufficient to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is expected to be paid for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ers and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he could not believe him , that one would have rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already claimed massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ al to return and to serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only himself served as the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used the state , when hand@@ ele had become an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself , this man was tired , who was pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remind the prime minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a thief belongs to the prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only stay in memory for ever as the first independent President in memory , but also as a sharp , cutting @-@ cutting and by side - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was able to be able to sell his own individual interest to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a amb@@ ition man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is a criminal case . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also ab@@ out@@ dated :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat 10 years and came free .
and today it sets him the company , in which he has been unable to betra@@ y the money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - will be re@@ adily available . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017
Emil@@ do Sam@@ bo by the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( dt : @ truth ) states that crime is paying in Moz@@ ambi@@ que :

Facebook blocks the ra@@ cial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .
the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ aged se .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the famous social network took their Post@@ s from the net because they had the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; ab@@ stain@@ ed .
although on the origin of the word , it is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to humans East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ectively . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook licensed the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ an let@@ tering ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hass@@ elt in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the asc@@ ension of radic@@ ally national movements has given an extreme ab@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation to the Word .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ national@@ ists as Hass@@ elt to Muslims who represent a minority in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight Hass@@ elt in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of sen@@ su@@ re@@ ous content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would usually be brought together with Rac@@ ism , but the word remin@@ is@@ eth not automatically from Hass@@ elt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that they have reviewed or doub@@ ts in which they have discussed the use of the word or doub@@ ts for his use .
there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with basic different mean@@ ings that have the same accounting sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written to Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , what the same letter contains , such as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ aging ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ gn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether they could feel like his back pain when he made his back pain .
the sentence K@@ U la - &quot; Cure &quot; ( K@@ U ) + the Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the assistant expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that they should reduce the radical national@@ ists , but also said that Facebook analy@@ tic must be to spread out all post@@ s that seem to spread out in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it fil@@ ming the word automatically .
the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should be done instead , the post is carefully selected to analyze and check it by sending the words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spo@@ ils ) .
the good thing is that these dre@@ ck@@ ily national@@ ists spread out to Hass@@ elt , a quite good lesson .
now it is at the time to circumc@@ ise their national@@ ism .
while the action would like to send a strong signal to all , the Hass@@ le language may not be able to keep the efficiency of this strategy .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship &apos;s c@@ erv@@ ical networks are often used to start social networks , a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to press their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at was described as Facebook began to qu@@ it his post when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos;s word is banned from the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I became the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards are not de@@ ceased . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posters removed from people who have no negative inten@@ tions , or that simply try to show her opinions against Hass@@ elt &apos;s radical national@@ ists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
post without Hass@@ le speak from Facebook .
in the post , author declared his opinion about why extreme national@@ ism and religious fundament@@ alism are po@@ or@@ ly in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more than the beginning of the initiative , for example the bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a prosper@@ ous intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
such words will be cen@@ sored only even more hat@@ red within the different communities .
in addition , it seems to have been forbidden without any local context or technical support , such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; peas &quot; or &quot; peas . &quot;
even when they found out that they did not have errors , they tried to report the post@@ erior post@@ age .
if you would have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that a huge turnover would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has ensured a lot of fun under users .
instead of being ern@@ ed , users are now funny on Facebook and write the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not in the context of Hass@@ elt , to see whether their postal address will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post@@ s that had no Hass@@ elt , but nevertheless they were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ mes@@ an Text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and can watch the peas and a Indian film .
only to try out whether Facebook is the post , which contains the Word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
in the past five years , extreme national@@ istic ide@@ ologies and religious findings are used to have social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt in social networks have to use violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ en have forced thousands of escape to escape .
Facebook has been responsible for his convic@@ tion that they would speak to his bur@@ m@@ ese parties under control , critic@@ ised .
but rather than just reading the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better working better than in context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finished with the child
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanimously approved a law , which is supposed to offer such practice , so that the age of age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of marriage , some members were du@@ ist@@ ical and mus@@ li@@ stic religi@@ ons in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country gathered , that the state should not mix together , since that the state should not enter the maturity of maturity . &quot;
this happened un@@ counted the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contrac@@ ting partner of the UN &apos;s rights , the minority is defined as people , every man under 18 years . &quot;
the UN &apos;s statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married at 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8,1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Central Central Office of the country confirmed that 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media moves to contest the laws of the children , followed by the feet , followed by great support . und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly , they helped them to bring this result .
nevertheless not all are smooth .
a Hin@@ du @-@ guide , for example had no concerns to say the critics of the children of children , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was actually un@@ complicated for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime there were doub@@ ts , whether the opposition would agree at all .
but early in 2017 , the bill was decided against the children before - despite the 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would do him to the law .
now only the President of the country have to vote and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave a Status update , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against Child before was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
after having decided in the Senate , the draft can now be used for the law .
the majority of the social media user was thr@@ illed because the laws have been changed to children .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was clothed in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and un@@ necessary odo@@ urs used to swal@@ low the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the child is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and that &apos;s almost every price .
while Abel was Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to complete the practice was L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas surprise that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent News !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which said quite openly about it , said :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious citizenship 18 years .
the design for the change in the event was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote .
all members who were admitted to the law have approved for the law .
the child before is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago by law .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ birth @-@ child@@ birth .
many thanks to all activists who have un@@ challenged him .
congratulations to us .
a Dan@@ ke to our M@@ EP@@ s .
however , a possible hook comes in the form of satellite Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du Organisation of the country .
in the months of months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj announced his intention to pursue the judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney in Paris Al ra@@ wi , a dis@@ col@@ oration of the law said , it was quite right when Mah@@ ar@@ aj would like to proceed against the law , most of the social media users would wish to say the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l now struck :
Dear Sat , if we say , instead of the discussion so general , in a way that we would have to talk the state in our sleeping room , simply that they may need of big , persistent , men who are opposite to the advantage , would be mis@@ used , would you be ready to continue discussion on the discussion ?
or do you believe that it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a judicial action against the law , or not , these legislation is an important step - but there are still places on the world where the children is legal in different gra@@ dations or to the norm , although there are laws to tell them .

on Sunday , the Office of the local News Service Y@@ ar@@ News , announced that they have been ro@@ asted .
through the mirrors of websites you can view Turkish user again Wikipedia content
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright laws in the United States , represented internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since more than one month now the popular and on the C@@ row@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as repor@@ ter and fans of TV @-@ series we@@ aving against the locking .
although many techniques used , Internet users are used to use stream@@ lined websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey did not fall the third largest VPN pre@@ valent in the world ) , most unusual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been published by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , will find regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it goes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continue to remain closed , there are several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) as the platform all of the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator links ) , which does not support the system of domain name and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is re@@ adily available despite legal ban .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything that snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents , even if you can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step has been carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only deals with screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i of Wik@@ im@@ edia , Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ kno@@ ck@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror page of Wikipedia , as well as the Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use , to ho@@ ist similar Mir@@ ror@@ sites , when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked .
Con@@ sun@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and collabor@@ ator with Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s open &quot; po@@ d@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you go to another URL that is not the original . that &apos;s what you can see is from Wikipedia .
the server is essentially leading to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ es@@ ian wildlife photographer uses his camera to attention to the need for natural protection

used with permission .
S@@ ill Gir@@ i was with the photos which he looked around , never satisfied . they were missing with po@@ or@@ ated moti@@ ves and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated it himself a camera to wear and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ aber saw himself to bring the international stage to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos those who are attention to the attention of Nep@@ als .
he described on Facebook as it helps to help him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I rested straight at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida ) called me . he had received a call from my Father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river was a Leopard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ rah@@ a .
immediately I went on with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had seen him and showed me the place on the other river , where the Leopard was at and I immediately began making pictures of kne@@ e ! ! !
S@@ aber saw a cooperation with the authorities to recover worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ as nature and would like to deep@@ ening the understanding of that wild animals are not as fur@@ ious as they look .
and he should know , for he stood up from face to face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be dis@@ rup@@ ted from the mind of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was in the dark on the way home , when suddenly the king of the cov@@ et@@ ks appeared . he goes immediately , we see us and star@@ ed me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , the &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife are not always easy .
he was waiting for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to make photos of Ot@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live in the vicinity of the tourist information .

years after the wedding carriage of Indian women for the first time , the names of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

CC B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
this contribution was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally issued on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of an Content Sh@@ aring Convention again .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , use a Pr@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ es@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect to the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of consequences , they should dis@@ mis@@ ate the norm to life this practice .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state O@@ ost@@ a by a spot@@ ted court and destroyed by her family and the village community after she had talked with names .
the tradition of their wives also did not call her name , it is also common among men . however , they have seen far less assign@@ ments if at all , they should not occur in this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including healthcare personnel and household women , a unique club and were thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone where they discuss the host@@ esses of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is designed for the reduction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate community .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s he@@ ats up to the annex@@ ation of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and heads these clubs .
it is reported that these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time at the end of the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini shown in their discussion round , did not call women who did not call her husband &apos;s name .
she has decided for this subject , because she wanted to open the interview about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , which makes women easily identify .
according to the names of their hus@@ bands , it is a bridge that they have not guilty of any liability and never put in question .
Roh@@ ini said :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t keep it , will be regarded as back as a woman without mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we never have made us up to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who has never been named her husband , has never been named at home at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned back to me , and said , I should call him from now on his name .
with this self confidence in the Bag@@ ini , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; ever before . some believed that it was a good cause , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different poems - happy , off@@ ended , sad , lov@@ ingly , and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they may call us how they want , that they may not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day to whom she brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women will never talk the names of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so sh@@ y that it was only afraid of the whole exercise , and another decided to re@@ locate the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by completing it .
the expression on their faces was static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the ap@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ let about that they have broken with an ancient ri@@ b , the women decided that they would actually try to call her husband to name their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas put them in the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ mother in law she was afraid , she got afraid , and said that there was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in case was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported that women have attempted to stop other practices , such as the tra@@ ys of the cin@@ oma red point on the fore@@ head , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ status :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ red point when he had it .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard that I was able to bear him .
the other women have not completely ceased , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose it even in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets .
&quot; we make a trip at every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to make the women who could hear what could hear , &quot; says she .
during the last months , she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and spoke about things that they had never made thoughts .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , as well as our ident@@ ities are linked to our hus@@ bands , never so hon@@ est .
it feels great to say certain things according to say , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we are talking about the concept of glory and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , the okay , but some wanted to have a sal@@ ine c@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , they did not be dar@@ ed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the ex@@ cer@@ pts of your own hang@@ ers , the Mor@@ al is connected to the sar@@ is and much more , tasty Roh@@ ini her own couple Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that women could bear them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to make it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has been changed , Roh@@ ini confirmed that the things are slow to roll :
we have made only small steps to date .
some women tried it a few times , but then list@@ ened to her husband &apos;s name .
some , including me are still , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women have now carry on any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the line to navigate more freedom of movement or own h@@ anger - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how raw explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change anything .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman goes home to home and other people , what we speak and what we do .
we sit all in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping , probably for super@@ se@@ ful purposes , presumably for super@@ faithful purposes , the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province of Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the Pra@@ k@@ tics .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in Mil@@ ange district , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and killed in the sequence that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there is the local super@@ st@@ ition believe that the head of a gl@@ itter@@ ing man &apos;s gold is un@@ old or wealth , declared the police officers of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the aim of ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this resulted in that the UN led a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice in the South African country .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government of campaigns developed to combat these super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ conception .

two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the h@@ ort@@ ation took place .
H@@ uss@@ ene Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , Student and inhabitants of the city of In@@ ham@@ burger , south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police told the case :
PR@@ M believes that the Sh@@ aman are involved in the death of the gl@@ itter@@ kö@@ y men .
the persecution and killing of smoo@@ ther individuals for the profit and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ wa , for probably aber@@ ration rit@@ u@@ als , has taken care of cultural moti@@ ves ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims could have power in the head , the wealth of wealth .
in the last days , three men with hair@@ y problem were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ g@@ ator arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa that is clear that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , in which Moz@@ ambi@@ que is opposite :
I would like to give E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , DAS S@@ ICH - a country where the teachers would have thought to give sex against good notes , and other achievements to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os still k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ ues for super@@ se@@ ful purposes or &quot; black Magic &quot; to get to those who aim to pick up their wealth .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably recently made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published in the framework of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to the hospital due to liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state @-@ end@@ anger@@ ing ) , after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that had been involved in the democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ us Case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker tells it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to get calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow or to allow a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely out of the theme .
Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad for a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ende are refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was awarded to Li@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government divided nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations were first continued in December last year . in June Norway signed an agreement to record the salmon left to China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the message was widespread that Li@@ u was serious , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an un@@ conditional release of the expression and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
because of his detention , he was not able to meet his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ acy of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called China also called Li@@ us , as she ha@@ sted in a statement on June 30 :
we expect at the same time that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they must meet all visits and receive them that wish they wish , and able to communicate freely with the outer world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad declared that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; US ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , so that he would have to help him in his gen@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message of the AF@@ P on 27 June , that the embassy decided to release the Chinese authorities , not only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the review of the US Embassy moved to China , with the creation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to make a unique and un@@ answer remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Poland shared with that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as travel sick@@ ness and access to medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to Chinese constitution and legal status as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the congress to dr@@ ills the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditional .
I needed China to attend the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditional , so that he can teach in a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Li@@ u , &quot; all the medical support , he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing on the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns , whether the host could survive the visit in Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China required to provide a reasonable medical care and to give it the opportunity to make sure of his family .
Li@@ us advoc@@ ate AF@@ P previously reported that Li@@ us woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you :
Canada calls China to safegu@@ ards its international human rights issues , including the freedom of freedom of freedom of freedom and safegu@@ ards the rights of these rights .
France
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked China in an explanation on 29 June , Li@@ u from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o all treatments receives , which he needed , regardless where , his wife and his family can have contact him .
although the news releases France Info already reported that French government would be welcome to the country of Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave no further information about whether France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
the Council of the land@@ land@@ marks in Taiwan requested China on June 27 to Li@@ u , and to demonstrate a greater tolerance compared to those who demand peaceful resources to demand political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the t@@ ai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u from the reg@@ al Democratic Party Party called China to allow China to allow sick intellectual li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself very careful in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u and gave that many asked him to pray for li@@ us prosper@@ ity .
he spoke about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that he took and received strictly punished , to a harmon@@ ious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt very moving and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , which stands for democracy , freedom and legal nation@@ ality in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be stup@@ id as an independent state since Singapore has been recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am was to be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at a meeting of the international bi@@ gs of the State Chamber of State of New York , the minister , that many people saw the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because it was compared with other countries .
he under@@ stands that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has put in question whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , whereby most people go an error .
I tried to explain that we may be different .
we are a city .
we are not a land .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to make &quot; logic &quot; to defend the existing authorised exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and essays to create this valuable country , you hear that we were not any country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibility , a mandatory infr@@ in@@ gement .
Singapore , if you are not my land , whose land is it then ?
the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am led reasons were not very Nobel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which , he appeared in@@ sof@@ ten .
in contrast , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democr@@ atically democr@@ atically elected .
once you reach the core point of the Them@@ as , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian Mach@@ th@@ ab@@ ers will be back to be able to aband@@ on the Democrats , since it fits better to their power .
in the final effect the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am was given answers to his American guests concerning our press , our J@@ udi@@ th@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
relevant issues tar@@ ry with non @-@ responses .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit rather difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is no country , but a city is , so in which country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grat@@ eful when our new K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point if it was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog of his comment , he points on the critics that you should start to read the whole text of the conference in order to understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city , and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ necessary , even if we are looking for free and righteous elections .
he spent Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t know it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes a leader of a her@@ eto@@ fore @-@ growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I &apos;m talking about what was said to the Minister of Justice in Singapore ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old yar@@ n that I expected to do with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doub@@ ts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is really associated and is aware of what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review distor@@ ted the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher ?
if Singapore is not a land , we are only regarded as independent and sover@@ eign state ?
if not , on which country walk the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government sector , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am is serious importance .
why do I aff@@ ord their military service to defend their own city , but did not defend their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizen of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
then , the German magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the evidence , Singapore is always a town :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have a lot of chess more expensive ...
no one has ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; defense of the country above all &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite correct .
we should speak rather from the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most miss@@ able aspect of the most miss@@ able aspect of your home or hom@@ eland ?
your answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question which is set to me in Japan , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ans@@ wer me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his talk partner by making personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication then the default answer is : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadian , perhaps cook in front of rage , if they are kept for Americans , but do not distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there are little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadian players get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadian .
American on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began 20 years ago through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before entering into Iraq and before the 11th of September .
Canadian players have already borne little A@@ hor@@ n@@ ets on their baggage to distingu@@ ish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons in us !
gender equality are legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we say obviously very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends , which I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would mean nothing if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signi@@ fies , is in the reason to be di@@ ligent - like the sh@@ ear , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada is really a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; cute &quot; has no personality .
there is no corners and edges , nothing at which one can stum@@ ble .
harm@@ less , is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and unexpected to earn and no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that happen around one .
I &apos;d even go to say to say that the desire to be free and only to be one of the Canadian player .
we tend to worry about our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadian speak not often over the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we are missing the warm warm , open friendliness , which I connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadian player is more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made a look at sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed in Thailand Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has published a music video published by the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and to restore the civilian government in 2014 , continues to re@@ igns the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about it his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly polit@@ ically , the music video refers to the continued military dom@@ ination of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was awarded by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook with 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ist the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to the Thai policy , in particular , as with the situation in the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at once these photos of the videos , which relate to some of the political issues , which have persecuted Thailand in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , representing the commander of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commander of the army &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obj@@ ection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the Act on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to understand activ@@ ist and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , the online content monitors and persons whose monarchy is accused of having the monarchy .
Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ful voc@@ al against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d .
one of the problems which continued to continue the Jun@@ ta is their decision to buy U @-@ boats , although security professionals they war@@ med that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste from tax collectors .
in the video , as well as people are thrown into a black delivery van before they bring them into an inter@@ ni@@ ying camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison because they supp@@ os@@ edly causes &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet users are threatened long adh@@ esion , they should serve the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the te@@ aser of the band members &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; showed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; had already been cited during the protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the post @-@ war company recovered only very slow in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian War officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ pool of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , sh@@ in@@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ er and Armen@@ ians lived and worked on the Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements will also be called spirits in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people still lived there are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic for t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16,000 people , after they had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; this is a result of war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ schu@@ k@@ ow@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to end this .
&quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk with you ? &quot; why do I speak ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens which served all the community .
now there is only paved road with bl@@ as@@ est spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived on this place and their contribution to the central economy of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ov@@ kas , which is still one or two families , recognize one on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera , they draw back immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed somewhat with her friend and suddenly leave the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetables .
it is difficult to come about the laps .
the District Administration is free of candles and bread for the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build the zu@@ cchini . &quot;
ten years ago , a older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt gene , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to the jung@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
Gal@@ ina would not want to accept any financial aid from her daughter , and hope that they are supporting their young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a sweet garden even a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot;
t@@ ante G@@ em tells that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holiday are , we are visiting us .
but we cannot do this with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears in the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; call@@ eth t@@ ante G@@ ite to her . &quot; they said , we could build a zu@@ cchini .
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build the zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; one can get to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talks in Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and the five common children lived in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they are remin@@ is@@ cent of the village in front of the war .
in spite of the relatives that live in central rus@@ sia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the land Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke off ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; explains it .
Nat@@ ascha receives a $ 9 child for each child .
her husband is working in the spro@@ ut .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as nurs@@ ery was at once , they hold pigs , cows , hamm@@ ers and chick@@ ens .
it is told that there was a very anxi@@ ous situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost their fears .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people .
you can get to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it rather has something to do with pill@@ age .
after the war there was no work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation is at the end , a little boy is over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ased him .
he plays with the ball , then leaving the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them stones relate to the dec@@ ay buildings .
this ruins are part of their childhood which ensure un@@ certainty in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; Mig@@ rants in her long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , at the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was released on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican female , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink brilli@@ ant and gold colored ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa .
this top name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the journey .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with grinding , ab@@ um@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us the people in full small bus@@ hes and from the upper part of the coast to call her : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the time it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on boxes .
she wants to re@@ ject it .
she helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they bought them medic@@ ations that they cannot pay to them , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable top name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ost@@ al ) posi@@ ums with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to come to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are in the United States to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north .
the family had heard of other Weg@@ ener from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a Guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kaner often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans speak already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of its captivity , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to get the bus terminal to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact us in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reply he sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send text messages when they went to gr@@ ate them or to report about the course of their journey .
it explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps well known here , but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , S@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family took part in their small house .
he is polic@@ emen and has found that the Bust@@ ick@@ ets are sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; says he . &quot; I have experienced what they can experience .
I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his working place .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted money back to have a plan without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked after an accommodation and a unknown , one of all , has offered her roof .
a few months later the family lives there and attempts to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all full of guests .
in the course you can consult the traveler quiet@@ ness their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is filled , but it &apos;s also nost@@ al@@ g@@ isch because of them that went away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , they cut them in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ pin , which you did a Kund@@ in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ s sad , while they set them shortly .
&quot; Ya se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeated every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their mobile phones to install a surveillance app .
check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter user .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phone .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi was able to install a cell notification where it shows the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
in the notification it is said that the app will be able to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ n@@ ate the authorities to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia were arrested 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app .
in the notification of the police , that the app will determine the sources and the distribution ways of the terror@@ ists and prosec@@ ute , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fr@@ aud , and Ph@@ ishing pages to make user atten@@ tive to users how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network .
this App with the filters for min@@ ors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can be used in different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker is able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications of digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly concentrated on the experience of users in the East and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , op@@ aque ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit the un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet management .
that is based on Twitter @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from the Fair China &quot; ( F@@ EST ) , published in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen the residents are immediately checked if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that the people will install the app within 10 days .
if you have discovered a Check@@ point with one device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a retreat for technological development .
they are forced to use devices that are intended for older people to use .
this is a form of captivity by the transfer technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( 50 @-@ acre ) , also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product description , that the software is able to raise the code requirement of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard disk of the computer .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell@@ phones are in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic manu@@ als .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city party Council , minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal content .
all government officials , authorities and associated institutions including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report from Freedom House , an US @-@ American Human Rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks , and media @-@ storage cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obvious to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy them . this promotion does not viol@@ ate the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ o that you are quite alone on a place where everything is gone missing .
everything has become dis@@ band@@ ed and dis@@ band@@ ed and a truth revealed that it is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one who makes her name all glory .
one that has to be found in a list of feeling and squ@@ ee@@ zed that no met@@ aph@@ ors allow .
but when you come back into reality , and look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actor - turn the characters in beings from meat and blood , and all cri@@ es after death .
all doub@@ ts are in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is going on the axis of the Holy One . it is clear that you are captured here between the walls that are your parents , and before them thy grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have arrested me and arrested my father three times , but that was not enough to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how the chief of the Security Council formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he presented his power over us under evidence that he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five yo@@ ungst@@ ers were torn apart during a peaceful protests such as Un@@ k@@ raut in the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to cut the town the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ write .
all the neighbor@@ hoods sought , just my own .
for the first time it was still quiet , to the wrong time , even if I have no high demands on a city set up to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their complic@@ es .
in the third night the things had something soo@@ thing after the power supply had ceased in the quarter .
I broke the silence , by I cried several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were cour@@ age@@ ous enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends included me ; we banned us to a glorious image that had filled my expectations and all filled .
in such a moment it is aware that you are delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the Ger@@ ing@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can teach you , nothing can return to your voice , after you have done it all the way until the office of the safety service from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I joined there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you are &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his water filled eyes were erected on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are looking for yourself to look at my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so what I did , nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps there was foolishness of my foolishness ; maybe in the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I don &apos;t thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never heard you to see you in eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fat@@ ale consequences for me , and though I have no word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father just with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this cursed proposition is far from me until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ian torture that I had been exposed for months .
I am going through the court .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the court and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells .
I have all the details exactly one before I cared for the room .
other than otherwise they did this time a larger cell .
I have to share it with only one single prisoners and may immediately set me immediately , without waiting for its permission .
after a couple of minutes who felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I laid upon an old communication method : using the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that my Z@@ ellen@@ ra@@ de was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awak@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long public@@ ans he finally responded to me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells , a prestigious man mean age , which looks similar to me and is called &quot; doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there is no distinctive fac@@ ars , and physi@@ cians don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone who sounds like my voice ? &quot;
all answers a existence of his existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investigations had as@@ sures me , they would fre@@ eing him when I abide .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
I would like to drive a bird , to drive all these c@@ rows , which lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; out of the distance .
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the colour of this is , until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the tomb in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; to play on the 13th S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; you are here to hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the terror@@ ists and the terror@@ ists in us , they played their con@@ cre@@ atic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fin@@ alist war card and conce@@ aled the narrow viewing field of its world view .
this is not a house that is here is not a country ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ ence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound in a hero .
I support the audi@@ ble room and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a slim and peaceful man ; at least he comes to me so before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; con@@ vers@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you are still young , you can join so much Import@@ ant with your life when you &apos;re going to protest this day when you will soon find an end soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I answered not .
I was able to answer it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say more precisely , when Bel@@ ei@@ er@@ als and sl@@ ings have become a friendly conversation for me at an ordinary communication .
when and how that happened , was in@@ important .
any voice in me told me that I had to be punished or bad , though I had done nothing to earn this sentence .
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to rip so much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably dates from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker invite you to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you can &apos;t stop your cry .
my cry fell on him not enough , why the pipe had sent out the tube through a cable .
in my first arrest I asked me if the investigations had worked earlier times as a gar@@ bage dump or whether it was one of the normal working equipment .
they had four cables in each other , to present ourselves out of their sight , great invention of a huge cable .
just changed three of them in one hour while I was still working on the series .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , why I heard to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker knew the cooling and found no pleasure in all , why he is the next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power leader .
the Tau@@ ber disappeared and the pain was again .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must probably have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again , let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours walked , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to dawn .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answer with the voice of one exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father has to make a terrible wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an@@ ic Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speaks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cig@@ ar in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text , recorded .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brings the most of his time into the inside ; it divi@@ des his screen to his computer , and again to his couch .
what you can rely on , a cig@@ ar can discover between his fingers or to discover his lips with nic@@ ot@@ ine .
he lives in the top creatures of his family house which had heard them since 1967 ; the year , in the Israel his occupation of the West Bank finished and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ low@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmer ) .
since now , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist , who was transferred to the conservative majority of the conservative majority of gender reels , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression by art and rap@@ music .
with its music , often marked with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he calls not only in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man that is not restricted by the borders , and he can feel free according to its own statement by the people who have to suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he is not open , he is a special dis@@ rup@@ tions for the US Foreign Policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas where he was born in Jordan , even though he was born in Jordan , even though he had never been born in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then adds : &quot; I think so because I &apos;m a man , while He dissolved the nest @-@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise until sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an illeg@@ ally .
apparently H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has a sen@@ sel@@ ess Jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
in principle we speak the mud of the warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ den of the K@@ ent cigarette case in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you cast a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it simply avo@@ ids to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an Water - to cross it in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some par@@ liam@@ ents that support the Islamic State Court - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ tier Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country is contra@@ dic@@ ated and the main reason for the concert .
the members of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the sin@@ ner .
many claim in addition , the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be hazardous acti@@ vis@@ m , which demonstrates the old legitim@@ acy of authorized regime in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a became the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of Human Rights , &quot; which continues to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to move the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually an evident @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ine reality reflected in Jordan that occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender standards sent to the body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women , which have vo@@ des@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who have actually confidence .
in Jordan the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ de &apos; has increased - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ or of Hon@@ our in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan was missing , the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women , the victims tried murder or domestic violence to support appropriate manner .
according to a law to decline in 1954 , women who are subjected to the danger of a family @-@ family force , &quot; and for their release is often a lon@@ ging bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing .
even H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is looking forward to great popularity and is well known to re@@ mot@@ ely in his country as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b states that his work is polit@@ ically , but dre@@ amed that he &apos;s his music that is full of explicitly related to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically polit@@ ically , can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market that you can get in his words , &quot; that one can get what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ faith , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that barely any one speaks in Jordan over the rights of spon@@ ges and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still have been put into force until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an@@ ic online program Ro@@ ya , to notice later his comments from the context of the context , and his opinion was cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded up@@ loaded , but was only a revised version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arabic L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of homosexu@@ ality did not say to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ evo , a poet of the eighth century , who still has stayed in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ evo was going to work once again in the order of the cali@@ bre , in the eighth century , why Jord@@ i could not write it ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion and that progressive voices will be silent .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news services ordered several former government representatives and members of the teachers of teaching , with the grounds , they would have been critic@@ ized on comments in social media , which contra@@ dic@@ ated with the deep in the country .
in view of this is the H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion , only the tip of the ice - the actual challenge is to have a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier .
for him , progress is a permanent enter and take place in a row for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - it consists of slow , need and in@@ active changes . it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society will take place .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams like millions of other Arab@@ s , from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he dreams not only to bring his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region &apos;s help of music , art and literature of a real and basic activity , and not through bombs , stre@@ ak , and artificial kind of running democratic . at least he hopes that .
until it is far , h@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue for@@ ging and therefore also aff@@ ord resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man belongs to the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant soldiers are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories as regards the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that there is a version of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which was also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory shows that the drums , drums and dancing over a thousand years have been delivered from the west of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi near the kne@@ e .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b a few great seats , therefore we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( Sum@@ t@@ l ) .
I have been looking back to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just a long time .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival will take the only truth - and to spend a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and got the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high festival was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely we were outer appearance and body care as important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitim@@ ate job as the fresh@@ ness course .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us major port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoking and illegal drug trading are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - as many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services .
the trend , the appearance and appearance of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dressing into the experienced hands of hair@@ dresser who can form them up .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ dresser who go to the utter@@ most bound@@ aries of fantasy and creativity , has even been inspired by an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dressing your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts each other to show that those who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ri@@ fied L@@ ooks like one can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions there is on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to discover their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated from this activity and the possibilities have dozens of young people saw that they can sei@@ ze a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the beginning of March , and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the community and the district which we are very proud of which we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ age
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the Beit@@ ra@@ gs &quot; Liebes@@ message of Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ claimed , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this contribution will be published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel out out , aff@@ ection to meet ?
exactly this question went on the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation &apos;s Young Youth Foundation ( Letters to Re@@ conc@@ iliation ) , young people to encourage young people to write Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ quires letters .
just before short , her country was a historical event , and they wanted to contribute their part : after a long negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ a@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International applied for the signing of the peace agreement as well as important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its services .
however , in front of the Colombia , there is still a long way until you can speak of true reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , and around the clock continued to integrate their weapons into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society turn into the life in constant fear , and in some cases deep@@ ened hat@@ red against gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ings , these now have to be taken into their ranks , and support them to the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young column should join themselves together and help the integration process .
and exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ claimed to welcome them again in the society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ aries who should be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the man that we love to write on the Valentine &apos;s Day of love letters , but those forget that they need a lot of necessary .
he plan , he told him to share his love with people who needed the most ur@@ gent commitment .
so , the plan , letters of hope and support for the former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now will find their place in society and to create a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history about a common history of peace . &quot; they say .
to date , more than 2000 letters were collected in the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art re@@ ists to store the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were so on how they had done earlier , to meet the commands of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of under@@ tak@@ eover of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all parties . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between me and all that is between , and the political science student Bet@@ ty Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so :
after we had delivered the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa com@@ fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of cottage in which the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ claimed ) saw it , I saw a gu@@ er@@ ill@@ iter@@ ate that wrote something .
I was afraid , because in addition to him there was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ egran@@ ates , a dead@@ ly weapon in the village of Dor@@ n@@ avy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they just ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , someone wrote something so nice , so do I answer it . &quot; and suddenly there went on tears over the che@@ eks .
I em@@ bra@@ ced him entirely , and set me next to the pom@@ egran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry that he was sorry , all the years of the faithful companion of this fighting would help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never joined the life as a war . the F@@ ARC was the only opportunity to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society without waiting for us .
until now I have learned how I have to handle weapons .
but now where peace rule , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as a war , and the F@@ ARC had already been in secret places .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC history explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help us to create society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for an objective of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people , who had not yet found hearing and had no elec@@ toral law , and to know that people who often have seen as monsters , and even had learned people with beautiful poultry who were turned through their life and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , do me hurt .
but comfort me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage caused by us to bring us something like a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian column was made that after de@@ fo@@ al peace would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons and to protest their rights . and this is completely justified ( ... ) .
we now set the F@@ ARC now on peace , on a policy without arms .
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology , they belong to all the people that dream by a country in the war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution , and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are coming .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talking about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the lives of Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article , which was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mac@@ sum@@ owa , and its first published on the OC Media website .
hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a large bandwidth of d@@ angers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ pressing .
with hor@@ ror , activists of the last months over the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that is based on the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community is not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ y who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about us what currently happens in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months after reports were published , killing torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta , and she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , suspected que@@ fied que@@ fied men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a transition , was born in Gro@@ z@@ abad and grew up there .
already since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a saf@@ er place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ et@@ ians had learned about the sex , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life , she moved to the USA last year .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunte@@ er hel@@ fer@@ in with a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ wife that was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone made a friend of my documents , and spread them everywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture from me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents made by all W@@ hat@@ s@@ App round the round .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I had just returned a couple of shopping m@@ ashed out of the seat of my car , I heard a male im@@ me : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt anything in my body , but I did not hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the final end of the hospital in the hospital again .
apparently some women had taken everything and began to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had a nurse .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two samples in my right lung .
OC Media : in whom nurse were you laid - in men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name &apos;s name ; but the physician stood and laid me to the women .
I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time on his office , I got it with fear ; it was a mus@@ cular , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he has gone fully with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
I got thre@@ ats in the last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stranger , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ fall .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the desired , send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie .
they exhibited ab@@ sur@@ d demands : some told me that I would have to prove it up through the streets ; others wanted to say that I had not changed my family in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ y , and that I had not changed my sex , and Photoshop .
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to move with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people said once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family but the whole Republic has damaged . &quot;
we can not touch you because you are a profitable wife , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she felt a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neigh@@ bors and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I went into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dark window discs and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear that there was a little la@@ zy .
my right @-@ right friends tested the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I want to remember them all remember ; they really have helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belief .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without sign , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the gar@@ bage .
arrived at and check@@ te into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in safety , only because you have forsaken the country ?
our people already know , in which hotel you prefer . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about the sex , but this is a table topic .
some traditionally Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements I still bear in me .
so much I wish to be able to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
if we ch@@ ased with camera , I really give me trouble as the person remin@@ is@@ cent of their past , thus remin@@ is@@ cent of my male shape .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for whom I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who had to eat one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that Ram@@ ad@@ an had no man arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an did not wait , and he completed a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
so , my I , they probably invite you to contact the problem with the affected person and at the end , a evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; has experienced by blood .
OC Media : are there still pregnant men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says , there wouldn &apos;t be many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , in particular , those who have no rich relatives or dropped from their relatives to imagine Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know , they will be held there , so you can present them as terror@@ ists later .
say : should they be converted to show her body in television and claim that they would have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not just missing , but also di@@ pped specifically to radic@@ alize .
OC Media : is that just a delay or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just returned someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun in a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after all of you had grown .
there was nothing new from them .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , these person was taken away as these people were taken away .
but until now they were not presented as band@@ its , in addition there were no reports yet , but we are not possible that such actions are possible .
why else should I not allowed this man to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and performances of people who have a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I have always married my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ y , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria had been considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safe as now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , however , he finally cast us into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria Act ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were bo@@ iled ; I had coloured lashes , wore Rö@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short t@@ ops .
the Ministry of Security of Sch@@ aria never has a hair curved .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ abad there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met as me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and all the city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never besi@@ eged .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ are not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it often says to children , if the sick people are fun .
OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes before you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never off@@ ended , never ch@@ ased and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long kept this gifts time ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al .
he spoke not over us by se , but above the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change .
who was angry , and laugh@@ ed at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily slow@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now after ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US .
apart from which I am still working as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ated with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , together , I wish to get them to the hospital and help them to get the essence of essence .
I don &apos;t forget any cent for it .
I have discovered this people when I flu@@ ke a refuge .
I &apos;m Mus@@ lim@@ a and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ lied .
so nature is the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ ians who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no weak@@ ening with them .
those who have so far , the Cab@@ ard@@ iner have those who have Russians also , on the entire planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is impossible to hear what to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque , and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an keys - live together with men .
do you know , many thinking about tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ aries to men who love men and believe that you have to do his family to make more in@@ time experience . but that &apos;s a Tru@@ g@@ inal connection .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensitivity to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed to my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I personally become so personally , but my last in@@ time relationship is now longer than one year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I know that I am now myself .
local groups in front of an increase of self @-@ moral within the promised Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty level within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase of self @-@ moral .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the des@@ per@@ ate situation of Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the ramp light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered under Ang@@ st@@ resses , depression , and em@@ itted himself for his own help , the ability to come up for his family , Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Human Rights Groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous .
one on YouTube shared video held the moments after he had kindled itself .
some people created it fast to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only self @-@ committed suicide in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists war@@ ns that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights told that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all family v@@ ä@@ ter who , due to the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess , and un@@ capable of forced their families to nour@@ ish and safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is located in the majority of Iran &apos;s living Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a mainly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and 1925 to finish the ethnic autonomy of Iran .
in Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the greatest in Iran &apos;s coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most powerful and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continued only slowly , and the local population gets only little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and kidn@@ apping .
the Iranian regime refused T@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ s systematic jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are to lead .
these dem@@ me have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region through drying , and local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ yo@@ ungst@@ ers increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for Ko@@ operative , work and social welfare , applied that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who completed a work school , has completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; to destroy the Spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high rise in the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since Fun@@ ctional and institutions are non @-@ Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is able to have access to the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i access to all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which ab@@ stain@@ ed to destroy the Spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to make them to earn their lives outside of their hom@@ eland .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and to be toler@@ ated , since even Arabic names are not toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the speaking of the Arab language or the tra@@ verse of Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to carry out human rights activists before the situation is explosive .
it remains un@@ wait , whether the world will wake up and being aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treated and committed suicide .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not I identified with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am no femin@@ ist , react many women - especially white women who draw themselves as an internal femin@@ ists - with fr@@ ust .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even use well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be any femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under controversi@@ al observation , if it goes on what they are doing with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epi@@ demic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women so@@ cks earlier or later in various fields of life to a smooth blan@@ ket , and that discrimination is still across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on Black C@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community , or on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community , or on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q @-@ Community or on a black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community ; if I &apos;m interested in which type we were physically , se@@ el@@ ically and verb@@ al . if I chose to keep many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
however , however , all women , that women - all women - together should come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that it is in addition to sexual violence a institutions form r@@ assi@@ stically motiv@@ ated violence that we are exposed black women to two times .
or in fact , black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and country homes less earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migran@@ t background more often the school is rejected as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women suffer from a higher risk to suffer from a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women .
on the other hand , I want to join all the women , all men and all the people every man . on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect to a movement in whose center the white woman is refused to take into account the ini@@ quities of their thinking as well as on the skin colour of one person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and I &apos;m not more about my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sp@@ y strug@@ gling , who always denied me and in@@ numer@@ able other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ cks accused 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also I refuse to justi@@ fy an ide@@ ology in which the black woman in a historical resp@@ ect@@ ful and mar@@ gin@@ alized beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which is also absorbed by cultural demands of our customs and customs , to describe their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will not try out of white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honour one better .
although the Inter@@ governmental Femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different interest , and ab@@ stain@@ ed by white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I &apos;m going to join me full and entirely of femin@@ ism , who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of myself for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , which is so tough that inter@@ sec@@ tional phenomenon is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and give us into the sp@@ ouses that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana bl@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves to our own kind . and not only the - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , se@@ el@@ ian , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements can be consumed , which make the black woman .
although some white and internal femin@@ ists are immediately called separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , please inform you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ di@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures , because in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my life as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can bl@@ ossom in an environment where my life does not exceed , nor igno@@ red , nor denied .

Paraguay women and their difficult battle against violence
a group women presents &quot; The crying women &quot; to make their pain over the women of women in the country and in the region to express their re@@ jection .

the following article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) that reported about the certainty against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect people affected .
a police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent , company .
since the end of her relationship had passed over time and the police said , her statement would not be put to the ac@@ claimed but even more could not do .
as a further Ms. Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mist@@ re@@ alizing , the ak@@ ten@@ ant ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
a few days later the second woman went back .
the Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ator of violence against women is difficult .
if women want to display at all once , they do not receive assistance by the state .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on the men which they do mis@@ use . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to ad@@ mit the victims of violence to report to the prosecution of criminal authorities .
infusion 1 b@@ lows and Statist@@ ical 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ sing and a legal system that nothing under@@ n@@ imm@@ t@@ 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , man@@ age@@ ous implementation of sl@@ ings and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women really mis@@ sil@@ ently , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that they do not have to show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there were over 70 % of them in case of domestic violence . at 70 % it went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace . 86 % of the ads were recorded here .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically mis@@ sil@@ ently , 55 % of women spoke of mental missions .
however , these statistics show not the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i , only a few of these offen@@ ders are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who are reim@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay for mental missions , come 9 women who do not do this .
on any woman who are reim@@ bur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , declared it at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an independent criminal cases , the prosecution of prosec@@ utions may not be adequ@@ ately documented , such as many women each year of their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to its estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman died out of violence through men .

invisible Mis@@ sing and a legal system that nothing takes
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all of her former friends .
at the beginning she did not want to do it , but then , after that . this should always be ber@@ ed for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but two years , they carried out the psych@@ ic violence against women , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe :
I never thought that I would like to be victims of missions .
if I have read earlier about it , I thought that only women happens to under@@ go , because they are ignor@@ ant of violent men .
I was convinced that it would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the failure by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described their interests and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told them how he had ins@@ ulated .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch whether he has ever raised the hand against them , and refused to stand out that his behaviour was also a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen the so long of Carlos , and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of missions had at least a certain fellow school .
Victoria Santos , which was not coming from Paraguay , fought for eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner they mis@@ ed them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of missions .
in the group , they can speak with others on their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case , everything began with mental action .
their we@@ al@@ thy partner succeeded it even to convince them that she was valuable .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as displays the authorities without a result and also by their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against its former partner who developed into an un@@ paved law between Paraguay and their home country where it mainly went for money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , man@@ age@@ ous implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
the display of missions is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the par@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Für@@ y ) on August 10 , 2016 .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ single Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and har@@ der as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
so the legisl@@ ature was altered in some points to win the MPs for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions may be prohibited in Paraguay , and to be punished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill had provided the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process that they have to bear the victims of violence at present , if they just want to receive an indication and secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not require sufficient financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay , mis@@ util@@ isation is seen as part of human relationships .
here you have to take place , that violence is no more than a bit .
who lies in view of these facts , makes himself guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will come .
we need to report so long display until it does not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ g@@ ressor to attack his victims once again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the string of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political power &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is considered a big retreat . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 8 May 2017 , the Federal Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and , with which the ministers issued a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the last closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at recent times the press freedom was injured .
for example , for example , the closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country , to stop its operation .
due to the closing time of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not ready to prepare a significant violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ conditional ;
2 . create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists may follow their work ;
3 . protect the Press Freedom in the Land and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman their right human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of contamination , including criminal off@@ ences , exercise programmes .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf Region and the ad@@ joining states to gather peace@@ fully , supports and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and abuse
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his understanding
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addressed one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continu@@ ance .
there are two reasons for the required medical research on site , there are two reasons : for a look at the global health system many medic@@ ations and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical demand on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and Malaria have a great problem in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa as elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by Phar@@ m@@ af@@ ir@@ men are a great problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , when producing their own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can be eligible for economic growth in continental Europe .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er is Director of the Center for research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epi@@ demic showed first gra@@ zing impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself expl@@ orer himself at the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed over the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ understanding of the media about these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ er speaks as private people ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ er RW : at the moment of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic National Program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al Therap@@ y ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion according to the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only have solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will remain the receiver instead of myself .
the solutions that we get , often can not be used in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or go back here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t had before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs plenty of money to have a continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import them from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is necessary to special scientific training , starting in every age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , expl@@ oring the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and increasing diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa opposite Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often are the limited speed , things to do , and the measured access to scientific expertise that click here .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited also the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producer the global food production change
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant which has been cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on work was given only by its own in@@ sist@@ ence and the question as many sal@@ at@@ ons he can set limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more sal@@ ads were patented and that it was not able to use them .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rotor or green leaves .
over the past few years , more such patents have been registered to more plants such as cer@@ eal or cart@@ ograph@@ ers . due to this trends the plant breeding , environmental protection and experts for nutrition security in the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still need let@@ tu@@ ce , it takes no longer because his work is still worth more restrictions .
&quot; it is , when I lie in a river a rock , around whom I must p@@ add@@ ling .
so we must now make it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents are going to go to Sal@@ ads .
and if it is standing before the court , no one can find out a new salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes so good as possible and tried to recover those features , which he wants .
however , however , it is very careful and hard to use no material that is protected as spiritu@@ ality .
he is also connected to a movement that will always be bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce of the sor@@ ting outlet in the &quot; greenh@@ ouses &quot; of the station and eaten . it is tested that plants can be cultivated in space .

it is not a co@@ incidence that this name is rather so sounds when the movement are from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software to insp@@ ire alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and gen@@ ic are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently used for plant breeding .
as part of the initiative , briefly Oss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eders could under@@ take that others can use them @-@ free seed @-@ free seeds .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ bre@@ eders allow only others to bre@@ aches their seed , and it is not immediate - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
whis@@ per@@ ed prospects
for the emer@@ ge professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility to bre@@ athe new plants , both important for nutrition security and environmental protection .
seeds ow@@ e him a role in larger coh@@ esion such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or just little to use seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , genet@@ ically modified , or not , from ecological agriculture , or not . &quot; to know our goal of ecological agriculture , such as it is offered on farms , such as farm markets , should also know that the way is bred , as such vegetables is bred , threatened .
nutrition sover@@ eign without seed accum@@ ul@@ arity is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to make other their seed is still available to provide . thus , their approach is to be patented in contrast , seed and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i supports argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed , since the available gen@@ pool is always available on plant material , which is therefore always restricted , un@@ distur@@ ban@@ ces .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has engaged in their doctoral thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability . they found out that approximately one @-@ third of all cart@@ oning features are protected as spiritu@@ ality , which is either not usable for plant bre@@ eders either .
for other plants , there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by means that mass@@ aged plants as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ itor
plants are so far@@ med that they have targeted features - of such as their taste or their color improves up to such , due to them in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is increasing by more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , since the changed conditions are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ man Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four Gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture , the company set itself a conservation of genetic diversity .
however , it says the view that spiritu@@ ality is other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant varied innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that can follow , as soon as the patent has expired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often , these instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result .
such protection is in@@ hib@@ its so innovations , but promotes them to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the differently : 20 years to wait until a patent has never done no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have already lost the struggle .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have been a general good and it should remain still to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ely incenti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to facilitate farmers their work .
that &apos;s it that drives us , and it will be impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in all , Mort@@ on on the concept is to be pat@@ enting , plant characteristics : &quot; we are not creating the features really itself .
the plants form it even as bre@@ eders , we finally did no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Oss@@ i @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who bre@@ aches a sor@@ ting , also ch@@ ast@@ ened its own values in them .
who believes on industrial agriculture with large courts and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures may be needed for the cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides in its cultivation of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is right exactly . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to have ) patents , creating most smaller seed companies , even without any patents or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant maker Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden Sal@@ ads .
photo of Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by the Av@@ oid of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like that I have been producing my efforts to produce new products , stronger than businesses .
I need a new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors are able to sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent one man makes it very nice for 20 years . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; to be leading to the concept , however , quickly spread across the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which himself describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . for receiving the seed of traditional plants , the center with farmers , and helps them to bre@@ athe new varieties to fulfil the specific requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed well and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ ed at an &quot; Open Source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i &apos;s obligation to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to land , which cannot be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission explains that the conventi@@ onally cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent , the patents on conventi@@ onally cultivated plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend for use seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently distribut@@ ing a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official start .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit organization US@@ C Canada , and concentration Group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has been compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ good map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ens , and other - a report published . it represents the view that farmers have to come to seed and improve their seed policy to ensure a stable supply with food products .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed well for sustainable food systems - a connection to by the Lu@@ by Oss@@ i hopes that more people will see him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mostly cultivated , where and how a bit is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to clear the people that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt , as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network released a statement on Facebook , where it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the F@@ Network for Human Rights Information Stay in spite of this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution would still defend a voice as now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirms that all technical options have been de@@ pl@@ eted to overcome and do not follow these targets to overcome and do not return . we hope to meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities started more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and the Al Jaze@@ era network of Al Jaze@@ era .
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web sites to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i had one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , there is no access to the blog of the column and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for spreading and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , whom he established in order to handle the C@@ ens@@ ur@@ ation of the Egyptian government , itself the goal of a attack .
Blo@@ gger , which is home to the provider of Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , on the other hand , on the other hand , on the other side .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces as he reported on the student protests and recorded a video like the police of physical violence against two students .
his article turn mainly for politics and human rights conditions in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada turned to the pl@@ ain@@ ment through the government and refle@@ cting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to give me the feeling of a siege against me ; an arrest , a su@@ prem@@ ise murder , incident at national Security Council , re@@ charge blo@@ gs , as well as any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , although only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have blocked him , and that they may have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ le go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed on 24 May to 06 August 133 web pages . this was technical tests in the network of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by the direction of online and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , 12 June , we started how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such practice indicates the intention of government to block the government to block content and filters to the Egyptian users might have access .
the situation , in addition , the situation will be wor@@ sen@@ ed , that the Egyptian population has no legal basis behind the Egyptian population , which can proceed against this actions before the court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day for day report newspapers in Brazil with a whis@@ per@@ ing impact of Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and hom@@ eland of numerous postcards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis in the middle of the economic crisis and in a stabil@@ ized financial situation , the world &apos;s highest stand in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to access the United Nations .
reports like these are all times daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so released the detailed information on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual violence , etc . everything that happens in Rio &quot; in the section &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to close as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes in front of the grass .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Che@@ fre@@ d@@ ac@@ ter of the newspaper , that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure is :
extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war@@ ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war .
in the same video , a journalist announced that it is according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that will be controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article , the newspaper writes :
it is aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to understand atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of Mafia and their partners .
is the name &quot; War &quot; more than they used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira against it , the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion according to a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to attract responsibility at the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as an extra on the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ counter@@ part of public service .
to memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are false : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data .
none of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we watch the mor@@ atorium per state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , writes it .
extra is the company Glob@@ o , the largest media companies South America , emphas@@ ises how Cec@@ í@@ lia emphas@@ ises the security policy of the state since years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia ( fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , is one of the state of the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a Fav@@ ela and inv@@ iting a unit permanently .
at the beginning , this actually led to a decline of for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP was to protect over gravel and repression against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the ne@@ ug@@ ging police unit , increasingly among f@@ uss .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux , from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - Crit@@ eria for the name &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of fung@@ us because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fought for three years , this project , and pressed his relief , that it will now win more and more . &quot;

the initiative is instructed to generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced greenhouse gas are used to supply the generators with the necessary power .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; production of &quot; production from the regions of the fung@@ us , &quot; before they over@@ test their quality , whether they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the fung@@ al breeding of various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and anything .
these Sunday they did eat it somewhere : there are d@@ utz@@ est reports of open roads which were surrounded by fire .

during a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began the Taliban .
two years earlier , a fe@@ ar@@ ful civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , which had defeated the short @-@ lived per @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at this time , A@@ ven@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i in Central Afghan istan for the last time with dinner together .
even if his mother did not say then , she knew that she would not see her son very long , - maybe even more .
in the morning of the morning the boy should go up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just murdered by Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly .
the Taliban known for their hat@@ red on Haz@@ ara well came closer .
many Haz@@ ara fors@@ ook the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape took A@@ shar@@ af in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a coh@@ ab@@ ru@@ be . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then , he took up what was left out of his low pay , and went into Iran . again he was once again in a foreign country with other refugees and towing bags with mort@@ ars , the heavier than he himself to earn his living .
at that time , like today , life Afghan refugees was influenced by mis@@ sil@@ es and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , remin@@ ded in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we hanged nylon from the open window , that we do not play at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe .
at the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea , he suffered ship and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ gro@@ af hom@@ eless , ran only by the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church who distributed twice a day of food .
it is true that Italy is a kind of chance for past asylum seek@@ ers , but it &apos;s true that the conditions to find asylum seek@@ ers in the country .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a recording center if you have officially put an application for asylum - what can still go for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers .
until then , people who have no money for a accomodation , either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there was A@@ gro@@ af .
but his in@@ discri@@ min@@ ate life of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to release soon from these conditions .
after having made several work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af had his entire saving in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so well that he opened a second hostel after a while , and a snap@@ shot was opened .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now theme of the documentation &quot; handic@@ apped Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
much bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in the past few years , some of Afghanistan run companies , including dress@@ ings , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the cell@@ ars and the kitchen staff mostly refugees from different parts of the world are .
the menu of the restaurant tells about the different Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek meals a history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome also Afghanistan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ aged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; targets are far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industries and the retail and aim to return to the country , which he had to leave for teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ gro@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and must receive the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has also plans to learn plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , which can sell people and preserv@@ atives . &quot; so they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he .
development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but at the end stand stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he would also want to help others in Afghanistan .
