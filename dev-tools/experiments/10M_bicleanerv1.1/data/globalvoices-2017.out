although I visited the USA at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is exceedingly great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have read about American music , American authors and his sport .
in fact , this country had a pro@@ found pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly used for a American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible repor@@ ter that covered with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student , the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to attract his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was it if it is the absolute truth , forget all the other things that I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had further strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you &apos;re always to be who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very weak love cover written about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the x@@ en@@ ity and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is to me as he is surrounded by its Eng@@ ines .
he never stops with his opinion behind the mountain , as one says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he considers , like a former colleague , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Latin@@ os , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ er and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and approved in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won by the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number formed by the Party nominated .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ s person , I asked me ?
I was able to bring out Tr@@ ump and his voters with people in harmony which I had learned during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , people from around the world began to talk a deep breath of man , with whom I had talking about Islam and its past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps did not illustr@@ ate the world with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; agreed .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to look at the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is also in contrast to the greater movement that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr who strug@@ gled with Sandy B@@ ahr and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son .
it even fits them to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who always helped me with patience and suffering from my colleagues , to get the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , who has helped me much in my career .
these people and those who shortened my love deep@@ ened my love in America .
during Tr@@ ump in his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part in its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the strug@@ gles with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they were either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were ready to see these things , my heart broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is unknown to draw the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as root .
people to arrange people said one of my friends , is exactly what has led to us in this situation .
this is su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and do .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about h@@ ec@@ tic changes will not be taken into account .
could it be that those elec@@ tors have voted for tr@@ ump because they wish to re@@ bel control over a country that they dis@@ ap@@ points ?
in other words , they would perhaps say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick who read the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with regard to those who look differently than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m. ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ jection of white toward all other eth@@ nic@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; ; voc@@ abul@@ ary from white in play on the White and Bel@@ pl@@ ash , which means the great Van Jones called exactly what happened to America so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you might have always like , America is really welcome .
for this country selected as his pre@@ sidents , twice the son of a Ken@@ nel whose history , as he himself says , no@@ where else in the world would be possible .
but with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with versat@@ ility , religious freedom and the entire term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rest , they say .
at all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the choice .
at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word @-@ change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the multitude answered with a loud voice &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; have Muslims in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; bro@@ ader the crowd .
&quot; did Latin@@ os place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a space in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were pure .
&quot; if any man , who doesn &apos;t like you , is a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an impressive and loud @-@ strong &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God be than@@ ksgiving , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was re@@ plen@@ ished .
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , the message said .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find no more space in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ische Stadt Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby Colom@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : an opportunity for children and adults of existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found their musical instruments with their musical instruments .
a school school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in Oaxaca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its Drugs abuse and Ban@@ den violence .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots , who started a musical project and offered the youth as a rare hop@@ per .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as Oaxaca N@@ VI believes :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they go through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion .
they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from W@@ aste
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village situated at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital - on instruments which are made from re @-@ evaluation waste material :
music with recovered instruments which consist of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling was started under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez .
the instruments im@@ itate cov@@ et@@ ches , viola , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , which were all made from waste .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez rec@@ alls a local schol@@ ar and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning of time :
first , it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them are not living together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : one from waste produced violin .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recovered material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation of &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance on :
the world generates approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - as humans in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spect@@ acle from gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work successfully managed to fight illegal fishing companies
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illeg@@ ally f@@ isheries are fought .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the Eastern African countries were accordingly exhau@@ sted and slightly inclined , a law cr@@ ush@@ ers are welcome to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ambi@@ que , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to kill one of its har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply denied everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminds us Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the ken@@ ian fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship in a stone time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out from the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t possible to catch the fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pill@@ aging of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the nu@@ cle@@ us of this initiative , which crosses the criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had sold out the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that inter@@ min@@ ded and work together . they can exchange information and stand on each other side where it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ ges Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally illegal F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to print . thus , the illegal fishing is a main cause of the regions of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate abuse of existing laws , which should be protected by certain hab@@ itats and types , the illegal fishing industry damage can harm a delicate balance .
however , during the actions against illegal f@@ isheries once caused by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , these actions are competing in real @-@ time with the information between individual countries , and these actions are in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there you can exchange the individual countries for such a lists of existing licenses , news to susp@@ ect activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port spec@@ tion .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive , when they move on the open sea , by satellite data .
this enables the authorities to describe ships to fish that fishing in forbidden areas - such as such that a ship invites you to catch his caught fish on other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing boats can be found on the basis of this information , the assum@@ ption of such ships can be refused to sell their load . and that they could not be forced to sell their cargo , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , in order to achieve significant losses for the owners , meaning that the illegal fishing catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to reach , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing companies in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win over $ 20 million in lost sales to win the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to the illegal fisher@@ man that enters into Eastern African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish farms , leading to the region &apos;s commercial fisher@@ man from all over the world . under these also , illegal fishermen .
their practices include actions like the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , speci@@ fying imag@@ inations , fish protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you ut@@ ili@@ ze the missing international cooperation and do the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ consistent control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship could not be illegal and a country could say &apos; You &apos;re not able to run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ alized Schl@@ up@@ flew F@@ ISH @-@ i tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
until now the connected front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships .
it has been revealed criminal networks , who had f@@ ake f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships , which used several dec@@ eit@@ ful ident@@ ities , and has found wing@@ ed ships and found it .
thanks to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight of crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing companies across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us fairly far into the networks of organiz@@ ational crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , suspected ships of precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be developed further , helps to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , where they can no longer be operated by satellite .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to help criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence influence on the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown by means of the position each of the tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gather to the neigh@@ bors who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get a better picture of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and merge their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ ges Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on a global system pursu@@ ing ships of ships .
there is signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities did not only feel crime nov@@ els , but also sh@@ out .
ships , who had to be f@@ ished without licence in former license and hardly with consequences we know that they will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fishing sales since then to buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 found the insp@@ ectors there on board towing network , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries consider this success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa van@@ ish several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six countries gathered together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . the aim is to tackle the illegal fishing industry , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia was able to report his first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under false flag . and not only the ship was used without licence , which is now prohibited .
the ship was also kept in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take @-@ rules of Gre@@ ko 1 set the strong signs to go against illegal fishing catch , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is a further success of many . and also the evidence that such a such special , collab@@ orative work to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world of the world .

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which makes the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans everyday life through a acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the office of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance to a basic change ; ultimately , however , the post@@ ure of a new election is blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government government in their latest article :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate of the world is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine . the referendum for many as the only way to conquer the land to conquer its institutional structures and to join a new government alliance .

on Twitter frequent pictures , talking about strug@@ gles , as well as reports of op@@ pression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed forces of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to susp@@ end police forces , including this woman in the State State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira bear no coats because a little bit could see what many national@@ ities don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic of the round , which forms the extent of op@@ pression per day :
so the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had taken the validity of the claim according to a legislative procedure - this was proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba .
as an adult man , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes examined were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano has not sought his life .
starting at the brush , same name as his father wear the brutal Mil@@ anese per@@ per@@ ations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he held the family of family for 34 years .
in the situation I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years you are not noticed that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ks and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of State terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services 141 in the La Per@@ la prison .

this is not the history of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed because of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the magnitude of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced in his own father in the course of the years .
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child , and as this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take Me to the military base , I often walked with us into the sports hall . there I had a boy with a boy , the mar@@ tial sport .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a poor hole , you have rounded off you with one of the ERP .
pass only , that they may not lead you a day , and I will save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolutionary ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the gym . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father loved me .
on the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoner .
these were all possible documents : university degree , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda amat@@ eurs , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ da , the det@@ ain@@ ees are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to climb . he led me to a bar@@ ge , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small in a blan@@ ket wind@@ shield and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were made and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open room and said :

I sp@@ un in , and saw a song that were tor@@ tured on humans .
she looked like a bunk bed and metal fe@@ athers .
later I found out that it was attached to the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just fast@@ ened there .
they cast a man with hand basin to the bed , over@@ g@@ ging him with water and pursued it a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ it@@ alia .

the rock there was horri@@ ble ... as a dirty win@@ k .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and was clear that the smell of a body is in trouble .
I never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible to do a man to another so much trouble ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; I knew that these people were killed .
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the cap@@ tives were fast@@ ened with hands and fast@@ eners .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also indicted in the process ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked people with the face down@@ wards - all were fast@@ ened at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance they remained silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father knew that I saw a prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed there a man and killed .
( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of civil servants Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera trial , students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina was charged to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , leading the former Fol@@ ding chambers .
the way , which you come in here is also the way where we arrived here .
if you look at the map you see that they took about this way and tor@@ tured for the first time .
here , their names were changed and they were assigned to be assigned a number of the trial .
when they survived the torture of torture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ phr@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all sor@@ ts of stolen things with home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear that the yield was a Baj@@ on@@ ett , or perhaps military badges that one has fought an enemy that one has fought .

but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... go , then this is no war , but V@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer of G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you , which you find cars on the street ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried with :
when you go so far , then I will find you and hanged yourself .
here we need any other one !
so my father was .
I have no one good memory in him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I had a jacket and a roller swe@@ ater of wool . both my father had from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he brought clothing with home .
then , at that time , the defence accused me to have been with this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay down what they wanted .
I was anyway to say so , to speak .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the glue is the last ab@@ h@@ or act .
now , where I am older I think myself .
I have children . if you only have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one developed further , and recogni@@ zes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you did exc@@ essi@@ vely during the dictatorship of people , but what did the course disappear ?
why children do children ?
one day , my father brought a girl with her mother whose mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that a little girl was .
I always set the question again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply have to put them into prison .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why to disappear their bodies ?
did these people not have to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the glue is the last ab@@ h@@ or act , which one can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were cr@@ ushed and somewhere , no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but some of course remains always .
&apos; I have seen how you were killed people ! &apos;
only about it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought to show my father , was created during a talk when he stood under house arrest .
I made him the alleg@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities which I had to do with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had compassion on me and asked me , why the whole displac@@ ed Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly had def@@ icient , actually good .
then I cried :
how can you say anything to me ?
I have seen how you were killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to take part in a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did exactly this .
I &apos;m getting the first ad in 2010 .
I finally knew that he was a bur@@ gl@@ ar .
no one can cause me that I am vo@@ des@@ ingen@@ ious . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .

an translation errors makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , in which one can extend his leadership .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers were opened to a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driver &apos;s license , in the last month &apos;s witnesses of an especially disp@@ oss@@ ated translation .
on a sign the Japanese word ( ko@@ rei@@ fen@@ sh@@ a ) , the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , but perhaps even with b@@ agu@@ ed back@@ ing &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; terrible drive . &quot;
the wrong translation was available on electronic ads in the input range and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided in the social media .
the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os , fallen . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n newspaper , written in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to English translation ?
this proves that no man has read the translation .
this is a compensation for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply in@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
the def@@ ective English translation was initially removed . the label &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible driver &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gramm@@ atical does not replace the label &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Police of the Pre@@ fecture of Kyoto claims for the translation errors . furthermore , it stated that the error was already in the text that they had been tested by the trans@@ lat@@ ors and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before they were published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry that older people feel insul@@ ted through the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast news set a detailed report with the phenomenon of the &quot; awesome &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; became an un@@ reasonable description of elderly drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but absolutely reason to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005 , which equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the senior citizens declared 1.8@@ 03 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in order to increase their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of citizens caused inci@@ dents in the same period increased in the same period .
the nam@@ e@@ ors not mentioned repor@@ ter published in the version of the article comments on the light which show the advantages of some Japanese seem@@ ing against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo concerning the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible driver &quot; ) does not mean the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so bad is the translation actually not ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that a real translation error is . &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread in all Asia .
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true mine of this bizar@@ re bug in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are diverse .
to translate , you need two important abilities : passive language skills to understand and active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of mother &apos;s language . generally , the convic@@ tion that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language language - native language .
for example , a French mother tongue should translate from English to French - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as the native language that might have translations into English . this may seem to lack of understanding , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English speakers , which can learn Japanese .
some companies , which have no foreign workers , have their own foreign employees . then , the Japanese company , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best . - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and v@@ ented propositions which are produced by machine translation shows that this technology can &apos;t replace other human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages .
some of the strange English for@@ ums in Japan , including also the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , which often use T @-@ shirts or pockets are used only for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry nor un@@ acceptable or at least be harm@@ less . but by major companies or from the government who have funds to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the City of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and ornam@@ ental measures in Internet and Television
main page of the port as &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PR@@ EN@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday , 7th of April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users announced that they have no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that Internet updates by V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV can no longer be accessible .
other online stations were also arranged on the recordings of the protests in Caracas , organised by op@@ positi@@ onal groups that Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s Government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is chew@@ ed , and receiving the Us@@ ern , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan Provider are closed again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been accepted since 2014 during the coverage of protests . at that time the Commission threatened for t@@ elecommun@@ ication with fin@@ es and closure , when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; calling for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
aston@@ ishing that that is still favorable to buy two liters of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ c@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is not accessible by a re@@ jection of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the Internet &apos;s National Assembly .
earlier post@@ ing research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , results that local Internet providers may sometimes use DNS . this is a technique to answer the DNS server of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS server , the server is def@@ ective or denied the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ Sper@@ re : @ el@@ ong@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ per@@ ed canal , the transmission on Thursday , April 6th , was discontinued when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera was El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who was recorded live in prison in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was defeated while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government was regulated as well that the government is regulated to access the access to multi media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay a lot of girls to become a slave to get an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip as an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for many years .
today Tina is fought for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimony to other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report from Kur@@ d , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ aster cows , attack@@ ing schools , &quot; ) published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they were not living together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies in the university , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on her . &quot; she is as a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who has become something has become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a large family with little money over their min@@ age son or her min@@ der@@ son daughter to another , abundant family . in the thous@@ ch the child will receive food , an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip , and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned here is that the children must pay for countless days of house@@ work which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse , and all that cannot be raised within the framework of a contract which cannot be raised .
in Paraguay , this is widespread in Paraguay with the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - above all young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimony , calculated and prolonged .
she tried to call things in name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated in Cri@@ me , is guaranteed .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double t@@ opping , explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is one of the family that their daughter in faith , that they will improve their apprenti@@ ces@@ hip , improve their position in society and &quot; something made of &quot; a different family . &quot;
on the other hand , the family , which takes up the girl with itself , and whose exploitation is justified with the belief that they would give someone a chance that would not have any training , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will get out many years later .
sometimes they never experienced it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households in January 2016 , is a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , their body showed traces of severe sl@@ ings . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military nationals , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer in the inhabitants of the population .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira dropped on Mar@@ ín as long as it suffered a dead@@ ly injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later , the media reported on the incident .
they found that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela accounted for deep in the par@@ agu@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and demanded that there were &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; accused Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier , un@@ punished the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married state and almost 60 civil society organisations requested a rapid investigation of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl .
if the case comes before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
the cri@@ ad@@ itas shall not only be explo@@ red as working forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers , who had worked in her father , had to register and lost her father her father .
their brothers had to go all work and started to sell money on the road or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
so they had to divide the time so that you still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fridays , they cleansed the fridge , p@@ ush@@ es the living room , polished the furniture and the infected ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they were done with learning , the more leisure had it .
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , they never had to hunger , but got not unlimited food . &quot; I was able to get more books from the library of the house@@ master as a food from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ izers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989 .
in addition to some evenings in the land@@ lord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , besides him and head of opposition from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept her indeed for intelligent , but kept not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house had found someone who list@@ ened to him while he spoke about politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn bad things there , &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would talk to the native language of Guar@@ ani .
their Lord feared the formation that they had enabled to lose it again , she explains them .
but it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid by them with their hard work .
also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was dis@@ crimin@@ ated . &quot; a thing about which almost never spoken is are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to school when they go to school .
because the other children parents have their parents , they acknow@@ ledge that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not return home at home . I had no free circle at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friends arise , I feel particularly obvious that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

Bill writes Egyptian users to social media to register in the government
picture by Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by global Vo@@ ices .
posted in Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently approved a bill to &quot; the regulations regarding use and commercial social networks . &quot;
when it is assumed by Parliament , users and social media have to register in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is commissioned to use civil servants and citizens to share social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law , users have to register with their correct name and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it will be missed that this could bring a penalty of up to six months or a fine of money .
the bill that consists of six paragraph and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs over the internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video equipment and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is assumed , as Egyptian authorities should not allow users to register the users who are not able to register for the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul saddle , parliamentary committee , and promot@@ er of the Legislative Decree , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and user received a password to come by the fire@@ wall through the fire@@ wall .
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to them it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far to exist such plans .
expert experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical concerning the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the demonstration .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist , &quot; the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strong in the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they were for@@ ci@@ ble in physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I accept them , then it means that they may apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizen or not . and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and to bring it to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature &apos;s legisl@@ ature and the constitutional committee before it comes into the plenary session .
whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military monument in the Parliament , in which the sens@@ es will maxim@@ izes and ensured that no separate Nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of .
last year , the Parliament ordered Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y a Legislative Decree against Cy@@ ber @-@ Cri@@ me , who had a life imprisonment for those who are guilty to threat@@ ening the &quot; public order &quot; and to protest the &quot; public order . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the nor@@ theastern Iraq area work the animal protective H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the intellectual workers of Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which is surrounded by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are given by Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and freight of their hab@@ itat , and because they always find less prey , end@@ anger@@ ed .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian is the only remainder of the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and the th@@ ri@@ ves of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on it that a big rob@@ ber is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in the wild bo@@ wel actually is small and goes to zero . when the team in the video shows that she had a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out pure joy .
as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in R@@ aza is passionate about another side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict .
it has been involved in wild animals since six years and particip@@ ates in wild animals .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group , and assumes that protective zones for wild animals are set up in the Kurdistan Region .

in early March 2017 , the liberal daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o , proposed for the North Japan &apos;s competent daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o , which were affected by the &quot; triple cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 , had an enormous earthquake , an ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Zeitung is based in Sen@@ dai , the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neigh@@ bor c@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had totally van@@ ished from the map .
even in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had experienced a nuclear accident , so that about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o shows from a local point of view which were reached after six years in order to re@@ build the life of local population .
the full report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of Japanese re@@ build authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
the residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( allowed , ordered , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s biggest success could be seen among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light on Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
even though , six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated the evacu@@ ation of accommodation shel@@ ters ( committed , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were settled into final spare parts .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation .
in December 2016 , there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in not@@ ation , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in emergency shel@@ ters . more than 75 percent of evacu@@ ated people were displac@@ ed after the des@@ aster , were moved to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 per cent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , did not open their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , killed in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land in people .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its land areas , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that only a sequence of nuclear power is , because only 690 hectares of land destroyed from Fu@@ kus@@ hima in the &quot; nuclear weapon of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered all the way back again but also remains un@@ defeated in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima move only 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their hab@@ itation .
is the indigenous population being prepared to the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous evidence under the native population and evacu@@ ated by the evacu@@ ated population . she asked them about the stand of the re@@ building and even as their indig@@ nation has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in their introduction of the article , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o resulted in a survey in order to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in the experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local population has taken refuge in order to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astroph@@ es prevention was done .
as it stands for those who evacu@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to be evacu@@ ated
in their edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Zeitung has increased their attention to the position of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience just the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima had also been a witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic , nuclear war , the Japan ever had to experience .
almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ fecture were moved out of 160 000 evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
at the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in permanent replacement parts .
after the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their hom@@ eland pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astroph@@ ic areas , most of the evacu@@ ated people still fail to get known as well , because the efforts for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to be competing with massive construction projects . this involves construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in Tokyo by 2020 .

however , after a while they often det@@ ects that more than it seems to be at first sight .
these global links are important because they require our advantages to expand our perspectives and recall that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal threads , which often earn less attention than they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly associated with someone over voice and country borders .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years was delivered into the intensive care unit : last Friday it had a police officer during a demonstration at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march towards savings .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
physi@@ cians res@@ ume him this Saturday and put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered crit@@ ically .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that rapidly spread rapidly within a few days .
on the pictures it is also recogni@@ z@@ able to recognize the vision of police officers who identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police was known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the completion of the investigation by the active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would be a police officer by demonstr@@ ators and on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen six months long in television and the whole op@@ pression would be justified thereby .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , recorded video on the net where you see how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officers and several sanitary briefly .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also immersed in the social networks .
in the bottom , clip shows the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50 . second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , has now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to keep his family at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in the memory of Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political power : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was murdered by his father , because he was attacked a military police in Secon@@ dary School . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who has been defeated by a police raid on his face .
police super@@ g@@ ents
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to demonstr@@ ators by demonstr@@ ators on the last Friday .
polic@@ emen trained at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
member Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police on violence against demonstr@@ ators against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street protests turned off , by taking the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists ste@@ aks : a window disc .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass windows to design with a photo of their title pages .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a fire on fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this is necessary to recogn@@ ise if you stri@@ ve out against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives a ab@@ sur@@ d , un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent actions of the military police are viol@@ ated by head@@ lines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lost villages in Cuba from the de@@ du@@ ous villages
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories moved to Cuba for the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a ) .
the Volks@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in span@@ ish sugar mill - known that there is no significant sugar content in the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities were manufactured in the sugar cane mills .
after obtain@@ ing the sugar cane industry in the region quiet , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent himself .
some sort the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ utes daily to factories which still grinding .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , who stands every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry cannot get his sleep .
he heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar cane mills , who have been in operation after long intact time , because they were preserved .
that was something that he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich will receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resi@@ sts the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the poor government decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production of 1.6 million tonnes of sugar was produced , less than the 1910 produced amount .
the news would have been a motive for the country some decades a motive for the country , but the bad har@@ v@@ ests have been no re@@ jection anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the village saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need : the 155 sugar tubes factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive , they were unbe@@ atable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories requiring annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plants and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
between 2017 and 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Land@@ scape Prosp@@ ects &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural Organization and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production level has reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current day will come with security in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sug@@ ars factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
it happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repeated most often , &quot; fr@@ aud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first shooting year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially adopted by these documents , which would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the address at and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ an Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could not have any withdrawal .
from there the responsibility was transferred and the letters came to more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ up factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still operational sugar cane mills .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another complex , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the stand@@ ings of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with each part which he removed , he removed his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace was deleted .
in many cases , no alternatives for work stations and services , which were generated by plants in the municipalities were created , in which they were created .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ alog@@ y speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present persons looked , when he guaranteed for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted high by weight grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the Gregorian community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich discovered that many things change , but not always to better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory closed , or better , when they started , they ab@@ h@@ ate them , they list@@ ened to the asphalt road , this is advant@@ age@@ ous and other firms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were spare to spare parts .
without the future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not used for the supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant will continue to be impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
nin@@ ety @-@ forty years old soldiers bring a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is no re@@ trac@@ tive person , yet he gives the lies that they told him not .
they have been pe@@ eling it for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is missing , but because he is bit@@ ing .

first Nations yo@@ ungst@@ ers use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express and maintain their own culture
recording a song of &quot; home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ass@@ y Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are busy with topics that are important for them . they are doing hip hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour since 2014 workshop leader mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the Ped@@ agog@@ ues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ ams and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group of The North@@ stars together .
the workshop therefore represents that the young participation in the convers@@ ations topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable , &quot; or whatever is to be found in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ z@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Y@@ oo in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ mu@@ cos@@ e First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate as important the receipt of traditional customs and customs of war despite the influences by glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in Indian languages , although the young people do not always have to rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the ch@@ orus will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the young people gathered some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly by the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who lie@@ ve them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in the address , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like that none of me are interested in me .
but I try to go on the earth my days
this is the day that you will take to our carp@@ enter
because we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will raise us a day
I would not see how to live a bad life
so they can grow and meet our youth .

in Japan you can see almost any restaurant plastic dishes .
in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( bund@@ led , &quot; Plastic Models of dishes &quot; ) is served by any food that will be served in this restaurant .
customers look at this plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the C@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there is a variety of these small enterprises that produce those plastic dishes created by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they don &apos;t want to make them more to everyone . however , a new trend will change it today in con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ omes published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ itation .
now in special sale : new mobile phone bands , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ es collecting objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ate , mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence is increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case , an imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile support .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we also have this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is a apple that keeps your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight to the com@@ ic .
some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon roe uses , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can &apos;t forget my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic meals can also assume a less appet@@ ite form to surprise other colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile support has the shape of melted ice .
in addition there is also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , Ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .

in reports in@@ - and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug tra@@ ff@@ icking in Mexico , the mis@@ chief and killed regularly only in statistics . these reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself .
the coverage on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident is hardly anyone looking for the mour@@ ning or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every loan , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , who are many paying parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds may never heal .
therefore , the Mexican News Portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the Digital Project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug tra@@ ff@@ icking to life &quot; ) , who wants to give a voice and stories of people who were killed in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organis@@ ational crime cannot be afraid of our lives .
the impact are a lot of pro@@ found .
for example , when shops exclu@@ de , because they are threatened by drug tra@@ ders and therefore all the churches must travel many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as fear of life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who sear@@ ches every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father &apos;s four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her neph@@ ew .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves back to the task that we have made us to go and to the graves after the people who we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay them out because they demand a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central alm@@ ex@@ iko .
your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence than normal , no matter , in which form it occurs :
I know the disease and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism now for some years now .
I come on daily newspaper ki@@ os@@ ken every day and see the title pages with pictures that can only be taken from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it takes me from the version .
sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only thing I am pressed or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be equal to or consider this as normal .
she continues to :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin remember that he is great . and it is not normal that people listen to the &quot; Lab@@ ours &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me , that , when would they lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear of them that something happened to them .
I see our weakness , if stories are to blo@@ b numbers in one statistics .
the el@@ ess@@ ness of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is justified that they were &quot; grown @-@ up . &quot;
I think they try to speak that they spar@@ ed from such a tragedy , if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of comp@@ ress@@ age in the main city . &quot; it describes how armed crime month was pl@@ under@@ ed , until it was not only destroyed the business by the end , but also their family torn apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never claims that trau@@ ma remains high , the fear of fear comes up again when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
each further we are removed from each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want to be arrested , because the others are arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill .
I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would resolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , for I forgot how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence called . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions to such as : who car@@ es about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was killed by the organized crime ?
how is it to increase in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexican ?
he is not like other young boys of his age , whose parents will take care of her .
Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells that he had to bring himself to himself as one eggs , potatoes , tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the k@@ itt@@ ens will live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ ask with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left B@@ one - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he had seen just a few blocks from his home , the bloody Lei@@ che of his father , who was shot by armed men from a fore@@ igner car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence through the organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder according to the government Council for public security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ ds per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of thousands , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of always new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who we don &apos;t forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal pol@@ í@@ tico &quot; has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to set complex information behind the failed fight against drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , which has shown the country over the past four decades , in under@@ stand@@ able way .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he left , contain pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in one moment , in which it is going to raise a rum@@ or or a f@@ ake to escape .
but how is the years that something is di@@ pped for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or un@@ true , tend to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago .
since its first publication , it has been used ir@@ re@@ ous to consider trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupler from picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - deny that there are plenty of careful reporting regarding events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it pos@@ es questions about our desire for pictures to News .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war in Africa , Africa &apos;s second largest country was neg@@ le@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of impact holes that were difficult to drive .
tragedy fell to the tank wagon .
the government representatives described a fire ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as close to people who was full of people who illustr@@ ate the World Cup .
houses are br@@ ushed and stolen bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture of the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur user Myst@@ ical Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple pictures of the pre@@ text form the grey scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of stolen bodies , which are rounded up on the ground for persons .
but here is the story not to end .
over the years , the same photo was f@@ ished by several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but real but not that in connection with regard to trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the un@@ le@@ gen@@ ic villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ enz@@ eu@@ es reported dra@@ stically by atro@@ cities which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a population on Human Rights Watch .
many were z@@ qu@@ ed , shot or burned .
only from satellite images the follow @-@ time could be illustrated .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bagh@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image from the DR Congo appeared again , as evidence for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mal@@ ign@@ ant use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false descriptions ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was brought to a cover for massage red@@ ness .
another step further bring personal comments , like this example , the image from the DR DRC uses sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the image of S@@ ange has also been in connection with the dead@@ ly persec@@ utions of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to an error , published by the United Nations , those who were trying to flee ra@@ kes , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s reported that these descriptions were assembled with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di@@ di Arab News page , which in 2012 claimed Mr. My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ ein His said , Mon@@ ks and polit@@ ician gave himself to the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ ein His testimony , but did not allow the image from the DR Congo in relation to this statement .
worldwide coverage of false information
traces of these false c@@ rat@@ chet ten@@ sions range from 2011 to 2012 and will actually come from anywhere in all over the world .
with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how much information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an converted picture search with the search@@ engine of Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the owner of the DR Congo .
they origin@@ ate from a mixture of private parties , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some of some false reports are for@@ warded , some other attempts to escape the counter@@ f@@ ences .
we received examples of the ab@@ dic@@ ate use and brought them in connection with the respective countries , based on what page they were released . thus , we want to display the range clearly than by language alone .
several examples have been associated with each other ( which were associated with each other ) can be used in some cases ( some examples in some cases ) .
here some cases that can now be stopped now ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of incorrect copy of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ ang@@ ed countries refer to pages or server , about the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ con messages are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , which are available according to met@@ ad@@ ata and information , which are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a Th@@ reads &quot; war of the Buddh@@ ist against Muslims . &quot;

even within Nigeria the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of mal@@ ign@@ ant use of the picture from the DR Congo , on the other hand , the sympath@@ y opposite the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand of a blo@@ g@@ gers , which are tra@@ iled to del@@ ig@@ ated , since the photos of it was ab@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar published a judge that they were as &quot; deliber@@ ate news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding in Myanmar . &quot;
these judges who have been published exclusively in English also includes references to counter@@ f@@ ake pictures of rum@@ ors that kill H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and spread out of extreme groups to kill the Muslims of Buddh@@ ist and elsewhere ( which is often used by bur@@ m@@ ese national@@ ists ) .

this post , which gave himself to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x congregation , puts it clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT prove Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein took part in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and its publication is still included in the picture .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 over students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic close to An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture was not taken by the red@@ ness , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ st attack . &quot;
than the picture later in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that it would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ thin &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo is provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and released a discussion under Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and on the stop on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to reach their communities of this events that took place mut@@ ually in the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams , a major attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ath@@ ed as a cover for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with them were taken in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of the media reports compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message was allegedly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acres , in circulation , there were discussions for@@ ums such as this here on Vietnamese and declared it to fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the embassy that was contained in the image from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os was found .
there are further confirmed examples of a incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , inks are also no longer tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data agreements with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ wler and ver@@ ts them via image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only after the original accident of 2010 , the picture finally carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two powerful themes or frames ( penetration ) that crosses this post . the first frame focus on religion .
the photo was used in terms of major discussions about silence in relation to the murder of Christians by Muslims , or to the defence of Muslims - ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is rated as comparison with a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it &apos;s worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is however , what happens if readers can not give this images to no longer faith .
with social media , there are only human beings who un@@ inten@@ tionally un@@ intended to tr@@ ise the water around a tragedy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sug@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sug@@ ars and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tast@@ es the actual tomb of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
the argument is that the holding of images of a ref@@ usal comes to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures will even be asked by the victims .
at the same time , the concern that for@@ ci@@ ble images and viewers des@@ per@@ ize the ability to stamp emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , seeking to work as violent media on it , others to help ) .
while there is some time to discuss for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the news media , fact that they are indisp@@ ens@@ able for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting this because with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will thoroughly solve the situation in which a picture was somewhat sug@@ ared , but actually replaced by the context or to completely mis@@ use species .
any investigation , however , should also be considered to be considered internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ super@@ v@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ oured to provide language enthusi@@ astic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi ) and others , which are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish sauce farm ) .
but all resist stub@@ ble every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient to understand why a full explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand what a word is meant .
these unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists of Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the sale of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as follows :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h to give you your parents in recognition of what you have been working for yourself in your younger years .
and words present in the H@@ uns@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - Com@@ pati@@ bility or F@@ aul@@ ty , which one feels , after that it is violent in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they de@@ loops other cultures , ro@@ aring other thoughts and we@@ bs our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes , as we have the world to analyze and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , we want to publish more this &quot; invisible &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive in these small languages are .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ er@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst fire disaster of the decade
the island nation Sri Lanka looks at the moment of the worst flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by Mon@@ sun , who normally starts in late May , are caused by strong rain accidents the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the shore .
after a statement by Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of men were killed , because of the floods and sl@@ ud@@ ge win@@ nings .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 certain dwelling sites .
the rain@@ falls were gradually returned on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water@@ ways in some areas went back slowly .
health and hygiene rules of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos are an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water walls of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka are providing regular updates to the flood situation .

the Women &apos;s March on 21st of January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
the use of Per@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love gir@@ l@@ friend .
I trust her my four years old daughter , she entrusted me their children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we are calling for the rights of women .
in the next , we charge rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain screens and people , some keep the i@@ kon@@ ian image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from a American flag , other sc@@ an@@ dic par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend looks at me , says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these conversation .
people , with whom I have been working or people who have known me since years - the Sah@@ ar , who know it - from the far more widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built in their performance .
they were mus@@ cl@@ oning me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims globally .
we don &apos;t see all of them .
we practic@@ ed our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different art . but somehow we all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims who do not fit there , de@@ formation .
dis@@ mis@@ ed mus@@ cl@@ ed
I am not ste@@ ady alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come in a sense when you think about it ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western idea the religion was deleted from Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ etion makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another insi@@ sts in the reduc@@ tive images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ized Western books for centuries .
this soft image language is determined by the dark man whom you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the history behind this pictures in the 1970s .
but these images continues to rise today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood them still continue .
I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , def@@ ective Nar@@ rative domin@@ ate our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ allow the reality that led to their countries in the last three decades of nine Muslim women , while the USA could not be able to select their first female presidential election in 2016 .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v fail to recognize that when French , Muslim women are forced to carry out their head@@ scarf and forced Saudi Arabian , Muslim women to cover their entire body to cover the two sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercise his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this Strong Nar@@ rati@@ fication weak@@ ened Muslim women to lead the movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken by Afri@@ cans on the American floor of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who had been killed with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective pre@@ ference force deep and def@@ ective , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children are estimated to become a tim@@ es@@ li@@ stic attacks and cont@@ ik@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell them and because of the kind , in which we tell them , is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we are doing more than just stories , based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative who help us to understand the world .
and my industry is phenom@@ enal to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we are talking about where seven million Muslims make the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ins@@ ulated Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jew@@ ellery design in 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ ir@@ zer were made by the Muslim , American St@@ atics from Bangladesh , named Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan was re @-@ thought the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were untreated Muslims and Americans .
but am I now ignor@@ ant Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
sometimes if people ask me why I don &apos;t tell a por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes to get out or my hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ or@@ an , who bear all Muslims in themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ p@@ W@@ utz . &quot;
I kid@@ ding , we wear not all hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ or@@ ane with us .
we have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ oured to fight far beyond Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islamic machinery and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is already a Muslim figure that is a Muslim ; or of which Islam is manipul@@ ated .
due to the stories we tell them and because of the kind , in which we can tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in more than just a fore@@ igner who gre@@ et a woman &apos;s head .
or as the terrible card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .
screenshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in his h@@ ug@@ n@@ most forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it takes up our identity , which is so far , versatile and versatile , that it may be impossible to fit into a drawer .
the author was founded in 1986 on a photo of their children &apos;s garden group .
use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Muslim was born only in my prec@@ urs@@ ing force , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
if social scientist of religious life describe it back on the following terms : believ@@ ing , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior are perhaps not visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend of my neighbour would see my rock in the fire that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a , if they could see through the 15 @-@ metre concrete and air that could separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ u@@ rous rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms and her Arabic verses to protect the coral and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat each of them three times .
I pray that they may be protected from evil , the evil man that can see and do the evil man that cannot see .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is possibly not visible , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins a Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with their sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother &apos;s mother is the picture of my grand@@ mother by her sisters ; as she won a competition in the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi for decades ago .
it &apos;s the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings of the old Su@@ fi heal@@ er ; and a cor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which can virtually wi@@ el@@ able .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to say the prayers that she had said to me , if I have a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be in it , as she hath brought me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God is , my only Lord .
for a people who was founded in over centuries - through a &quot; empire &quot; colonial gen@@ ius , a company founded a company with the name of British East ini@@ quities @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call my only Lord .
the author was founded in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging to the growing and listen to hear that men should not weep , but at the same time , my father wept .
intermediate in , while he writes books on the modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , she wept N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ surrounded by his family in India , who lived in a half century not in his arms .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart from colonial families who have dealt with the Muslim world as at the game risk .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries of Europeans all have Colom@@ bian to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first flying legend of the history was rejected by a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an in@@ ev@@ ous , cold sub@@ ordination of British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion , deep in our unforgettable trees are back ; our un@@ inserted history .
it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with forces that went over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , were in Iraq to pursue mass destruction that were not existed .
it means that over half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
an American mus@@ cl@@ a means to know that the self @-@ moral of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means that if a tragedy is home to the US and the susp@@ icious name carries a Muslim name , the story of four times is reported as a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist name called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was sent and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I bet when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and we will count black life .
an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a mus@@ cul@@ a and a journalist , signi@@ fies the in@@ tough@@ est inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of our with multiple d@@ ash @-@ looking ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion is more possibilities than a wi@@ z@@ ard cube , but is represented in the reduced branches &quot; against them . &quot;
a mother means to give me about my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that ma@@ cht@@ full and privileged people on this branch @-@ structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia er@@ ect .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ sters which began with President Bush and in President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is located in the immig@@ ration , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in action .
it consists of a country which includes its borders across people from just across the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a wrong and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab and Muslims in the vis@@ or .
they are the wars which we carry and the bombs we cast to Muslim countries .
due to the stories we tell us and because of them that we do not tell us , we are here today .
in a study with the Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University of participants showed a scientific picture and bes@@ ought them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we must lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to reveal the Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades to recogn@@ ise the roots of our fears and the def@@ ective and dangerous expres@@ sions that we store in our news editorial actions .
at least there is an increasing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , which tries to capture our multiply with d@@ ash @-@ looking ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ mer ; the vir@@ al video series Secret Li@@ ves , a initiative , multiply Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , Muslim , Muslim , American super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initi@@ ates which show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of Muslim American life .
coll@@ age of author .
but I &apos;m interested in this difficult global time point where we are located .
and that moment has consequences that go out over the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the internet is now to lead the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally since they did Muslims in &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has been exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown by making the &quot; other &quot; created .
a few years ago it had not yet been given them ; now they have great territories in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m careful about the re@@ alities and history that I was not aware of what I was old when I was my daughter , but who made me today about an unknown mus@@ lim@@ a .
things I left here like a baking stone track in my speech .
things that may wake up remin@@ ders , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that makes our humanity like a history , someone likes to listen to one another . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations are held in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
however , these are no terms where we are usually able to throw us in our schools or we read in our papers .

we all have to ask ourselves , why ?
why do I feel that here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are guided and people through the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades of science was conducted by Stan@@ ford .
we must show ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of his , deliber@@ ately and in@@ aware the &quot; other &quot; too hard ; as it is my gir@@ l@@ friend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because he had not bom@@ bed a new future , while it already capit@@ ulated countries and &quot; to others &quot; people were bom@@ bed , far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
monument number , of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to enter here and now despite a language barrier to someone with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , the founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported a brief initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog .
however , the focus is not written by T@@ LS on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of large cities and to destroy .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already been conducted since 2015 , the risk that small and not all small languages are not given to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we do cities , accept diversity - safe spaces , in which residents do not need to be attributed to .
while &quot; listening is often linked to understand &quot; understand these events instead &quot; the list@@ eners to appreciate , to feel good . &quot;
in this format , history counter will initially set their history in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants have no professional history counter , their commitment and its representation is that the audi@@ ences can be attached to it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the history of history of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou cons@@ ulate also take the opportunity to clari@@ fy for their land for the customs of customs .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the folding of the bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having declared the importance of his fo@@ al , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to talk to an audience , that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he divi@@ des his feeling of in@@ fos :
you have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities have taken place , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can organize with T@@ LS in contact to organize your own history of history .
Puerto Rico is calling for the public debt by the United States
with the aim of a new investigation of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took over 72 million US dollars , participated in a mass demonstration in the capital city of San Ju@@ dea , the capital building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Citi@@ zenship of the debt of the debt ) and the Church of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the debt of the debt has also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is its demand :
the people , Puerto R@@ os , calls for the politicians , banks and government authorities who are responsible for the debts of responsibility for their debts .
we require a financial assessment and a line committee without personal interests to the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ eration that is ag@@ ged in favor of the economy .
we will press and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os is ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not its .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be deduc@@ ted with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require immediate actions .
the island - not in the state alliance of the United States - suffer from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a reg@@ ression Non @-@ Profit Organization without Party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing government views .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside the measures will be taken without the participation and convic@@ tion of the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; danger of citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Follow @-@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian state , Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been active for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on the digital culture organized in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the German @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , bub@@ bles from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ corporation ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , published in the last year and is licensed free here , includes a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of the repression .
it is a homage to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to know how to build movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are connected to which this is connected .
activ@@ ist , artist , designer , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have been involved , to watch over the fog that gives our news@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet @-@ volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we have no information about his current state or dwelling place since then .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that would fall on his release , and they want to know it back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel is paying a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us will start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we now here ?
what have we decided ?
what did we do in this process of tempor@@ al extreme belie@@ fs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution which was transferred to an unknown village .
his wife , the writer and lawyer at N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Based on the command of a military court from his cell in A@@ dra had taken . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015 , who committed themselves as an in@@ scri@@ bed @-@ Assad government , and they set them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his dwelling place and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved on projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in the access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently transl@@ ating the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes are predicted as the work which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ point of numerous civil@@ is@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ful traditions and pers@@ onic influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS had all to put everything that is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world em@@ bodies .
this strip has created in the digital archae@@ ology and maintenance has created a time capsule , which will be open to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
tragedy this project could not yet close this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life to dream of freedom and bas@@ sel taught me to emb@@ race her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English when he was already in jail .
I have learned to read English well , to write and speak .
he always has his knowledge with everyone who has asked him . he has taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel is open to me the gate . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also brought other in@@ adher@@ ed , as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without having held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a Pro@@ visional Application , which she wrote in jail from 2012 to 2015 when he was in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for a year .
she tast@@ es the lyrics to him when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arab in English .
the book is licensed free .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens on every visit ,
that I will sing in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the occup@@ ations at the moment , in which we emb@@ race us ,
that any of the d@@ angers no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , bo@@ ilers and watch@@ men
I forget the prison of the prison
and I say in every detail of your voice and words
I carry my passion with my passion ,
if your eyes say goo@@ db@@ ye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and over your absence to weep and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...

Bass@@ els &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
according to the British Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights , Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has gone over 65@@ ,000 people according to the Syrian network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or arrested on violence through the regime were tor@@ tured or executed .
since 2011 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been on the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
now we repeat our claim in hope we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption , respon@@ ding to liability again on previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ ence re@@ acted by wrath on a corruption , who returned a government member after half of his sentence to the workplace in the State apparatus , in which the corruption was committed .
this is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other accused due to un@@ faith@@ less@@ ness of 54 million Met@@ ik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds in the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que whose Council was Chief of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of a good guided tour and immediately asked his re@@ vocation to the company , which took place on 19 April then .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney of the Republic which received the request , there was no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , returning to his old post , since the company did not finish a discipline process after his detention .
but many inhabitants of the action are not good .
the Centre for Public Integration ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , an local institution which establishes itself for public transparency , sentenced to the company &apos;s decision by the Deutsche Welle in an interview with the Deutsche Welle :
represents a return in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a return to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we have knowledge is that the company should have a discipline process against the immediate agreement .
however , the company was apparently , however , however , does not have a reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behaviour also and considers the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of them has eaten .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could consult and his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has prepared to become re@@ integrated into the company that he helped damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is to be paid for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ que and student of political sciences in Brazil says the director had no Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded from the state because he tried him , I can &apos;t believe someone who has rewarded someone to such a way that the state has already been dra@@ fted so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing to return to the state and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only himself served by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , when hand@@ ing it became a in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself became tired of this man that was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was awarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred it to remind the prime minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a thief belongs to the prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ que is not only for ever as the first independent President in Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce , but also as a sharp , em@@ itting and - prophesy in the way - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of its most famous oral represent@@ ations had confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being able to sell his own individual interest , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ah said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious human being de@@ crimin@@ ated at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also canc@@ eled :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free .
and today it sets the company , in which he was able to re@@ comp@@ ute money again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Main@@ tain steel ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bur@@ ar pa@@ e word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ an or don@@ keys .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their post@@ ure from the net because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although on the Origin of the Word still is discussed , it is usually used to report on people East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; In@@ struc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook announces the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or guaranteed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ sing let@@ tering ) as part of an initiative to tackle the far widespread problem of hate languages in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the A@@ scen@@ ic national movement has given the word to an extremely ab@@ dic@@ tive t@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra national@@ ists as Hass@@ talk against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight against them in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of sen@@ sible content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; today is normally associated with rac@@ ism in connection , but the Word does not call on automatically Hass@@ le .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people reported that Post@@ s , in which they have discussed the use of the word or doub@@ ts for his use of use , cen@@ sored .
in addition , there are several bur@@ sing words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same book sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , such as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age b@@ ays ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however he had asked his friends in the spiritual way , whether they knew how he had left his back pain by doing a voc@@ al .
the movement K@@ U la - &quot; healing &quot; ( K@@ U ) + the Fra@@ ct@@ ment ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that they decrease in English language of radical national@@ ists , but also stressed that Facebook will be analy@@ tic , before all the posters that are suspected in the sus@@ pic@@ ion of rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it automatically filters the word .
the automation will not understand what you are on fac@@ be@@ ook .
what to do instead , the post is carefully directed to analyse and control it by sending the words to the present words .
for example , Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( Chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spok@@ es ) .
the good is that these three thousand national@@ ists who hate them , a very good lesson .
now it is at the time to circumc@@ ise their national@@ ism .
while the action can send a strong signal to everyone who hate them , do not want to keep the efficiency of this strategy .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship will often start to use a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook started to qu@@ it his post when he wanted to leave his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I was looking attention to this new Directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my fac@@ ebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post has been removed from Facebook and told me the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; the Facebook Community standards did not escape . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Post@@ s from people , who have no negative inten@@ tions or simply trying to show their opinions against the Hass@@ le radio national@@ ists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed , who has nothing to do with hate languages :
post without Hass@@ elt from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme national@@ ism and religious fundament@@ alism are po@@ or@@ ly in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook in the start of the initiative would have to do more than the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a beneficial intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
such words to zen@@ ry is to kill even more hat@@ red within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that if they started this without local context or technical support , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inheritance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mist@@ akes , they tried not to report the acci@@ dentally deleted .
if they have only something more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would have a large turnover , would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has ensured a lot among users among users .
instead of serious , users have fun on Facebook , and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ le , to see if their Post@@ s will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook postcards that have no hate languages , but nevertheless removed :

in the last five years , extreme national@@ istic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alist alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence .
among other things , English language in social networks will heat the violence in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s were forced to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his convic@@ tion that I would speak with them to his bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but rather than just like the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better been running better in context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the children
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
it is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to offer a law that this practice is to offer , so that the married age is now 18 .
prior to this change in the event , there were several members of du@@ ist@@ ical and mus@@ li@@ stic religious gener@@ alization in practice , and in May 2016 the leader of the inter@@ religious organisation ( I@@ RO ) , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , was gathered that the state had not been involved , because that the state does not mix the maturity of the country .
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN @-@ Convention on Human Rights , which is the Min@@ ority Year when people under 18 years old . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 were married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , who were involved to abol@@ ish laws or children , followed on the foot and enjoyed great support . und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , it was not all smooth .
a Hin@@ du Guide , e.g. had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should be dam@@ ned again to worry about their own matters . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition could actually be part of ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and sometime there were doubt if the Opposition would agree to the bill of the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 transmitters ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which was discussed at the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country have to vote and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave a status update which has again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill to the children before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes against it and none .
after he was decided in the Senate , the draft can now be changed to the law .
the majority of the social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws had been changed to children before finally .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and un@@ necessary Ger@@ ede , that has closed the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s nearly worth every price .
while Abel was my opinion , it &apos;s definitely long enough to do the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas passed that the day was finally arrived :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that is quite open to them how important the passage of the law noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft resolution was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and of which 35 were present at the voting .
all members agreed to have approved the law for the law .
the children &apos;s arrival is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ bearing board .
many thanks to all activists who have brought him out .
congratulations .
a Th@@ ank you to our M@@ EP@@ s .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan , Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
six months ago , Mah@@ ar@@ aj announced his intention to do the judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , thought it would be quite right when Mah@@ ar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most of the social media users , the debate would be related to the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l defeated :
Dear Sat , if we , instead of discussion about the discussion so much , in a way that we may agree to the state that we may agree to the state that they may need to prevent our daughters that they may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ related men , who , would you be willing to bring together the discussion ?
or do you believe that it is not a problem ?
but whether there is a judicial approach against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children is legal or still the norm , although there is laws that they say .

with the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , reci@@ pro@@ us to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dar@@ kened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey has now lock the popular and on the C@@ row@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to help hel@@ mets and reliable information and share .
both students as well as repor@@ ter and fans of TV series are against the blocking .
although many techn@@ ician users are used to use changing tools for block websites ( a current article from New York Times reports that Turkey has not the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users are not listed in this category .
although Turkey has been un@@ locked articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regularly since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country of the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages , reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) are di@@ pped .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform all Turkish Wikipedia sites on which de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the domain name and thus makes a whole c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is available despite the legal ban .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set all of it to read snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . this is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed .
this can help users to view all Wikipedia content , even if you can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the spar@@ row .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ y@@ clo@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror page of Wikipedia , as well as Wik@@ i , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to be blocked by similar gu@@ ror@@ pages when in the respective country Wikipedia will be brought forth .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and collabor@@ ators with Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Bible po@@ d@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you ri@@ p@@ ens to another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
basically , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves when they are blocked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wild photographer uses his camera to make attention to the necessity of natural protection

S@@ ing Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were missing with bad@@ ly positioned moti@@ fs and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated him itself a camera to bear and try to feel the situation .
then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ing , Nep@@ als , Nept@@ as wildlife will bring to the international stage .
and its hom@@ eland right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that are attention to Nep@@ al@@ fa@@ una .
he described them on Facebook as it helps to help him in his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game photograph@@ ers ! !
I just rested at home than me suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ rah@@ a .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was found and I immediately started to kne@@ e pictures ! !
S@@ ing stri@@ ves a cooperation with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nep@@ als Natural and wants to understand the understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he ought to know it , for he stood already on face to face toward face :
a tiger can &apos;t be distur@@ b by the opinion of the sheep at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also I was in the way of the darkness at home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he is immediately going to see us and he st@@ ened me through the trees of the trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ing placed the &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos .
its passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als of Nep@@ als and Wild@@ animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to take part in the Bar@@ dia National Park photos of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took to take a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist information .
see below some of these photos .

according to the marriage , Indian women for the first time , to send out the name of their hus@@ bands

this entry was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
an revised version was again published as part of a Content @-@ Sh@@ aring Convention .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family .
instead , they use a pr@@ onom@@ ic or tell &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ om@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect them as well as the fear of the social pressure , and fear of the consequences for them to preserve this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ ur@@ a , sentenced by a head@@ court with her family and the village community after she had asked an appeal to her name .
the tradition did not call their wives again in the name , but also under men it is widespread . however , they have no less assign@@ ments to fear , if they should not come after this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ let in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including healthcare professionals , a unique club , and thus quickly became the main discussions issue of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they discuss the host@@ ages of the patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the Community &apos;s Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is engaged in the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era at the coverage of intern@@ ships , such as children &apos;s heating up to the ban of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs .
it reports about how this club was created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of the mur@@ al .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion group , acted by women who did not call their hus@@ bands at the name .
it was chosen for this issue because they wanted to open the talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
not to write the name of their hus@@ bands , there is a ro@@ man who is guilty to all , and never have any question .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t with@@ holds this is considered as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deep roots that we have never made us up to this discussion round .
at the beginning it wanted Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband until now , at home , at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussions round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was too late .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I should call him from now on his name .
with this self confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good cause , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , off@@ ended , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then she asked them , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell us the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want to respect it ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra through the breaking of a century ancient tradition , in which married women will never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole exercise just before the exercise ; another decided to leave the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family until they cursed him .
the expression on their faces was static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ r@@ ausch , with an ancient fires broken , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they had the women in the head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law her mother murdered them , she was afraid and said that there was an error .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini thought that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less prim@@ itive and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports , how women have tried to stop other practices , such as for example , the loss of interest in red points on the fore@@ head , who shows the sp@@ inal status :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the fasc@@ ination red point if he would do it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard that in order to bear him .
the other women did not have stopped completely , but my , they are now in a better position to choose it , at some days not to wear it on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets .
&quot; we make a trip at every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out on the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure that the women make sure what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced and sang on things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working for this problems for so many years and yet I have been working on some things , for example , how our ident@@ ities are linked to our hus@@ bands , even so hon@@ est .
it feels great to tell certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion lap , we have talking about the concept of honor and as it is connected to the clothes .
some women have been born in the group since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a tro@@ users , bear ; they did not tar@@ es .
after a lot of war and discussion about the advantages of your own clothing election , the Mor@@ al connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , decor@@ ating Roh@@ ini her own couple of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could bear them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to make it possible .
in the five months since its first discussion club has already been changed , Roh@@ ini has confirmed that things slowly come into the roles :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tast@@ ed a couple of time , but we left again to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women contribute now at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they would like to reach them in their lives - like the f@@ ooth@@ es to navigate more freedom of movement or your own clothing @-@ selection - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
to trust each other self @-@ confidence , it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman believes in the club home and other people , what we speak and what we do .
we are all sit in the same boat .

this led to us that the UN led a mission in the South African Land to investigate this practice .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made only recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published within a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of in@@ crimin@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized because of the liver cancer in the hospital .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state @-@ risk ) , having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China receives calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , who allow to allow him to make a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out on the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations Organization
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway fell into Sto@@ cks since the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government believes that this is nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to absorb the salmon to China , since the exports had been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the message had spread out that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to un@@ conditional release of expression and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his detention , he was not able to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution where China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow him to seek attention where he wants .
the top diplomatic mission of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called China to release Li@@ us , as they were in an explanation on 30 June :
we also expect that China raises all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife , as well as family members .
you should meet all the visits and they will be able to communicate with the outside world to communicate with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans said to him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad unless it was obliged to help him with his com@@ es@@ ity . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the News Agency AF@@ P on June 27 , that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities ref@@ res@@ h not only Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the re@@ jection of the US Embassy reached a desert response from China to themselves , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to join himself and in@@ discri@@ min@@ ate comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom like e.g. trav@@ ellers and access to medical care of his choice , which they have according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as the international obligations .
the US @-@ Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz are also introduced a decision in Congress to push back the Chinese government to push back Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditi@@ onally .
I challenge China to allow winning the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditional , that it can be found in a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reuters that China had great concerns , whether the work could be super@@ vised by Li@@ u in Hamburg .
Canada
on 28th June , Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called for an appropriate medical care to provide a reasonable medical care and to give it the opportunity to leave from his family .
Li@@ us attor@@ ney told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day but the police always monitored the room in the hospital , and that it is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us further :
in Canada , China calls for China to safegu@@ ard its international human rights obligations , including freedom of opinion , true and un@@ le@@ cted for the exercise of these rights .
France
in a statement on 29 June , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a declaration of humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o all treatments will receive , which he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family can be found in contact with him .
although the news of news has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there would not be any further information if France will eventually start him .
Taiwan
the Council of the land@@ lor@@ ries in Taiwan called for China on 27 June , and release a larger tolerance opposite to those who require peaceful funds to demand political re@@ forms and democratic development .
in Taiwan , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u , also called China to allow the sick of intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed very concerned in a declaration on 28 June by Li@@ u , and gave that many him asked him to pray for Li@@ us .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives had taken and had been committed to a harmon@@ ious , more stable and prosper@@ ity of their China , which again contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encour@@ ages , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stup@@ id , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people were critical to the only political party of Singapore , because they compared to Singapore with other countries .
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody said in question whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , whereby most people go an error .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; logic of logic , &quot; to defend the existing authorised exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , we hear that we are not a country .
it was so vul@@ gar , so did the certificate of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory viol@@ ating .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very Nobel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of his , he appeared un@@ mist@@ y .
in contrast , he has def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally to those cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian sei@@ z@@ ers appear to be found , leaving the turned logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the final week , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
related questions clo@@ cked with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clear his mind , since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so the country belongs to ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
I would be very than@@ k@@ ful if our wer@@ der K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point , unless it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the Blog on his comment , he tells about the critics that you should begin to understand the entire book of the conference , so that you could understand the context of statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore has a city and no country .
read the inscription .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; be considered a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even important , even if we are pleased to enjoy the free and just elections .
he sold Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party of decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t know it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows its dis@@ appointment on Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes a new generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said that ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that I expected - have I understood with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doub@@ ts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes that it is really associated and is aware of what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review put the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
has Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ger driver ?
if Singapore is no country , we will only be considered independent and sover@@ eign state ?
if not , on which country do the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is alike country and city .
because he plays an important role in the government &apos;s cabinet , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are the most serious significance .
why do you aff@@ ord your military service , but do not defend their own city ?
who must pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
that is the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the year , Singapore and always was a town :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have many more than expensive ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a town / island nation .
I can understand that we often list@@ ened to &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true .
we were rather talking about the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most miss@@ ile aspect of your residence or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the report on certain parts of the world discovered and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest install@@ ment of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is set to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on which situation the conversation is held , it is considered to be pol@@ ite , interest in his inter@@ governmental partners by asking personal questions .
anyway , the default answer is then the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ ans may cook inside before W@@ ut , if they are kept for Americans , but me not distur@@ b that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ ons make a Canadian flag clearly visible on her back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Canadian .
however , Americans are ... .
so it was even when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian have always borne small hor@@ hor@@ n@@ als on their baggage to distingu@@ ish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gender equality are legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are apparently very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposed to be regarded as the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we are nice .
I hate this .
I have many American friends , which I ad@@ mi@@ red very ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would be nothing , if one would change me by Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called &quot; nice , &quot; it is basically to be sp@@ aw@@ ful - like the proud , gentle , gentle , but tragic figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( who has her own Canadian Double gän@@ ger ) .
when Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing that you encounter .
harm@@ less , is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and interesting to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around one .
I would even say so far , to say that the wish to be free and alone , a main concern of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
what can be del@@ ight@@ ful as &quot; nice , &quot; maybe just cool courtesy .
they often don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we l@@ acks warm warm , open kindness , which I now connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) I pray Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au the stage to show that Canadian had more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada a great sexy .

the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon steel tanks of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , sh@@ ast@@ eries , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area together .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the biggest part of Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people still lived there , just a few hundred people in these cl@@ ergy .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the district was 16,000 people , after they had hardly gone over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story residential blocks from the early &apos; 60s , who are called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ k@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic for the decline and destruction of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to stop this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why do I speak ?
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , served all of the community .
now there are only paved road with deep@@ est spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and contributed to their contribution to the central planning business of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the spirit of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , can be seen in the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls who are seven years old , look at the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera , they immediately draw back .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us that we can photograph to photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed somewhat to her friend and suddenly leave the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for own needs ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping , and vegetable construction .
it &apos;s hard to come about the laps .
the county management delivers free candles in winter for free candles and bread .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build the zu@@ cchini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ amm@@ as , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to receive no financial assistance from her daughter and wait that she supports their young grand@@ chil@@ ds instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pen@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells you that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do so - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her history , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for a@@ unt G@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could build the zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build the zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one can get to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as inter@@ mission in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a few days .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remin@@ is@@ cent of the th@@ inks before the war .
in spite of the relatives found in Central rus@@ sia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ bot Asia simply left away ) they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative building in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but this will last something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child &apos;s money for every child .
her husband lives in the spro@@ uts .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten was found once , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ äh@@ ne and h@@ ens .
it told that it was initially a very severe situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but during the time they lost their fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of the dark street , or the few people .
one can get to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , however , it has more to do with pill@@ age .
after the war there was hardly work and all lived just as it was right .
I remember , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation is approaching the end , a little boy is over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy from him .
he plays with the ball , which then falls the hill .
a group of children follow the ball now .
while they run , some of them cast stones into the hidden building .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for un@@ certainty in their lives .
they do not know different .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants are home to their long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican female , a small woman with a Coral pink Brill@@ en@@ frame and gold colored ear@@ r@@ ingen in t@@ ed@@ dy @-@ shape .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this top name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it is ) has become a destination for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the passage .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with grinding , folding walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for Hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an immig@@ rants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is telling the people in full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast to call : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard .
she would like to re@@ ject it .
they also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medic@@ ations that they don &apos;t have to pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the one of the long voyage .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived before a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable first name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ inder ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family returned from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her since African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , hopes to get to Boston to get there their husband and three children .
they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States , normal for the first stop in South America and then go to the north .
the family had belonged to other way@@ men of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans &apos;re already speaking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his way@@ leaders , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building worker at building sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bust@@ ick@@ et to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om Africa is our mother and we never let go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests should send their often text messages when they have continued to gre@@ et them or report about the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pulsion of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought together to prepare h@@ uts like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , S@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family moved to migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that Bust@@ ick@@ ets are sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , 25 people are , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking center outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declared that he knows what the guests can do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and help others . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid at his office .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before men who wanted to spend money from him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for a accommodation and a unknown , one all@@ otted , has offered it to her roof .
some months later the family lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the House of Mama Africa is all full of guests .
in the courses please consult their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but it is nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she bl@@ amed them in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ s that you have made a customer , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and old .
she laugh@@ s sad , while they are careful with me .
&quot; Habla Ya &quot; is repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their mobile phones an monitoring app .
check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users allowed .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the Ur@@ um@@ qi was given a mobile phone in which it features the regional government to install a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the message it is said that the app &quot; must notify Access to terrorist information . &quot;
but k@@ ett@@ led the authorities also use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h was arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture because they had installed after they had installed the app , with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the announcement of the police , the app has to determine the sources and the distribution of the terror@@ ists and follow , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , of online sc@@ am , Tro@@ users and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they are online , and to control the own home network .
this App with the filters for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in a diverse way .
for example , the remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to steal .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications over digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the eastern and South , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme ornam@@ entation and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely wireless Internet circuits .
based on Twitter @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from File China &quot; ( bund@@ led news in China ) , photos from a Check@@ point , showed photos from a Check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen un@@ checked the residents if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile Noti@@ fication demanded that people are installing the app within 10 days .
if you come to an Check@@ point with a device without this software , it may be imprisoned until 10 days .
this is a return for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended to use for older people .
this is a form of captivity through rest @-@ out technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; China &quot; ( guaranteed publ@@ ishers bre@@ aches ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ leb@@ ars .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal contents .
all government agencies , authorities and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published an ordinance on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to enter their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obvious to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; but this promotion does not viol@@ ate the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possibilities , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane was called his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar that you are quite a place where everything has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved itself and revealed a truth that is clear from both inside and outside .
one , which makes its name all honor .
one that has to be found in a list of poultry and squ@@ ee@@ zing it , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ers .
but when you come back to reality - beyond the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters into being of meat and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt solve in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence even when the earth is on the axis of the un@@ healing . you will clear that you are being caught between the walls of the walls , which are built here between the walls and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they have been arrested and arrested three times , but this was not yet sufficient to bear &quot; my lesson &quot; how the chief of security it formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he introduced his power over us , as he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five teenagers were torn down during a peaceful protests like dar@@ k@@ raut from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was sufficient to cut the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schrei@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the quarters were cov@@ eted , not my own .
for the first time it was still , Reg@@ ular , at the wrong time , even when I found no high demands on a city that is to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their complic@@ es .
in the third night the things had a bit cal@@ mer after the power supply in the quarter heard .
I broke the silence when I cried several times &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; by my house roof .
I heard my voice due to silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were cour@@ age@@ ous enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends included me ; we banned us a gorgeous picture that filled my expectations and fulfilled all .
in such a moment you will be aware that you have free the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the Military Safety Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can return your voice , after you gave them all the way up to the office of security in the body .
I joined there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear what you are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ ash was set up in me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and don &apos;t know what to look to me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my foolishness , vanity ; perhaps at the Revolution .
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I had not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never heard you to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that such fatal consequences for me could have , and yet I do not have a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sole discre@@ et and his father equally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father equally with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this curse is up to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic acts of torture , which I was exposed to months .
I penet@@ rated the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
after that , by the court and the second office , which leads through a ais@@ le to the individual cells .
I prepar@@ es all details exactly one before I work the room .
unlike otherwise , it was probably assigned to me a larger cell .
I have to share them with only one another prisoner , and immediately put me immediately , without having to wait for their permission .
after some minutes they felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I put on an old @-@ tested communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cell fin was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long excav@@ ator he ultimately responded to me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , a respected man of mean age that looks like me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no distinctive fac@@ t@@ issues can be seen , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers linked to its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had insurance to me , they would be happy if I abide .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ h@@ or to drive all these c@@ rows that lab@@ eled to the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I hear them still &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at least 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the colour of the po@@ ison is , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the tomb in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; play on 13 Sur@@ a of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; you are here to listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret revealed : to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent terrorism , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ty dial@@ ect - thus they played their conservative estimate of their world view .
that is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse to turn it into a hero to transform the crimin@@ als in a hero .
I cared for the audi@@ ences and meet in Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cked man ; at least he is doing so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ vers@@ ation , despite the visual expres@@ sions that began to escape from him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my kids , you are still young , you can join this day@@ time with your life , to protest when they will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not say .
I used it to answer it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say more exactly when Bel@@ ei@@ d@@ yes and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication agent .
when and how that happened , was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to be cont@@ am@@ per@@ ed for me or evil , even though I had done nothing to make this punishment .
to penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to pl@@ uck me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably dates from the clo@@ cks .
your Hen@@ ker suff@@ ers to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with it , and you can &apos;t keep your terr@@ ors .
my cri@@ es were not enough , so why they captured the pipe by a cable .
at my first conclusion , I asked if the investig@@ ator had been working as a gar@@ bage dump or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables attached to each other to present great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them were changed , while I was still in the series .
I had lost all my body in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped to cry out .
the hen knew the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , so it is the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the dew disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty to this night .
it must be as far as midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ ch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I am answering the voice of an exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; my lord , my father must make a terrible wor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet , and keep you , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speaks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + Community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text , recorded .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brings the most of its time inside ; he kill it to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
what if you can rely on , there is a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ ot@@ ine lips to discover her lips .
he lives in the top of his family house , which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where she lived as a rocky ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist , who was transferred to the conservative majority and ask their old opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression by art and Rap@@ e .
with his music that often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of the entire Arab world . all of these issues are not only found in its hom@@ etown Am@@ man relev@@ ance , but also in cities that meet from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is looking forward to someone who is not restricted by borders , and he can feel with people with people who have suffered among the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it is not open , he gains a special decline against the US @-@ American policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , some thing associated with his identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry has been born , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , while he put into two cups of nest @-@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise until sunset .
in addition , the Jord@@ anian law states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ tim@@ ely called Jun@@ it@@ ag is little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the loops are lu@@ k@@ ew@@ ed coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan like a prison under the sky above , above all , when you cast a look into the neighbouring countries .
from therefore it avo@@ ids easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to lan@@ der it in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry Jord@@ i has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a band , already for the second time .
some parliamentary members who support the Islamic Figh@@ ting Front - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ti@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , argu@@ ed the cultural and traditional standards of the country , and the main reason for the concert tab@@ s .
the members of the Islamic coalition of Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert is cancelled due to sexual orientation of the prison .
many claim also , the engagement of the band in affairs like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which in@@ quire the alt@@ itudes of author@@ itarian reg@@ imes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a rep@@ lied the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply s@@ wis@@ ely rh@@ et@@ or@@ k , but indeed an increasingly clear reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in the application of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender nor@@ ms to body by taking his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have ab@@ dic@@ ated sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
in Jordan over the past few years , the number of Hon@@ orary moral &apos; has increased - the in@@ official outside was dropped .
human Rights Watch according to its cli@@ max . in 2016 , the number of Hon@@ ey@@ moon reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 . however , Jordan was still afraid that Jordan made the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to support mur@@ ders or domestic violence .
according to a law to decline in 1954 , women who are exposed to risk @-@ famili@@ al violence , &quot; for un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a year @-@ long bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman will happen to happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music is very popular with great popularity and is well known to rep@@ lic@@ as long as tab@@ oo that are in its country long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b pointed out that his work is polit@@ ically , but dre@@ amed that he can separate his music , the full explic@@ it concerns on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I wanted me a policy , &quot; says he .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question after the Palestinian identity in an attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is again on poverty .
the list of the songs , which are polit@@ ically polit@@ ically , can be carried away .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse can be repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the other course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind market where you can get in his words , &quot; it may be &quot; faith or non @-@ faith , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ e@@ or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan over the rights of pregnant women and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still have been cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b launched an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to notice later that his comments were torn out of the context , and his opinion was cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but only one worked version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance compared to homosexu@@ als is not subject to Islam .
in Abu Nu@@ ovo , he mentioned a po@@ ets of the eighth century , which still has remained in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ What , who should once again work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , was open to homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled , to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive vote will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news services ordered several former government officials and members of the teacher , with the reas@@ oning , related to the problems related to social media to impos@@ e problems with the deep in the country .
in view of what is the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs show , only the top of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian .
for him , progress is a permanent and take @-@ . Jordan has w@@ ai@@ ded a performance for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks much slow , bed@@ itor and in@@ ev@@ ing changes . it is sure that this changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arab@@ s , even from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he only dreams about it , his work till Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region will be att@@ aching to the help of music , art and literature of real and basic off@@ ences - and not by bombs , stream@@ lined and artificial art . at least , he hopes it .
until it is time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to be ra@@ pping and therefore will also aff@@ ord resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that there is a version of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . a further theory states that the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years were taken away from the West Japan into the northeast of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ball@@ ast in the kne@@ e .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b a couple of great places , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition of W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have long been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en since long time : two land@@ lor@@ ries are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival will make the only true landmark - and to spend a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were external apparition and body care as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitim@@ ate profession as the Fr@@ ise@@ dec .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us main port , is located on the Pacific coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ kers and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel sure .
at the same time , Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , appearance , and therefore also the unusual hair@@ style of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , has led to that , and more than normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ style your be@@ have to form them .
the exceptional demand for hair@@ style , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ style your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition , which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts of each other to show them who can interpre@@ t the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here a chance to convince their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad coun@@ sels an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip in the hair@@ style art , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and the bi@@ ds options have seen dozens of young people , that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school was offered special training workshops before the school year in March , and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the community and the district , where@@ of we are very proud because of the children we have built this education community .
Colombia : love Letters to Gu@@ er@@ illi@@ er

use with kind permission .
the following article is the redesigned version of the message &quot; Liebes@@ messages to Gu@@ er@@ illi@@ c@@ aster , &quot; which has published the International Online Magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this post is published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to humans that we know ?
is it not too much more important , people who feel out to bring their aff@@ ection ?
just this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to Re@@ conc@@ iliation ) , the young people ex@@ h@@ ort to write Gu@@ err@@ illa &apos;s letters .
only recently , their land was a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ a@@ movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International applied for the signing of the peace agreement as an important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its services .
however , in front of the colum@@ bi@@ ans , there is a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ fare who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock , they must now have their weapons to life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which led to life in constant an@@ gu@@ ish and in some cases a deep hat@@ red against gu@@ err@@ illa has to record it in their ranks , and support them with a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young column can close together and help the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ers to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ fare , which then shall be committed personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to Re@@ conc@@ iliation , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we love the man that we love to write thousands of love letters , but those who forgot to need them much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plan , he told him to share his love with people who needed the most ur@@ gent ad@@ versary in this year .
thus the plan was created , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC which now have to place their place in society . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
up to now , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos; I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the town council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art re@@ ist into the camp to translate the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC exhibited so on how they had done it earlier to meet the commands of their leader .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of under@@ lying people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all parties . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that da@@ w@@ between , &quot; telling the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ ors of Valle del Cau@@ ca Province , described this unforgettable experience :
after we had handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa war@@ ri@@ or .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of cottage in which the gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ fare living ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ fare who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ egran@@ ates , a dead@@ ly weapon in the village of Dor@@ n@@ ought .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never ever in my life , someone has something so beautiful , so I am going to answer . I suddenly run the tears over the che@@ eks .
I emb@@ ell@@ ished him completely , and set me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be a fight , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mist@@ akes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know that there is a society there , who is waiting for us with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now I have learned about how I have to deal with weapons .
but now where peace is re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion lap .
the students were grown up as a war , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret places .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process . now , where we have the opportunity to develop us to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this size , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people were to hear , who had never been found so far and didn &apos;t know that people who often have seen as a monster , and even experienced people who were surrounded by their hab@@ itats and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the land lives , does me hurt .
but it comfort me that all men - also those who killed and so much damage have caused us to bring us a smile and a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have answered on the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the example of Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the column was made , that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
as long as long ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to lift up the weapons and to protest for their rights . and that &apos;s also entirely justified ( ... ) .
we use the F@@ ARC now on peace , to a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology belong to them - about all those who dream by a country in war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution and sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . den@@ ds among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ated .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a great bandwidth of d@@ angers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ pressing .
with terr@@ ors we experienced the coverage of the last months about the persecution of persecution men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is based on the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q church , is not only on the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ y , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is currently in the Republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports were published , tor@@ turing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ atic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities that ass@@ ump@@ ed que@@ fied men and killed them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ ition , was born in Gro@@ z@@ y and grew up there .
already since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was growing , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why they moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ es from the gender equality of their landing , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
in fear of her life , she moved from the last En@@ des into the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunte@@ er hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day was told me that someone wanted to have my help .
it was a def@@ endant from Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ ition which burned in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her to help her , he would have a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere in the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he spar@@ ked them no more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , photos of my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I am attacked .
when I just returned to pick a few shopping cart from the back seat of my car , I heard a male dec@@ im@@ me : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt anything in my body , but I did not hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to honor the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ wo@@ ke the last en@@ ary in the hospital .
apparently , some women had to get everything and started to cry out .
the man fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two rec@@ ess in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which case there were you laid - in whom the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name , but the doctor stood and put me on women .
I am grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim name , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that it is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they called upon me , wrote me , strange , some completely un@@ known .
that was the beginning of an alp@@ habet .
my family was attended by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the required to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie .
they asked ab@@ sur@@ d claims : some told me that I had to prove it up without the roads ; others wanted I have changed the official television in Gro@@ z@@ y , and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Photoshop .
I have Kör@@ ber size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how has your family re@@ tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people once said to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not just your family , but the entire republic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she placed a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately , the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dar@@ kened window discs and a number plate with a 95 slide .
after it happened for the third time , it was clear that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ checks the number@@ ing of the number@@ ing - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I will say that I remember them all , they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief .
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it , without record , without notice , without anything .
I cut my old SIM card and cast them into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
he came and checked at the hotel .
the number was registered for a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you have left the country ?
our people know , in which hotel you can feel . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about sex , but it is a tobacco issue .
some traditionally k@@ Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements do I bear in me .
so very much I wish that this se@@ el@@ ian barrier can &apos;t be overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
if we cover with camera , I can really trouble me how the person reminds one of their past - thus to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed away ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington in last week .
for the time I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who made one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan it was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he completed a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
that &apos;s me , they probably invite their relatives to take care of the person concerned with the concerned person and at the end , proof that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; has experienced by blood .
OC Media : are now even pregnant women kept in this secret conditions ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says , there wouldn &apos;t be very many .
if , then , those who have no rich relatives have been dropped or those of their relatives have been dropped by the Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they will be arrested there , so that they can present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they have attacked some of your village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not just disappeared , but have been di@@ pped specifically to radic@@ alize them .
OC Media : is this now just a delay or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I have just arrived someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their bending had grown .
there were nothing new of them since then .
they simply have taken them .
and this so called Lord , this person was taken with themselves when these people were taken .
however , they were not yet presented as a band , but there were no reports yet . we guess that such promotions are quite possible .
why else should I not allow it to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and det@@ ects of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation belong already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always contributed my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already familiar to Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to lead us originally to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civil@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but eventually cast us back into the stone period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had coloured lashes , wearing tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria was never bo@@ iled to me only one hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people hit me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a spe@@ ech@@ less : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ un not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it often says to children , if they are funny about sick .
OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes ahead of you because they believed you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never have been off@@ ended , never ch@@ ased and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this grant talk time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al .
he spoke not about us by se , but above the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how people began in the city to change themselves .
those who had so@@ jour@@ ned and laugh@@ ed , looked upon you again with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the period I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily slow@@ ed .
OC Media : what job do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I earn not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA are not much .
apart from that , I still have been active as activ@@ ist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , mer@@ ging , I kept them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I have no cent for this .
I discovered these people , when I had a flu@@ ffy piece of refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : apply a Hid@@ sh@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ oud .
so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens which wants to make with foam in front of the mouth that there is no oscill@@ ating with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Cab@@ ard@@ iner who have Russians also ; on all the planet it is , but it &apos;s not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am from there , so it is very pleasant to hear what to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I meet here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - pract@@ ising Muslims who go into the mosque and during Ram@@ adan are living together with men .
do you know , many think at tran@@ sid@@ ental ity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex , to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ ce .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and do not kill me for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I know that I myself am now myself .
local groups warning in front of an increase of suicide in the armed Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering under an un@@ usually high unemployment - and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase of self @-@ moral .
the photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on the 27th of August , the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered under Ang@@ st@@ alls , depression , and he cons@@ ented for his own help , the ability to work for his family , Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human beings , who are working in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anonymous .
one on YouTube made video held the moments after he had kindled himself .
some people made it fast to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists from the site that even more men could take the life .
the An@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanged .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family v@@ ets that caused by the persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ able to feed their families and safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a majority of Iran survi@@ ving the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to contest their hab@@ itat by the local Arab population .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in all Iran .
in the An@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s upcoming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most significant and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and discover@@ ings .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ ians systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a multitude of dam@@ s , built the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are re@@ located .
this dem@@ ons have led to the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and local agriculture as well as the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ yo@@ ungst@@ ers now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co@@ operating , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ is , who completed a job , completed elementary school , 55 % a further secondary school ended and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activists in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of self @-@ moral among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become more worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ ra@@ z new to the upcoming ethnic people and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process process :
as officials and institutions , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will exp@@ ire the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s , to destroy their hab@@ itat out of their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their advantages and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names will not be toler@@ ated , speaking for the speaking of Arab language or the carrier of arab@@ ic clothing .
in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to wear the human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation explo@@ si@@ ves .
it remains to wait , whether the world will rise up and being aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to the expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , there are many women - especially white women who draw themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fr@@ ust .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even have well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money in spite of the same education than men .
there are women still under strict observation when they are going to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epi@@ demic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women earlier , or later in various areas of life to a smooth blan@@ ket , and that discrimination is still rising through the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware of me and known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer to suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I have to speak on skin colour , on black c@@ is women , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q church or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mentioned , what kind of body , se@@ el@@ ian and verb@@ al have been used to keep both white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but they all agree that women - all women should come together to sing &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexual violence there is a institutions to sexually mature form r@@ assi@@ stically motiv@@ ated violence that we are exposed to black women in two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ations and men of country earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often should be referred to as white girl as a white girl because of obvious integration problems .
or that women in black don@@ ors and women have been subjected to a higher risk of risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the other hand , I want all the women , all men and all the people always have any skin colour the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join me as a black woman who refused to take into account the ini@@ quities of their thinking , which relate to the gender as well on the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and won &apos;t be more about my affili@@ ation in a white femin@@ ist oriented sphere , who still strug@@ gling me and countless other black women and ever rejected .
so@@ unded in 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also I feed me to maintain a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is written in a historical perspective , a de@@ cent and mar@@ gin@@ alized beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ref@@ using to join me group@@ ings , who absorb our customs and customs of customs in order to push their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program .
I &apos;m not trying to submit white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to keep the meaning of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to revi@@ ve them .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women to different host@@ esses and from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I draw it before me to redeem me and completely from the femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife , instead of me for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is important than ever before we define black women to our own performances and give us into the don@@ keys that are created for us by us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves on this way we can also create spaces in which they are completely secure and even the spiritual , spiritual , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements that make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately will call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contra@@ di@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I existed in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can be bl@@ ossom in an environment in which my life neither survived , nor igno@@ red , nor denied .

Paraguay , women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The weeping Women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents their pain on the moral of land in the country and in the region to express their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ r@@ am ) which reports about women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons .
a police Commissioner , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , said that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had been working towards violence .
since the end of their relationship has passed over time and the police said , their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was shown for mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , even the in@@ accurate display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
a few days later , the second woman moved their ad .
to break the Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ies of violence against women , it is difficult .
if women have taken place at all , they get no support on the state in general .
in many cases , women also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who are mis@@ used . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence at all at all of the prosecution authorities .
In@@ hibit@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statist@@ ical Mis@@ sions and a legal system that nothing under@@ n@@ imm@@ ed 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation and statistics
it &apos;s hard to detect how many women really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gen@@ der@@ quire at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ lla , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that are not even an@@ sat@@ er@@ ise the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney At@@ tor@@ ney General 9@@ 600 displays due to domestic violence . 70 % of them went on violence against women .
86 % of ads arrived at the police station .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace dishes . 86 % of the ads come from women .
in advertis@@ ements , 40 % of women said that they were physically disabled , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , this statistics show no the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen female Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i will actually appear only a few of these off@@ ences . &quot; on every woman who are reim@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
for every woman who are reim@@ bur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , declared it at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay , the prosecution authorities can not be reas@@ onably documented , how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists were killed at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordination of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman died due to violent actions .

invisible mist@@ re@@ acts and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z had been the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to go , but there was nothing to regre@@ t it .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . however , she carried out the psych@@ ic violence in one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able :
I never thought that I would be a victim of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I have read about it , I thought that only women happens to under@@ score them , because they can be found of violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote comments on Facebook in which it described its aspects and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and telling them how he was isolated .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ish if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to have his behaviour also a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen as@@ much of Carlos , and left him not earlier .
it seemed almost so , when they wanted to say that victims of mist@@ re@@ acts had at least a certain co @-@ school .
Victoria Santos , which dates from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner she har@@ assed them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support against each other .
they do that which many others do not do : they take the statements of women .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as we started all with psychological abuse .
their we@@ al@@ thy partner finally succeeded to convince them that they were wor@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as ad with the authorities stayed without earnings and also from her relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against her former partners who developed into an unknown legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , mainly in which it went mainly to money , power and the influence of its former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good but not applied .
the indication of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment is a path full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the justice &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also looks great problems in the use of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ y ) on August 10 , 2016 .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks to explain the Fem@@ ale to an autonomous offen@@ ders and har@@ der like it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature was altered in some points to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , they feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions may be banned in Paraguay and must be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had to report the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) procedure to bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to pay and secure a safe accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective when the legisl@@ ature has no adequate financial means to provide :
in Paraguay abuse as part of human relationships is seen .
here , a change must take place , that violence is no longer regarded as a somewhat small .
whoever believes in this facts is guilty and bears witness that the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators are coming .
we need to make long display until mis@@ use is no longer considered normal .
however , on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed by the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , however , among other things , a passage has been cancelled , which had the partners in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning conc@@ iliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ g@@ ressor to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is true as a great return .

an independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper still exposed attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he was sentenced to one year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and placed in court but later returned later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after he had set his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of government .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the main minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and president of the Central Bank .

the authorities restri@@ cts peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights systematically , and activists , their views on the public matters of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing , and the insur@@ rection of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , until it was forbidden by authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , held a article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the justice &quot; which was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 in the judicial authorities and the mixture of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of having set judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure , to raise a verdict in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hands to Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 to the prison of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ qu@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he was banned his sentence .
the Court of Appeal also raised the decision of the information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court of Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper considers the newspapers after attacks by the om@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information Minister issued a statement , which was extended by the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and in which the Minister stood again against the decision of the Court of Appeal , to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the last time closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was injured in Oman at the youngest time .
in other injuries , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , to its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the destruction of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not ready to prepare a complete violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the European authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ conditional ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . among all circumstances ensure human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman has no justi@@ fication and without fear of des@@ iring measures , including criminal cases , ex@@ ert .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , Figure takes place with His understanding
medical research in Africa is very rare or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addressed one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of performing medical research , there are two reasons for a missing in the field of healthcare , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa far more serious consequences than elsewhere , and missing investment for expl@@ oring this disease through the phar@@ maceuticals are a large problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , is carried out in Africa at the establishment of own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is director of the Centre for the Expl@@ oration of Inf@@ ectious disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epi@@ demic showed the first gra@@ ding impact on the national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral studies at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself asked the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors RW : at the moment the focus of my work is based on research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about important current scientific topics in your country and in general ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we are only solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise , we will always remain the recipi@@ ent instead of myself .
the solutions that we get , are often well used in our environment and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it enough ?
how simple or difficult is to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or draw here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it lasts for months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa , which should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is aston@@ ishing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is demand for special scientific training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , expl@@ oring the space of health , health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and dynamic diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the estimated access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding since the 1980s in the USA .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant , cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on work had only been granted by his own influences and the question how many sal@@ at@@ ches can be obtained , limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s it was that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not be able to use them .
the patents are not only valid for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or gr@@ ated sheets .
in recent years , more of such patents have been registered for more plants such as grain or cart@@ oning sor@@ ts . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert for food safety provide the future of food production .
as passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still owns let@@ tu@@ ce , but he needs more , because his work is always worth more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is when a rock would lie in a river which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we need to make this now , but it is a break with a breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents go to sal@@ ads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new oint@@ ment , because all features are patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to recover those characteristics that he wants .
however , however , he is very careful and ende@@ av@@ ed to use no material that is being protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is always bigger in the United States and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ness of the station &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is not a co@@ incidence that this name is rather low as the movement from the IT sector come and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some species of plant species and gene are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , Oss@@ i called Oss@@ i , you can commit to use US bre@@ eders that others can be able to use seeds from them .
however , this does not mean that they are not able to do business with their seed and it can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow others to cross it to cross your own varieties , and it is not immediately super@@ flu@@ ous - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plants pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
sc@@ iss@@ ors prospects
Professor of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i @-@ member of the University of Wisconsin , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seeds and the possibility to bre@@ athe new plants , both for food safety as well as for environmental protection .
seeds plays him a role in greater mer@@ ging how biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little to use seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg under@@ lines that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genet@@ ically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not , we would like to buy our aim of environmental sustainability , such as it is offered in August or September 2016 . &quot; he who is offered good , locally and sustain@@ ably producing vegetables , should also know that the way is far@@ med , such as such vegetables is bred .
nutritional sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty without seed sover@@ eign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative agree to make other their seed remains freely available . in contrast , their approach to pat@@ enting seed and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i Suppor@@ ters argu@@ ing that the future of food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed because the available com@@ pool due to the increasingly important spiritual property rights on plant material , which is always restricted restricted .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , has joined in her PhD thesis with genet@@ ically variation in carrots and their availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of all map characteristics are being protected as intellectual property , making it not available for plant breeding .
there are such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suppose that mass@@ ac@@ ed plants are patented , as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots .
a question of Vis@@ itors
plants are so far@@ med that they have targeted features - from such that their taste or its color improves up to such , due to them th@@ ri@@ ves and thre@@ ats in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties refer to that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is taking over and more patents . genetic diversity is currently being necessary than ever before , as the changing conditions is much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ man Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to know that genetic variety is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four cooperative banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company set itself for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , they contra@@ di@@ ct that intellectual property cabinets , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant variables are fo@@ ster . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow , as soon as the patent expi@@ res .
often these instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result .
such protection in@@ hib@@ its innovations not , but promotes it by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the different way : 20 years to wait until a patent can be stack@@ ed , and certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to wait for plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight .
the main argument of Mort@@ on is however that genetic resources have been always been a general practition@@ er and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and months are not attractive for us .
we want to facilitate farmers .
this is what drives us , and it is impossible to use us if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on inter@@ f@@ ere with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we are creating the characteristics not really itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plants form them away and as a bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how the plants do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Oss@@ i board , there are still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who em@@ bra@@ ced a variety of plant breeding , and his own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are necessary for growing her@@ b@@ icides , breeding in its varieties of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is perfectly ge@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but less than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have , creating the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either re@@ ject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
Frank Mort@@ on is based on his breeding garden sal@@ ads .
photo of Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders could be more innovative by the Av@@ oid of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented .
I need to use new stuff for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my sor@@ ts for a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent for 20 years is protected from competition , where you can easily make my opinion quite nice . &quot;
although the USA seem to be a leader in the Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept spreads very quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program works by the center with farmers and helps them to meet new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports you to sell to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and to sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Oss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding they differ from country to country if Oss@@ i are not just taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declares that conventi@@ onally cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which is based on conventi@@ onally cultivated plants .
however , an explanation is not yet any law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring to the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , based on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and agents from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the orientation of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems declared that the organization is currently able to build a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which should be scheduled for scheduled next year .
a merger between environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , which publishes global alliance for the future of food - a ban and aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report . in this respect it represents the opportunity to facilitate and improve seed policy , so that a stable supply can be ensured with food products .
in this report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphas@@ ises - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of Oss@@ i , hopes that more people will be recogni@@ z@@ able soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food , above all , where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to clear men that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organisation and Blogs are the latest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
always un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human Rights organization and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of the 5th August the Egyptian government closed the website of the german Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a position on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp , and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the guaranteed Network for Human Rights Information remains in spite of this attack and the inheritance of the Egyptian law and the Constitution through the authorities , to defend this part of the world , so that all technical possibilities should be exhau@@ sted to overcome and not follow them . we hope to meet our task . we hope to meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first licensed website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities covered more than two months 21 pages , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that of Qatar . &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the shaft of the we@@ avers to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i has one of the main data sources for human rights in arab@@ ic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to learn more in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of column and articles that he writes in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he established in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ at of the Egyptian government , even aim to attack a attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider is native to the Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during the December 2013 , while he took part in the student protests and recorded a video , just like the police physical violence against two students .
his article is mainly due to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed the re@@ locking by the government and refle@@ cting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to un@@ lock is very old , but has no priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It happened to give me the feeling of a siege to forgive ; one arrest , a su@@ cking murder , pre @-@ charge of the national Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs and any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) You have demonstrated that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only a little audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles to get the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after they have closed him and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ g go through the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this was the technical testing of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the locking of providers that was possible through the conversion of Internet @-@ sur and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , 12th of June we recorded as the re@@ jection of web pages , which began to offer V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
a such practice indicates that the government &apos;s intention to block content to block content and might have access to the Egyptian users .
the situation will be avoided by this way that the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ment decisions can be met behind closed doors , thereby ensuring the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using it before court to go against this actions .
now the question is : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day for day report on newspapers in Brazil with des@@ per@@ ate head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of various postcards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es were killed by military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation , the European Union in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called even to access the United Nations .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
so the news published for the detailed report on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16th , the editorial article &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; war in Rio . &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crime , which happen in any major city on the world as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual violence , etc . everything that happens from the civil@@ ised standard and what only in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to close our eyes as journalists in front of the atro@@ cities .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war bri@@ k in a country which didn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper stated that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is distor@@ ted , also , atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions , too .
but we defend war based on information and fight against corruption at the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of m@@ af@@ ia and its partners .
would the name &quot; war &quot; more than they used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira to record the violence as &quot; war &quot; . this is their opinion after a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and might make it easier , responsible for the police on account .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as Extra in the analysis of the mil@@ itar@@ ily rate in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ f@@ eit negli@@ gible of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violent city in Brazil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we watch the Mor@@ dr@@ aten one in the state , Rio is at No. 16 , &quot; writes them .
in addition , extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , emphas@@ ises like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeated the security policy of the State since years .
one of these safety policy measures also belonged to the founding of U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia , fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose goal was to conquer a Fav@@ ela by a massive police charge and a unit permanently station@@ ed there .
at the beginning this resulted in a decrease of forced deaths . for some years the U@@ PP has been able to protect many reports about sh@@ ik@@ ans and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the neo @-@ aff@@ ecting police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his article from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention on the basis of &quot; civil war &quot; .

many governments , international organizations and Syrian opposition are based on the basis of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acres committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these reb@@ els controlled areas outside Damascus has stood under siege under the siege , which led people on local or separated by tunnel and control points .
through the years long block@@ ade , traditional food and meat are become accessible for large parts of the population .
as a return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to conventional , in Syria planted food and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it possible to an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the Project , subscription Nab@@ il , said opposite the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we chose us for the cultivation of mushroom because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project is well @-@ known and pressed his relief , that it won more and more &quot; of acquain@@ t@@ ness . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian co @-@ platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ as .
it is planned to mediate 125 families knowledge to plant@@ ing pilgrims , Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this writing , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is based on generators which maintain temperature at 25 ° C and humidity of 80 % .
because of the fuel cris@@ p , locally produced fuel are used locally used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from regions of the fung@@ al seeds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality , whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small Pil@@ z@@ hof in a tank . when this was succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have created a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have been spread everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that there is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring the people to fung@@ us from various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread of a culture of self service by eating food ( such as paper , tea , coffee rate , cardboard , etc ) to profit new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so our success and our fight against hunger and the siege is visible .

a far @-@ reaching proposal to the forest form , which had launched the government after severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was brought by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity of the case , if the applic@@ ant was built on funds for self @-@ protection - this was an open back@@ door , so that everything was built , &quot; performs João Sor@@ val in the same article on the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ enton .

the project was launched in 2015 by developers João P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was decisive at this fat@@ eful weekend in October such that the servers have followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users who followed fires , did not exceed the website more than half a million .

the path from refugees from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group meetings that had defeated the short @-@ lived per @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a land of terror and desp@@ air .
just at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i , together with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother did not know it then , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning grey the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , who dominated the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , was murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly .
they were closer to their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
a few years long he worked in a coh@@ ort . the work was heavy , and made it sick .
then he took up what was remaining in Iran , and went into Iran . once again he was found in a foreign country along with other refugees and towing sacks with mort@@ ars , who were heavier than he himself to make his living .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remin@@ ded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hanged nylon in front of the open window , that we don &apos;t harm the night at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
at the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered a ship and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af hom@@ eless , just ran through the streets of Rome , close to the park and went to a church that shared twice a day food to help needy .
indeed , Italy is true that Italy is a kind second chance for wet asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are cat@@ astroph@@ ic in the country .
the Human Rights Organisation , Civil @-@ Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system will suffer from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special Recording Cent@@ res . &quot; there are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a recording centre if they officially put an application for asylum - which can withdraw from asylum in months after the registration of the asylum request .
until then people who have no money for a property , either on the hospitality of friends , or have to sleep on the street .
so it came to A@@ shar@@ af .
but his uns@@ killed life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free from these conditions .
after having made several years of work in the construction industry several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire results into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well that he opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the topic of the handic@@ apped Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was launched in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
plenty of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for credits are only some of obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghanistan businesses were created , including dress@@ ers , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mainly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of restaurants tells by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome also are Afghanistan .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to submit far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic industries and retail , and targets back to the country which he had to leave for teen@@ ager than teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my land and I can &apos;t live be happy if I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and have to receive the same possibilities as every other . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af avo@@ red plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , who can learn packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but at the end there is stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip itself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .

the Egyptian parliament exam@@ ines a bill that shows social media such as Twitter or Facebook to use only after registration at a government authority .
users would have to use social networks to use social networks within six months after the application of the authority on the website of the authority , as well as their reference number .
those who missed this step might be sentenced to six months in prison or the en@@ dow@@ ment of a penalty .
the law , which was approved by sixty members of parliament , is currently to the processing and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the Congress was filed , in which the har@@ der pen@@ alties for insul@@ ting the president or a high civil servants would be introduced .
under the Egyptian law , the interests of the president and state facilities is already stra@@ f@@ able . however , such a state of law would have been corrup@@ ted with prison and fin@@ es , so right @-@ wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law was adopted , this means that up to three years in prison can mean for the convic@@ tions .
in addition , this would be an political climate , in which the right to free expression and assembly of freedom for many years has been in danger for many years .
a mark@@ er example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he had demonstrated Egyptian police officers , who had led violence against the military p@@ utsch against the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for just as more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested at the same incident , four years imprisonment on a court .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to the 20th May , because the prison term according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused of prison in the court room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to a , so many human rights groups are ein@@ ed , head@@ lamps of others , illeg@@ itim@@ ate assembly , murder , and su@@ prem@@ ise murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ fac@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ es@@ ian activists viol@@ ently listen to documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the pol@@ r of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .

the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website th@@ rows a light on how the Presi@@ dential plans look like to support the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources under the article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press department , which ensures the right to protect their sources .
despite this , he entered the case in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
will China force social media force to submit their identification ?
according to the new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission to write messages in social media or share .
in addition , the registration is stated that the registration will be required with the full re@@ usable name .
analysis shows that the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments may be achieved in entertainment within social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese nets were proposed in the social media that only select these regulations to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence .

a Turkish court had the blocking of Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information , Turkey under@@ support the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication were closed , the page was closed to &quot; an information source that works with groups in order to tackle a political reducing campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey is completely blocked by Turkey . it is therefore , besides China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
