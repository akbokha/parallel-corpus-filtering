<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is exceedingly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have read about American music, American authors and his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound profound effect on me that I was mainly used for a American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter that covered with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student, the Supreme Court with judges who wanted to attract his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it if it is the absolute truth, forget all the other things that I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had further strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I said," "" "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you're always to be who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equality." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very weak love cover written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenity and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is to me as he is surrounded by its Engines.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops with his opinion behind the mountain, as one says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he considers, like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerer and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and approved in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won by the Republican elections, was the highest number formed by the Party nominated.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigs person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to bring out Trump and his voters with people in harmony which I had learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, people from around the world began to talk a deep breath of man, with whom I had talking about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps did not illustrate the world with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," agreed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to look at the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intoleranz is also in contrast to the greater movement that I experienced in Sandy Bahr who struggled with Sandy Bahr and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It even fits them to the commitment of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with patience and suffering from my colleagues, to get the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, who has helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who shortened my love deepened my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">During Trump in his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart in its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The struggles with the idea that people voted for Trump because they were either his racism and fanaticism, because they were ready to see these things, my heart broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unknown to draw the trump-voters as root.</seg>
<seg id="34">People to arrange people said one of my friends, is exactly what has led to us in this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different way and do.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about hectic changes will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those electors have voted for trump because they wish to rebel control over a country that they disappoints?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they would perhaps say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who read the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with regard to those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Anm.).: as much as" "" "Rejection of white toward all other ethnications" ""; vocabulary from white in play on the White and Belplash, which means the great Van Jones called exactly what happened to America so great. "" "</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you might have always like, America is really welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country selected as his presidents, twice the son of a Kennel whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of white America's promise and says: to Hell with versatility, religious freedom and the entire term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the rest, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the choice.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word-change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The multitude answered with a loud voice "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"have Muslims in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" broader the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latinos place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a space in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were pure.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if any man, who doesn't like you, is a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an impressive and loud-strong "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "God be thanksgiving, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was replenished.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps country, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find no more space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaische Stadt Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby Colombian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: an opportunity for children and adults of existing Symphony Orchestra, which has found their musical instruments with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its Drugs abuse and Banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots, who started a musical project and offered the youth as a rare hopper.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI believes:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they go through the dusty streets to follow their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero is playing the children of Cateura - a village situated at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in the capital - on instruments which are made from re-evaluation waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments which consist of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling was started under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate covetches, viola, Celli, double basses, guitars, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez recalls a local scholar and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning of time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them are not living together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: one from waste produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recovered material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation of "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as humans in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were accordingly exhausted and slightly inclined, a law crushers are welcome to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorambique, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to kill one of its harbours and refused to share a fishing body.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply denied everything," "" "reminds us Kiilu, a senior executive of the kenian fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship in a stone time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out from the waters of the region: it wasn't possible to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The nucleus of this initiative, which crosses the criminal practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had sold out the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that interminded and work together. they can exchange information and stand on each other side where it comes to illegal fishing" "", "Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charges Project Ending illegally illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to print. thus, the illegal fishing is a main cause of the regions of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate abuse of existing laws, which should be protected by certain habitats and types, the illegal fishing industry damage can harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during the actions against illegal fisheries once caused by bureaucratic hurdles, these actions are competing in real-time with the information between individual countries, and these actions are in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There you can exchange the individual countries for such a lists of existing licenses, news to suspect activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port spection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea, by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to describe ships to fish that fishing in forbidden areas - such as such that a ship invites you to catch his caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing boats can be found on the basis of this information, the assumption of such ships can be refused to sell their load. and that they could not be forced to sell their cargo, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "then, in order to achieve significant losses for the owners, meaning that the illegal fishing catch is financially worthwhile anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to reach, "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing companies in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win over $20 million in lost sales to win the eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to the illegal fisherman that enters into Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms, leading to the region's commercial fisherman from all over the world. under these also, illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions like the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying imaginations, fish protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "you utilize the missing international cooperation and do the weaknesses of a non-consistent control system." "" "says Long." "" "a ship could not be illegal and a country could say 'You're not able to run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legalized Schlupflew FISH-i tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the connected front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 investigations of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been revealed criminal networks, who had fake fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships, which used several deceitful identities, and has found winged ships and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Thanks to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight of crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing companies across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us fairly far into the networks of organizational crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that aims to help FISH-i, suspected ships of precise ships.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be developed further, helps to hide the illegal ships that would like to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, where they can no longer be operated by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to help criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence influence on the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown by means of the position each of the traceable ship worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="142">There is signs that FISH-i's activities did not only feel crime novels, but also shout.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships, who had to be fished without licence in former license and hardly with consequences we know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fishing sales since then to buy more licenses.</seg>

<seg id="148">There are six countries gathered together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. the aim is to tackle the illegal fishing industry, according to the same model as FISH-i.

<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia was able to report his first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was under false flag. and not only the ship was used without licence, which is now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also kept in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the take-rules of Greko 1 set the strong signs to go against illegal fishing catch, "says Bergh.</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes examined were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not sought his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the brush, same name as his father wear the brutal Milanese perperations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He held the family of family for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you are not noticed that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, folks and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was his father Luis Alberto Quijano. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of State terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services 141 in the La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the history of Luis Quijano, the oppressed because of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the magnitude of the atrocities that he had experienced in his own father in the course of the years.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent over his child, and as this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take Me to the military base, I often walked with us into the sports hall. there I had a boy with a boy, the martial sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>

<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open room and said:</seg>

<seg id="238">I spun in, and saw a song that were tortured on humans.</seg>

<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also officer of Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and to steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers were opened to a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driver's license, in the last month's witnesses of an especially dispossated translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word (koreifensha), the "older drivers" means, but perhaps even with bagued backing & # 8212; translated as "terrible drive."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was available on electronic ads in the input range and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was divided in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, a population of Kyotos, fallen. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun newspaper, written in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no man has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is a compensation for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply inacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The defective English translation was initially removed. the label "(German:" terrible driver ") was later replaced by the appropriate, if also grammatical does not replace the label" Elder drivers "(german:" older drivers ").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Police of the Prefecture of Kyoto claims for the translation errors. furthermore, it stated that the error was already in the text that they had been tested by the translators and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before they were published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "sorry," "" "I'm sorry that older people feel insulted through the inadequate correction (the translation)," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast news set a detailed report with the phenomenon of the "awesome" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "became an unreasonable description of elderly drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but absolutely reason to worry." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture for example, 1,941 of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, which equates to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, the senior citizens declared 1.803 of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important abilities: passive language skills to understand and active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of mother's language. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French mother tongue should translate from English to French - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as the native language that might have translations into English. this may seem to lack of understanding, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English speakers, which can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, which have no foreign workers, have their own foreign employees. then, the Japanese company, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best. - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and vented propositions which are produced by machine translation shows that this technology can't replace other human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English forums in Japan, including also the enigmatic imprints, which often use T-shirts or pockets are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry nor unacceptable or at least be harmless. but by major companies or from the government who have funds to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The City of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report from Kurd, which is published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series with the title "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("Faster cows, attacking schools,") published by Global Voices Latin America and re-released.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where they were not living together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her studies in the university, she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on her. "she is as a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "he who has become something has become" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a large family with little money over their minage son or her minderson daughter to another, abundant family. in the thousch the child will receive food, an apprenticeship, and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned here is that the children must pay for countless days of housework which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse, and all that cannot be raised within the framework of a contract which cannot be raised.</seg>
<seg id="425">In Paraguay, this is widespread in Paraguay with the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - above all young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimony, calculated and prolonged.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated in Crime, is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double topping, explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is one of the family that their daughter in faith, that they will improve their apprenticeship, improve their position in society and "something made of" a different family. "</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, which takes up the girl with itself, and whose exploitation is justified with the belief that they would give someone a chance that would not have any training, and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is harassed, his family will get out many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experienced it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in paraguayischen households in January 2016, is a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n entered the hospital in CaaguazÃº, their body showed traces of severe slings. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Criadita in the household of the former military nationals, TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer in the inhabitants of the population.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016 Ferreira dropped on MarÃ­n as long as it suffered a deadly injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They found that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela accounted for deep in the paraguan Society of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest and demanded that there were "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," accused Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier, unpunished the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control among which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married state and almost 60 civil society organisations requested a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want that TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes before court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Criadazgo.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The criaditas shall not only be explored as working forces, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farmers, who had worked in her father, had to register and lost her father her father.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all work and started to sell money on the road or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita in the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">So they had to divide the time so that you still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, they cleansed the fridge, pushes the living room, polished the furniture and the infected ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they were done with learning, the more leisure had it.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture by Pixabay, changed by global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Posted in Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently approved a bill to "the regulations regarding use and commercial social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When it is assumed by Parliament, users and social media have to register in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is commissioned to use civil servants and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, users have to register with their correct name and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it will be missed that this could bring a penalty of up to six months or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six paragraph and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that runs over the internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video equipment and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is assumed, as Egyptian authorities should not allow users to register the users who are not able to register for the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul saddle, parliamentary committee, and promoter of the Legislative Decree, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and user received a password to come by the firewall through the firewall.</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to establish a firewall at national level around Facebook. due to them it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far to exist such plans.</seg>
<seg id="512">Expert experts and experts on site are skeptical concerning the technical feasibility of the demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist, "the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, on German" Egyptian Initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strong in the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they were forcible in physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I accept them, then it means that they may apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizen or not. and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and to bring it to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature's legislature and the constitutional committee before it comes into the plenary session.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military monument in the Parliament, in which the senses will maximizes and ensured that no separate Narration is present on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the Parliament ordered Tamer El-Shahawy a Legislative Decree against Cyber-Crime, who had a life imprisonment for those who are guilty to threatening the "public order" and to protest the "public order."</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards, which is surrounded by Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are given by Wilderei, the loss and freight of their habitat, and because they always find less prey, endangered.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "the Persian is the only remainder of the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and the thrives of the ecosystem also depends on it that a big robber is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards in the wild bowel actually is small and goes to zero. when the team in the video shows that she had a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained Biologin Raza is passionate about another side of their country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in wild animals since six years and participates in wild animals.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the liberal daily Kahoku Shenno, proposed for the North Japan's competent daily Kahoku Shenno, which were affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011, had an enormous earthquake, an tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shenno-Zeitung is based in Sendai, the prefecture of Miyagi, prefecture of Miyagi prefecture in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbor cectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced evacuated, because the tsunami had totally vanished from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even in addition, the prefecture of Fukushima had experienced a nuclear accident, so that about 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shenno shows from a local point of view which were reached after six years in order to rebuild the life of local population.</seg>
<seg id="549">The full report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of Japanese rebuild authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shenno Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (allowed, ordered, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi's biggest success could be seen among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light on Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="554">Even though, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated the evacuation of accommodation shelters (committed, kasetsu juutaku) were settled into final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated Fukushima still live in notation, while Miyagi was successful in emergency shelters. more than 75 percent of evacuated people were displaced after the desaster, were moved to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shenno-Newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, did not open their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, killed in the three prefectures agricultural land in people.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its land areas, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a sequence of nuclear power is, because only 690 hectares of land destroyed from Fukushima in the "nuclear weapon of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered all the way back again but also remains undefeated in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima move only 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shenno newspaper also reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their habitation.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population being prepared to the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total picture, the newspaper conducted numerous evidence under the native population and evacuated by the evacuated population. she asked them about the stand of the rebuilding and even as their indignation has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article, Kahoku Shenno-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shenno resulted in a survey in order to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in the experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the local population has taken refuge in order to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima had to be evacuated</seg>
<seg id="576">In their edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shenno-Zeitung has increased their attention to the position of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience just the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima had also been a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear war, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture were moved out of 160 000 evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were some more than 23 000 people back to Fukushima in permanent replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophic areas, most of the evacuated people still fail to get known as well, because the efforts for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to be competing with massive construction projects. this involves construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories moved to Cuba for the doors (photo: Julio Batista).</seg>
<seg id="627">The Volksgregation Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, who is located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in spanish sugar mill - known that there is no significant sugar content in the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were manufactured in the sugar cane mills.</seg>
<seg id="629">After obtaining the sugar cane industry in the region quiet, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent himself.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some sort the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commutes daily to factories which still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteran, who stands every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry cannot get his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar cane mills, who have been in operation after long intact time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers that in MaÃ±alich will receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resists the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the poor government decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production of 1.6 million tonnes of sugar was produced, less than the 1910 produced amount.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country some decades a motive for the country, but the bad harvests have been no rejection anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the village saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need: the 155 sugar tubes factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive, they were unbeatable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories requiring annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plants and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">Between 2017 and 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Landscape Prospects" from the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural Organization and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production level has reached the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "the current day will come with security in history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the disclosure of a total of 98 sugars factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">It happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeated most often, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first shooting year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially adopted by these documents, which would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed, the address at and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulan Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could not have any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was transferred and the letters came to more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-up factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still operational sugar cane mills.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for retirement in another complex, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will at the standings of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part which he removed, he removed his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace was deleted.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for work stations and services, which were generated by plants in the municipalities were created, in which they were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammalogy speech of 21 October 2002, the then President in the eyes of the present persons looked, when he guaranteed for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the Gregorian community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich discovered that many things change, but not always to better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar tube factory closed, or better, when they started, they abhate them, they listened to the asphalt road, this is advantageous and other firms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are busy with topics that are important for them. they are doing hip hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour since 2014 workshop leader mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten creams and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group of The Northstars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop therefore represents that the young participation in the conversations topics such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable," or whatever is to be found in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winzago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemmucose First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate as important the receipt of traditional customs and customs of war despite the influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in Indian languages, although the young people do not always have to rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people gathered some help from Gary Jolly by the Northstars Hip-Hop-Group, who lieve them a Strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N 'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in the address, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like that none of me are interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on the earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day that you will take to our carpenter</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise us a day</seg>
<seg id="710">I would not see how to live a bad life</seg>

<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of animal polÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central almexiko.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence than normal, no matter, in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I know the disease and Sensational journalism now for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come on daily newspaper kiosken every day and see the title pages with pictures that can only be taken from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It takes me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only thing I am pressed or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be equal to or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin remember that he is great. and it is not normal that people listen to the "Labours" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, that, when would they lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear of them that something happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are to blob numbers in one statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The elessness of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is justified that they were "grown-up."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak that they spared from such a tragedy, if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of compressage in the main city." it describes how armed crime month was plundered, until it was not only destroyed the business by the end, but also their family torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never claims that trauma remains high, the fear of fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">Each further we are removed from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested, because the others are arrested, because they don't know when they will lead you or kill.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would resolve my deep root feelings, but the answer is no, for I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence called."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions to such as: who cares about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was killed by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to increase in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexican?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other young boys of his age, whose parents will take care of her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he had to bring himself to himself as one eggs, potatoes, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the kittens will live with him. this is his name for the preparation of flask with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left Bone - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he had seen just a few blocks from his home, the bloody Leiche of his father, who was shot by armed men from a foreigner car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence through the organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder according to the government Council for public security and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor counted 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Mords per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of thousands, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of always new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who we don't forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco," animal polÃ­tico "has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to set complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has shown the country over the past four decades, in understandable way.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the years that something is dipped for the first time? content in social media, whether it's true or untrue, tend to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used irreous to consider tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupler from picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny that there are plenty of careful reporting regarding events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it poses questions about our desire for pictures to News.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa, Africa's second largest country was neglected and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of impact holes that were difficult to drive.</seg>

<seg id="829">Houses are brushed and stolen bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to trouble.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture of the title" "" "This is Nigeria" "". "by Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Multiple pictures of the pretext form the grey scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stolen bodies, which are rounded up on the ground for persons.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here is the story not to end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was fished by several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but real but not that in connection with regard to tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the unlegenic villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Augenzeues reported drastically by atrocities which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count corpses," said a population on Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were zqued, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite images the follow-time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unexplained, but the army base in Bagha was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win the Boko Haram, land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the DR Congo appeared again, as evidence for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this malignant use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false descriptions; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was brought to a cover for massage redness.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments, like this example, the image from the DR DRC uses sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange has also been in connection with the deadly persecutions of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to an error, published by the United Nations, those who were trying to flee rakes, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, Posts reported that these descriptions were assembled with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acididi Arab News page, which in 2012 claimed Mr. Myanmars Thein His said, Monks and politician gave himself to the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two powerful themes or frames (penetration) that crosses this post. the first frame focus on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of major discussions about silence in relation to the murder of Christians by Muslims, or to the defence of Muslims - exhortation of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is rated as comparison with a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it's worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is however, what happens if readers can not give this images to no longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are only human beings who unintentionally unintended to trise the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "" "" "sugars" "" "sugars and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and tastes the actual tomb of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">The argument is that the holding of images of a refusal comes to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures will even be asked by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that forcible images and viewers desperize the ability to stamp empathy (such as this study, seeking to work as violent media on it, others to help).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is some time to discuss forcible representations in the news media, fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting this because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will thoroughly solve the situation in which a picture was somewhat sugared, but actually replaced by the context or to completely misuse species.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation, however, should also be considered to be considered internationally.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e.g. unsupervable) endeavoured to provide language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese Saudi) and others, which are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sauce farm).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubble every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not sufficient to understand why a full explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand what a word is meant.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists of Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the sale of Vanuatu, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - BemÃ¼h to give you your parents in recognition of what you have been working for yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words present in the Hunsrik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - Compatibility or Faulty, which one feels, after that it is violent in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They deloops other cultures, roaring other thoughts and webs our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, as we have the world to analyze and classify the linguists on this page, we want to publish more this "invisible" words, and show how different, valuable and impressive in these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Redner of the "Treasure Languages," which are very appreciated by Untranslaterable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, on different art. but somehow we all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why do I feel that here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who has shown us how wars are guided and people through the work of the "other" in the public presentation, four decades of science was conducted by Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We must show ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of his, deliberately and inaware the "other" too hard; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women's March, because he had not bombed a new future, while it already capitulated countries and "to others" people were bombed, far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to enter here and now despite a language barrier to someone with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the number of stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a brief initiative of Steven Bird, the Untranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus is not written by TLS on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of large cities and to destroy.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or in Oakland, where TLS has already been conducted since 2015, the risk that small and not all small languages are not given to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we do cities, accept diversity - safe spaces, in which residents do not need to be attributed to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening is often linked to understand" understand these events instead "the listeners to appreciate, to feel good."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, history counter will initially set their history in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants have no professional history counter, their commitment and its representation is that the audiences can be attached to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round the history of history of Rassidatou consulate also take the opportunity to clarify for their land for the customs of customs.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the folding of the bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having declared the importance of his foal, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to talk to an audience, that your language does not understand?" with a wide grin, he divides his feeling of infos:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of the Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place, and the organisers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can organize with TLS in contact to organize your own history of history.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: PUBLICA, the annual conference on the digital culture organized in Berlin, dedicated to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the German-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of the book-called 'Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, bubbles from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Incorporation (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published in the last year and is licensed free here, includes a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of the repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to know how to build movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are connected to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activist, artist, designer, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have been involved, to watch over the fog that gives our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet-volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra-prison in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about his current state or dwelling place since then.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that would fall on his release, and they want to know it back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel is paying a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us will start to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we now here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we do in this process of temporal extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution which was transferred to an unknown village.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer at Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Based on the command of a military court from his cell in Adra had taken."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by individuals on 12 November 2015, who committed themselves as an inscribed-Assad government, and they set them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His dwelling place and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved on projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in the access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently translating the head of New Palmyra, a project which founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes are predicted as the work which he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the waypoint of numerous civilisations and here merging Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesful traditions and personic influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS had all to put everything that is not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world embodies.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip has created in the digital archaeology and maintenance has created a time capsule, which will be open to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragedy this project could not yet close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life to dream of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read English well, to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with everyone who has asked him. he has taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel is open to me the gate. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other inadhered, as they use computer, at least theoretically, without having held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a Provisional Application, which she wrote in jail from 2012 to 2015 when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1253">Now we repeat our claim in hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, responding to liability again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambience reacted by wrath on a corruption, who returned a government member after half of his sentence to the workplace in the State apparatus, in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other accused due to unfaithlessness of 54 million Metikal (approximately 800 000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds in the airports of Mozambique whose Council was Chief of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good guided tour and immediately asked his revocation to the company, which took place on 19 April then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General Attorney of the Republic which received the request, there was no obstacle for Cambaza, returning to his old post, since the company did not finish a discipline process after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">But many inhabitants of the action are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integration (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), an local institution which establishes itself for public transparency, sentenced to the company's decision by the Deutsche Welle in an interview with the Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a return in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a return to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have knowledge is that the company should have a discipline process against the immediate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was apparently, however, however, does not have a reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambique social media, rejects this behaviour also and considers the case as "conflicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of them has eaten.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating words, he could consult and his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has prepared to become reintegrated into the company that he helped damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and student of political sciences in Brazil says the director had no Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded from the state because he tried him, I can't believe someone who has rewarded someone to such a way that the state has already been drafted so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return to the state and serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only himself served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, when handing it became a inexhaustible money source and the state itself became tired of this man that was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was awarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte preferred it to remind the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel, the Mozambique is not only for ever as the first independent President in Remembrance, but also as a sharp, emitting and - prophesy in the way - prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of its most famous oral representations had confirmed that "an ambitious man confirmed that" an ambitious human being able to sell his own individual interest, to sell his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samah said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being decriminated at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also canceled:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat 10 years and came free.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posture from the net because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although on the Origin of the Word still is discussed, it is usually used to report on people East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Instructive."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook announces the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or guaranteed." "" "(in bursing lettering) as part of an initiative to tackle the far widespread problem of hate languages in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the Ascenic national movement has given the word to an extremely abdictive tonnotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as Hasstalk against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight against them in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensible content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'today is normally associated with racism in connection, but the Word does not call on automatically Hassle.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people reported that Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or doubts for his use of use, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several bursing words with basic meanings, which have the same book sequence like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, such as other words such as' Kalar pae '(Spage bays),' Kalar paat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he had asked his friends in the spiritual way, whether they knew how he had left his back pain by doing a vocal.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The movement KU la - "healing" (KU) + the Fractment (la) on Burmese - similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that they decrease in English language of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook will be analytic, before all the posters that are suspected in the suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook deletes the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you are on facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do instead, the post is carefully directed to analyse and control it by sending the words to the present words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, Kalar Htine "(Chair) and" Kalar pae "(spokes).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three thousand nationalists who hate them, a very good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is at the time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action can send a strong signal to everyone who hate them, do not want to keep the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship will often start to use a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook started to quit his post when he wanted to leave his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was looking attention to this new Directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post has been removed from Facebook and told me the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post "the Facebook Community standards did not escape."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts from people, who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the Hassle radio nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed, who has nothing to do with hate languages:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hasselt from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are poorly in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook in the start of the initiative would have to do more than the Burmese Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a beneficial intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to zenry is to kill even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it seems that if they started this without local context or technical support, as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "inheritance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they tried not to report the accidentally deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they have only something more respect for the 15 million benefit, which would have a large turnover, would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has ensured a lot among users among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of serious, users have fun on Facebook, and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassle, to see if their Posts will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook postcards that have no hate languages, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch the peas and view a Indian movie.</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalist alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, English language in social networks will heat the violence in Myanmar in addition, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists were forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his conviction that I would speak with them to his burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just like the word 'Kalar', it would have better been running better in context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN-Convention on Human Rights, which is the Minority Year when people under 18 years old. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 were married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, who were involved to abolish laws or children, followed on the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, it was not all smooth.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu Guide, e.g. had no concerns to say the critics of the children's before, they should be damned again to worry about their own matters. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition could actually be part of tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and sometime there were doubt if the Opposition would agree to the bill of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 transmitters (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which was discussed at the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country have to vote and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators gave a status update which has again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill to the children before was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes against it and none.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he was decided in the Senate, the draft can now be changed to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws had been changed to children before finally.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who was a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary Gerede, that has closed the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's nearly worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was my opinion, it's definitely long enough to do the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas passed that the day was finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Ehegesetz has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society that is quite open to them how important the passage of the law noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft resolution was adopted today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 deputies and of which 35 were present at the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members agreed to have approved the law for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's arrival is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childbearing board.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have brought him out.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A Thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary General of Sanatan, Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Six months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to do the judicial steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, thought it would be quite right when Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most of the social media users, the debate would be related to the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell defeated:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussion about the discussion so much, in a way that we may agree to the state that we may agree to the state that they may need to prevent our daughters that they may be misused by large, hard-related men, who, would you be willing to bring together the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether there is a judicial approach against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children is legal or still the norm, although there is laws that they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, reciprous to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than one month, Turkey has now lock the popular and on the Crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to help helmets and reliable information and share.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV series are against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technician users are used to use changing tools for block websites (a current article from New York Times reports that Turkey has not the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users are not listed in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unlocked articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regularly since 2007, after the Internet Act (Nr. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country of the world when it comes to the massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, several Mirror pages (pages, reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated) are dipped.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform all Turkish Wikipedia sites on which decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which is not based on the domain name and thus makes a whole censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available despite the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set all of it to read snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. this is the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view all Wikipedia content, even if you can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is just about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the sparrow.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiyclo.org, a Mirror page of Wikipedia, as well as Wiki, an open-source project that everyone can use to be blocked by similar gurorpages when in the respective country Wikipedia will be brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and collaborators with Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Bible podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You ripens to another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Basically, the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves when they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate game photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home than me suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that on the bank of the Rapti river was a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was found and I immediately started to knee pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sing strives a cooperation with the authorities to obtain global recognition for Nepals Natural and wants to understand the understanding that wild animals are not so furious, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know it, for he stood already on face to face toward face:</seg>

<seg id="1433">Also I was in the way of the darkness at home, when suddenly the king of the Buheks appeared. he is immediately going to see us and he stened me through the trees of the trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sing placed the "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">Its passion for the promotion of Nepals of Nepals and Wildanimals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived mostly in a tent to take part in the Bardia National Park photos of Otters. up to 12 days it took to take a tiger, and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was posted by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">An revised version was again published as part of a Content-Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care, the name of their husbands or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronomic or tell "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chomisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect them as well as the fear of the social pressure, and fear of the consequences for them to preserve this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state of Oura, sentenced by a headcourt with her family and the village community after she had asked an appeal to her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition did not call their wives again in the name, but also under men it is widespread. however, they have no less assignments to fear, if they should not come after this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Wallet in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including healthcare professionals, a unique club, and thus quickly became the main discussions issue of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they discuss the hostages of the patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal which is operated by the Community's Video Volunteers and is engaged in the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas works for seven years with the help of their videocamera at the coverage of internships, such as children's heating up to the ban of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how this club was created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time as ambassador of the mural.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion group, acted by women who did not call their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It was chosen for this issue because they wanted to open the talk about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to write the name of their husbands, there is a roman who is guilty to all, and never have any question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't withholds this is considered as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deep roots that we have never made us up to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning it wanted Rohini, who had never called her husband until now, at home, at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussions round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was too late.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self confidence in luggage, Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good cause, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, offended, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them, "If we can't tell us the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want to respect it?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands on her lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra through the breaking of a century ancient tradition, in which married women will never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just before the exercise; another decided to leave the whole frustration against him and his family until they cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was static.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In the Adrenalinrausch, with an ancient fires broken, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they had the women in the head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law her mother murdered them, she was afraid and said that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini thought that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less primitive and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports, how women have tried to stop other practices, such as for example, the loss of interest in red points on the forehead, who shows the spinal status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the fascination red point if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard that in order to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not have stopped completely, but my, they are now in a better position to choose it, at some days not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out on the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to make sure that the women make sure what could hear," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cake; they danced and sang on things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working for this problems for so many years and yet I have been working on some things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husbands, even so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to tell certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion lap, we have talking about the concept of honor and as it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women have been born in the group since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted a Salad-Kurta, a wide shirt of a trousers, bear; they did not tares.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of war and discussion about the advantages of your own clothing election, the Moral connected with the Saris and much more, decorating Rohini her own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry Jeans and Rohini is sure to make it possible.</seg>
<seg id="1531">In the five months since its first discussion club has already been changed, Rohini has confirmed that things slowly come into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted a couple of time, but we left again to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women contribute now at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they would like to reach them in their lives - like the foothes to navigate more freedom of movement or your own clothing-selection - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To trust each other self-confidence, it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman believes in the club home and other people, what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made only recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published within a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of incriminated Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in the international community, after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized because of the liver cancer in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state-risk), having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China" "" "referred to as" "" "an internal issue." "" "he told it as" "" "not required to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China receives calls from the international community, Nobel Peace Laureate and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, who allow to allow him to make a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the Paares in Beijing, others are completely wiped out on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations Organization</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Liu abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell into Stocks since the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian Government believes that this is nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to absorb the salmon to China, since the exports had been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message had spread out that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to unconditional release of expression and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his detention, he was not able to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution where China was asked to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and to allow him to seek attention where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomatic mission of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called China to release Lius, as they were in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We also expect that China raises all limitations of Mr. Lius wife, as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">You should meet all the visits and they will be able to communicate with the outside world to communicate with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad told him that the Americans said to him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad unless it was obliged to help him with his comesity. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, gave the News Agency AFP on June 27, that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities refresh not only Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The rejection of the US Embassy reached a desert response from China to themselves, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country have the right to join himself and indiscriminate comments about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom like e.g. travellers and access to medical care of his choice, which they have according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as the international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US-Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz are also introduced a decision in Congress to push back the Chinese government to push back Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I challenge China to allow winning the Nobel Prize winner # LiuXiaobo unconditional, that it can be found in a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese president Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing's news agency Reuters that China had great concerns, whether the work could be supervised by Liu in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28th June, Canadian ambassador John McCallum China called for an appropriate medical care to provide a reasonable medical care and to give it the opportunity to leave from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told AFP before that Liu Xia could visit him every day but the police always monitored the room in the hospital, and that it is not allowed to speak with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">In Canada, China calls for China to safeguard its international human rights obligations, including freedom of opinion, true and unlected for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In a statement on 29 June, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a declaration of humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo all treatments will receive, which he, regardless where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family can be found in contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news of news has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there would not be any further information if France will eventually start him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the landlorries in Taiwan called for China on 27 June, and release a larger tolerance opposite to those who require peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">In Taiwan, the Taiwanese legislature, Yu Mei-nu, also called China to allow the sick of intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed very concerned in a declaration on 28 June by Liu, and gave that many him asked him to pray for Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives had taken and had been committed to a harmonious, more stable and prosperity of their China, which again contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encourages, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, as Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people were critical to the only political party of Singapore, because they compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody said in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, whereby most people go an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "logic of logic," to defend the existing authorised exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land, we hear that we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, so did the certificate of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory violating.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in view of his, he appeared unmisty.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally to those cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the subject, the good old lyre of the authoritarian seizers appear to be found, leaving the turned logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Related questions clocked with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to clear his mind, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so the country belongs to...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our werder K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point, unless it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the Blog on his comment, he tells about the critics that you should begin to understand the entire book of the conference, so that you could understand the context of statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore has a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" be considered a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven important, even if we are pleased to enjoy the free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He sold Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party of decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "was not a country," "" "he didn't know it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows its disappointment on Shanmugam, who makes a new generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said that...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that I expected - have I understood with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not sure if he really believes that it is really associated and is aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review put the weaknesses of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr Shanmugam "committed a mistake" or was it a Freudger driver?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we will only be considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is alike country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Because he plays an important role in the government's cabinet, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are the most serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do you afford your military service, but do not defend their own city?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">That is the journal Journey of a Decade for the year, Singapore and always was a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have many more than expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a town / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often listened to "the defense of the country, especially" etc., but this is not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We were rather talking about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest installment of this series comes from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is set to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, I'm sorry," "" "I am from Canada." "" "I am coming from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and again in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on which situation the conversation is held, it is considered to be polite, interest in his intergovernmental partners by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Anyway, the default answer is then the default answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many canadians may cook inside before Wut, if they are kept for Americans, but me not disturb that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many canons make a Canadian flag clearly visible on her backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">However, Americans are....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was even when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadian have always borne small horhornals on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>

<seg id="1755">Everyone seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"" "we are apparently very often" "" "excuse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposed to be regarded as the tolerant country opposite ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">I have many American friends, which I admired very admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would be nothing, if one would change me by Johnny from Dallas, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" to be called "nice," it is basically to be spawful - like the proud, gentle, gentle, but tragic figure Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (who has her own Canadian Double gÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">When Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would be a step forward. but the real problem exists that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no edges and edges, nothing that you encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, is unobtrusive and interesting to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even say so far, to say that the wish to be free and alone, a main concern of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own matters.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What can be delightful as "nice," maybe just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">They often don't talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lacks warm warm, open kindness, which I now connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) I pray Justin Trudeau the stage to show that Canadian had more than just "nice." our Prime Minister has made Canada a great sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous Pop-Band has published a music video that the Junta parodiert who ruled the power in 2014 and the civilian government to restore the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about that his friend makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly been politically, the music video refers to the continued military supremacy of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was blessed by many fans and other users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a giant-folly.</seg>
<seg id="1785">During the first three days, the video loaded on Facebook has been shared 1,254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month the Charlie Chaplin video called "The Dictator" in Thailand has been blocked after a group of activist the public to view this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy, in particular, as it is the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these photos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that have been pursued in Thailand in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the" "" "44 rules of the girl" "" "refer to the draconical section 44 of the provisional constitution, which grants the commander of the army's absolute decision-makers on important national issues." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of "Settings" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politics and other people who are considered critics by the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the implementation of the Act on Computer criminal ality, whose vage and unclear rules are often used by authorities to render activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit in the army has been set up, supervised online content and people who have been accused of having prosecuted the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand is a strict prohibition against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic stones).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems which the Junta continues to buy used is their decision to buy U-boats, although safety experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax collectors.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, even as people are thrown into a black delivery van before they bring them into an interniation camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison because they have supposedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long adherence to the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican female, a small woman with a Coral pink Brillenframe and gold colored earringen in teddy-shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. yet, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This top name is the fact that the hotel (or rather it is) has become a destination for Afrikaner and Haitians who are on the passage.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with grinding, folding walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for Hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez is telling the people in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast to call: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would like to reject it.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they don't have to pay, they massaging them with a balm the one of the long voyage.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived before a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable first name for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joinder) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family returned from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel that it fits to her since African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hopes to get to Boston to get there their husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States, normal for the first stop in South America and then go to the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had belonged to other waymen of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans're already speaking on Whatsapp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his wayleaders, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building worker at building sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa since months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mom Africa is our mother and we never let go back," "" "he answered," "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells that their guests should send their often text messages when they have continued to greet them or report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought together to prepare huts like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only sparking hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, Sackgasse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family moved to migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that Bustickets are sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, 25 people are, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking center outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declared that he knows what the guests can do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he told." "" "I have experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and help others. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid at his office.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before men who wanted to spend money from him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for a accommodation and a unknown, one allotted, has offered it to her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Some months later the family lives and tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the House of Mama Africa is all full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses please consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy about that her house is full, but it is nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she blamed them in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hairs that you have made a customer, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while they are careful with me.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install on their mobile phones an monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter-users allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the phone users in the Tianshan district of the Urumqi was given a mobile phone in which it features the regional government to install a surveillance app named Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the message it is said that the app "must notify Access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kettled the authorities also use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh was arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had installed after they had installed the app, with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the announcement of the police, the app has to determine the sources and the distribution of the terrorists and follow, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information, including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, of online scam, Trousers and Phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they are online, and to control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This App with the filters for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in a diverse way.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the remote control "state actors or even hacker can be able to manipulate the home network of a person or to steal.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications over digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the eastern and South, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme ornamentation and monitoring measures as well as routinely wireless Internet circuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter-based media Outlet "Images from File China" (bundled news in China), photos from a Checkpoint, showed photos from a Checkpoint, on the policemen unchecked the residents if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile Notification demanded that people are installing the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you come to an Checkpoint with a device without this software, it may be imprisoned until 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a return for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices that are intended to use for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through rest-out technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" China "(guaranteed publishers breaches) also released a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and thus obtain unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang are computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang to electronic handlebars.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minimize the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a US-American Human Rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published an ordinance on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to enter their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obvious to identify and annihilate any "terrorist videos," but this promotion does not violate the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole number of other possibilities, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2060">I used it to answer it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can't say more exactly when Beleidyes and strokes have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication agent.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened, was unimportant.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of LGBTQ + Community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text, recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib brings the most of its time inside; he kill it to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What if you can rely on, there is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine lips to discover her lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which had been part of them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had finished his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where she lived as a rocky (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist, who was transferred to the conservative majority and ask their old opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression by art and Rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music that often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of the entire Arab world. all of these issues are not only found in its hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that meet from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib is looking forward to someone who is not restricted by borders, and he can feel with people with people who have suffered among the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it is not open, he gains a special decline against the US-American policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, some thing associated with his identity as "Palestinian poultry has been born, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own circumstances," emphasizes Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man, while he put into two cups of nest-cafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise until sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">In addition, the Jordanian law states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sentimely called Junitag is little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the loops are lukewed coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan like a prison under the sky above, above all, when you cast a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From therefore it avoids easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - not to lander it in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry Jordi has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou 'Leila band, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary members who support the Islamic Fighting Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontiers Hamed Sinno, argued the cultural and traditional standards of the country, and the main reason for the concert tabs.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members of the Islamic coalition of Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert is cancelled due to sexual orientation of the prison.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also, the engagement of the band in affairs like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous activism, which inquire the altitudes of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila replied the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply swisely rhetork, but indeed an increasingly clear reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in the application of Hdaibs.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional gender norms to body by taking his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have abdicated sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan over the past few years, the number of Honorary moral 'has increased - the inofficial outside was dropped.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch according to its climax. in 2016, the number of Honeymoon reached its zenith in 2016. however, Jordan was still afraid that Jordan made the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried to support murders or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to decline in 1954, women who are exposed to risk-familial violence, "for uncertain time in prison," and for their release is often a year-long bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the family is necessary that the woman will happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music is very popular with great popularity and is well known to replicas long as taboo that are in its country long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib pointed out that his work is politically, but dreamed that he can separate his music, the full explicit concerns on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I wanted me a policy, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question after the Palestinian identity in an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is again on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs, which are politically politically, can be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse can be repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the other course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind market where you can get in his words, "it may be" faith or non-faith, heterogeneor homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan over the rights of pregnant women and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals still have been censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib launched an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineprogram Roya, to notice later that his comments were torn out of the context, and his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only one worked version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance compared to homosexuals is not subject to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">In Abu Nuovo, he mentioned a poets of the eighth century, which still has remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu NuWhat, who should once again work on behalf of the Caliph, was open to homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled, to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive vote will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news services ordered several former government officials and members of the teacher, with the reasoning, related to the problems related to social media to impose problems with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the Hdaibs show, only the top of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanian.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent and take-. Jordan has waided a performance for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks much slow, beditor and ineving changes. it is sure that this changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, even from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He only dreams about it, his work till Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be attaching to the help of music, art and literature of real and basic offences - and not by bombs, streamlined and artificial art. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is time, Hdaib will continue to be rapping and therefore will also afford resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the redesigned version of the message "Liebesmessages to Guerillicaster," which has published the International Online Magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This post is published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to humans that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not too much more important, people who feel out to bring their affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question was the two young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, inspired them to the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to Reconciliation), the young people exhort to write Guerrilla's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their land was a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with Guerillamovement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International applied for the signing of the peace agreement as an important that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the columbians, there is a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and around the clock, they must now have their weapons to life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which led to life in constant anguish and in some cases a deep hatred against guerrilla has to record it in their ranks, and support them with a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young column can close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former Guerillers to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare, which then shall be committed personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to Reconciliation, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this explained that we love the man that we love to write thousands of love letters, but those who forgot to need them much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told him to share his love with people who needed the most urgent adversary in this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was created, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC which now have to place their place in society. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would forgive me'</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the town council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotart reist into the camp to translate the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC exhibited so on how they had done it earlier to meet the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of underlying people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all parties. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that dawbetween," telling the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governors of Valle del Cauca Province, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the Guerilla warrior.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambook" (a kind of cottage in which the guerrilla warfare living), I saw a guerrilla warfare who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the village of Dornought.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answered a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never ever in my life, someone has something so beautiful, so I am going to answer. I suddenly run the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embellished him completely, and set me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be a fight, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something from life as war. the FARC was the only possibility to preserve him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"" "" "" "but now I know that there is a society there, who is waiting for us with open arms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned about how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion lap.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were grown up as a war, and the FARC was already in secret places.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process. now, where we have the opportunity to develop us to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles" "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people were to hear, who had never been found so far and didn't know that people who often have seen as a monster, and even experienced people who were surrounded by their habitats and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the land lives, does me hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comfort me that all men - also those who killed and so much damage have caused us to bring us a smile and a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered on the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the example of DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was made, that after deforestation peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as long inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to lift up the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that's also entirely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We use the FARC now on peace, to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology belong to them - about all those who dream by a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. dends among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminated.</seg>

<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim name, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that it is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called upon me, wrote me, strange, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of an alphabet.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required to return to Chechnya, to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd claims: some told me that I had to prove it up without the roads; others wanted I have changed the official television in Grozy, and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have KÃ¶rber size C - what would I have to say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family retries to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, not just your family, but the entire republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she placed a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened window discs and a number plate with a 95 slide.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it was clear that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends overchecks the numbering of the numbering - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to give her name, but I will say that I remember them all, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without record, without notice, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I cut my old SIM card and cast them into the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">He came and checked at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered for a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe that you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know, in which hotel you can feel. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about sex, but it is a tobacco issue.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally kCaucasian elements do I bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I wish that this seelian barrier can't be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we cover with camera, I can really trouble me how the person reminds one of their past - thus to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current location in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed away?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington in last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the time I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who made one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan it was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he completed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That's me, they probably invite their relatives to take care of the person concerned with the concerned person and at the end, proof that the so-called "glory" has experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even pregnant women kept in this secret conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, there wouldn't be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, those who have no rich relatives have been dropped or those of their relatives have been dropped by the Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be arrested there, so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they have attacked some of your village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not just disappeared, but have been dipped specifically to radicalize them.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a delay or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I have just arrived someone who was imprisoned in Argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their bending had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There were nothing new of them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so called Lord, this person was taken with themselves when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, they were not yet presented as a band, but there were no reports yet. we guess that such promotions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else should I not allow it to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and detects of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation belong already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always contributed my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already familiar to Grozny, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to lead us originally to" "" "Civilization" "" "but eventually cast us back into the stone period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had coloured lashes, wearing tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia was never boiled to me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozy there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people hit me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speechless: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spun not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often says to children, if they are funny about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes ahead of you because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never have been offended, never chased and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grant talk time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us by se, but above the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how people began in the city to change themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had sojourned and laughed, looked upon you again with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily slowed.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what job do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I earn not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still have been active as activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicates with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teetreffs, merging, I kept them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people, when I had a fluffy piece of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: apply a Hidshab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's aloud.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens which wants to make with foam in front of the mouth that there is no oscillating with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the Cabardiner who have Russians also; on all the planet it is, but it's not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"" "I am from there, so it is very pleasant to hear what to hear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go into the mosque and during Ramadan are living together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think at transidental ity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex, to make more intimate experiences. but this is a truce.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and do not kill me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I know that I myself am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warning in front of an increase of suicide in the armed Arab Ahwazi Community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region is suffering under an unusually high unemployment - and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase of self-moral.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on the 27th of August, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi Community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under Angstalls, depression, and he consented for his own help, the ability to work for his family, Ahwazi-human beings, who are working in Ahraz and anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube made video held the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to delete the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">Local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that has happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists from the site that even more men could take the life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Anwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: it was all family vets that caused by the persecution on the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families and safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a majority of Iran surviving the Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to contest their habitat by the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in all Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Anwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran's upcoming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most significant and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and discoverings.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refuses the Ahwazi Arabians systematic jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a multitude of dams, built the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are relocated.</seg>
<seg id="2418">This demons have led to the devastation caused by dryness caused by dryness, and local agriculture as well as the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youngsters now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for cooperating, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahmadazis, who completed a job, completed elementary school, 55% a further secondary school ended and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activists in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" of self-moral among the young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become more worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ahraz new to the upcoming ethnic people and an anti-Arab discrimination in the process process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions, the local Arab Ahwazi will expire the local Arab Ahwazi access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, to destroy their habitat out of their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their advantages and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even Arab names will not be tolerated, speaking for the speaking of Arab language or the carrier of arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to wear the human rights activist alarm before the situation explosives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world will rise up and being aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to the expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, there are many women - especially white women who draw themselves as intersectional feminists - with frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even have well-thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money in spite of the same education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">There are women still under strict observation when they are going to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women earlier, or later in various areas of life to a smooth blanket, and that discrimination is still rising through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware of me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer to suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I have to speak on skin colour, on black cis women, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ church or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mentioned, what kind of body, seelian and verbal have been used to keep both white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women should come together to sing "their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing" to achieve the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexual violence there is a institutions to sexually mature form rassistically motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnications and men of country earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often should be referred to as white girl as a white girl because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black donors and women have been subjected to a higher risk of risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all the women, all men and all the people always have any skin colour the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join me as a black woman who refused to take into account the iniquities of their thinking, which relate to the gender as well on the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and won't be more about my affiliation in a white feminist oriented sphere, who still struggling me and countless other black women and ever rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sounded in 1851 in her speech: "" "" I am not a woman? "" "" and also I feed me to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is written in a historical perspective, a decent and marginalized beings. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refusing to join me groupings, who absorb our customs and customs of customs in order to push their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I'm not trying to submit white women the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to keep the meaning of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to revive them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional Feminism was founded in order to give women to different hostesses and from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I draw it before me to redeem me and completely from the feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife, instead of me for a white feminist paradigm, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is important than ever before we define black women to our own performances and give us into the donkeys that are created for us by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves on this way we can also create spaces in which they are completely secure and even the spiritual, spiritual, physical, physical and even the spiritual elements that make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately will call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can be blossom in an environment in which my life neither survived, nor ignored, nor denied.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of Kurdish. the article belongs to the series # PorSermujer (# weilichefrauram) which reports about women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police Commissioner, Ada BÃ¡ez, said that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner who had been working towards violence.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship has passed over time and the police said, their statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As a further wife Balbuena was shown for mistreatment, even the inaccurate display of Ada BÃ¡ez was nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the Teufelskies of violence against women, it is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women have taken place at all, they get no support on the state in general.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also financially dependent on men who are misused. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at all of the prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhibit1 strokes and Statistical Missions and a legal system that nothing undernimmed 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It's hard to detect how many women really harassed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for genderquire at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Ella, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that are not even ansaterise the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney Attorney General 9600 displays due to domestic violence. 70% of them went on violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads arrived at the police station.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace dishes. 86% of the ads come from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically disabled, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, this statistics show no the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen female Minister Ana Baiardi will actually appear only a few of these offences. "on every woman who are reimbursed in Paraguay for mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For every woman who are reimbursed for physical abuse, two women who do not do this, declared it at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay, the prosecution authorities can not be reasonably documented, how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists were killed at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordination of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases, in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman died due to violent actions.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to go, but there was nothing to regret it.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. however, she carried out the psychic violence in one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would be a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"" "" "" "if I have read about it, I thought that only women happens to underscore them, because they can be found of violent men." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen that.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote comments on Facebook in which it described its aspects and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and telling them how he was isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorish if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to have his behaviour also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen asmuch of Carlos, and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost so, when they wanted to say that victims of mistreacts had at least a certain co-school.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which dates from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner she harassed them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you"), which consists of women all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support against each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do that which many others do not do: they take the statements of women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias we started all with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner finally succeeded to convince them that they were worless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ad with the authorities stayed without earnings and also from her relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against her former partners who developed into an unknown legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country, mainly in which it went mainly to money, power and the influence of its former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The indication of mistreatment is a path full of resistors and a fight against corruption in the justice "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also looks great problems in the use of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorEllas (# FÃ¼ry) on August 10, 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law looks to explain the Female to an autonomous offenders and harder like it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature was altered in some points to win the deputies for the law, they feared that the way for decriminalization of abortions may be banned in Paraguay and must be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had to report the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedure to bear the victims of violence at the present time, if they just want to pay and secure a safe accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective when the legislature has no adequate financial means to provide:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay abuse as part of human relationships is seen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a change must take place, that violence is no longer regarded as a somewhat small.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever believes in this facts is guilty and bears witness that the perpetrators of the perpetrators are coming.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to make long display until misuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">However, on 10 November 2016, the law was passed by the paraguan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, however, among other things, a passage has been cancelled, which had the partners in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning conciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is true as a great return.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of Kurdish. the article belongs to the series # PorSermujer (# weilichefrauram) which reports about women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than one year ago the oman authorities closed the independent Arab newspaper Azamn for their reporting on corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he was sentenced to one year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed in court but later returned later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power since 1970, after he had set his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a state of government.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, the main ministries in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and president of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The sultans of the sultans are characterised by the severe efforts of security forces, particularly of domestic secret service, including press freedom, restricts and human rights defense, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, to be intimidate and indemics.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restricts peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically, and activists, their views on the public matters of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closing, and the insurrection of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy since its inception in 2007, until it was forbidden by authorities in August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2564">The Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison penalties and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were convicted both among others because of disorder of public order, "misuse of the Internet" and "Undertration of State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was also found guilty of the violation of an audience of publication and condemnation.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 oman Rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars), after having the use of an information network for spreading materials, which could represent a danger for public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">A security deposit of 5000 oman Rial (13 000 US dollars) was established on 22 August 2016 and was released in prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2572">The Court of Appeal also raised the decision of the information Ministry to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the Court of Azamn, the newspaper considers the newspapers after attacks by the oman government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information Minister issued a statement, which was extended by the closure of "Azamn" for three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and in which the Minister stood again against the decision of the Court of Appeal, to allow the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The last time closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was injured in Oman at the youngest time.</seg>
<seg id="2577">In other injuries, for example, the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country, to its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the destruction of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the oman authorities are still not ready to prepare a complete violation of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the European authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately release and unconditional;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with His understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is very rare or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of performing medical research, there are two reasons for a missing in the field of healthcare, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious consequences than elsewhere, and missing investment for exploring this disease through the pharmaceuticals are a large problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, is carried out in Africa at the establishment of own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warriors is director of the Centre for the Exploration of Infectious disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first grading impact on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral studies at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself asked the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the samic healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warriors RW: at the moment the focus of my work is based on research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about important current scientific topics in your country and in general?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we are only solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise, we will always remain the recipient instead of myself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often well used in our environment and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it enough?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or draw here, because the financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it lasts for months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa, which should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is demand for special scientific training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, exploring the space of health, health (non-transferable and dynamic diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed, things to do, and the estimated access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding since the 1980s in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outredness, the first plant, cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton work had only been granted by his own influences and the question how many salatches can be obtained, limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s it was that more salads were patented and that he could not be able to use them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only valid for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or grated sheets.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more of such patents have been registered for more plants such as grain or cartoning sorts. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert for food safety provide the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As passionate representatives of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still owns lettuce, but he needs more, because his work is always worth more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is when a rock would lie in a river which I have to paddle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we need to make this now, but it is a break with a breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents go to salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new ointment, because all features are patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tries to recover those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, however, he is very careful and endeaved to use no material that is being protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is always bigger in the United States and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" -breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have red RÃ¶mersalat of the Sorte Outredness of the station "of the station and eaten. there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name is rather low as the movement from the IT sector come and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some species of plant species and gene are not being protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, Ossi called Ossi, you can commit to use US breeders that others can be able to use seeds from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they are not able to do business with their seed and it can sell it. "open source" breeders allow others to cross it to cross your own varieties, and it is not immediately superfluous - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plants patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scissors prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-member of the University of Wisconsin, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seeds and the possibility to breathe new plants, both for food safety as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays him a role in greater merging how biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little to use seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg underlines that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, we would like to buy our aim of environmental sustainability, such as it is offered in August or September 2016. "he who is offered good, locally and sustainably producing vegetables, should also know that the way is farmed, such as such vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereignty without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative agree to make other their seed remains freely available. in contrast, their approach to patenting seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supporters arguing that the future of food supply is endangered because the available compool due to the increasingly important spiritual property rights on plant material, which is always restricted restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has joined in her PhD thesis with genetically variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about one-third of all map characteristics are being protected as intellectual property, making it not available for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suppose that massaced plants are patented, as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of Visitors</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they have targeted features - from such that their taste or its color improves up to such, due to them thrives and threats in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties refer to that the available plant material for breeders is taking over and more patents. genetic diversity is currently being necessary than ever before, as the changing conditions is much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesman Carly Scaduto know that genetic variety is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four cooperative banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company set itself for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, they contradict that intellectual property cabinets, as "patents and the protection of plant variables are foster." a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow, as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection inhibits innovations not, but promotes it by the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the different way: 20 years to wait until a patent can be stacked, and certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to wait for plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument of Morton is however that genetic resources have been always been a general practitioner and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and months are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it is impossible to use us if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interfere with the concept of patented plant features: "we are creating the characteristics not really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">"" "the plants form them away and as a breeder, we finally have no idea how the plants do this." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi board, there are still another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who embraced a variety of plant breeding, and his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures are necessary for growing herbicides, breeding in its varieties of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is perfectly geared." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but less than Monsanto are) patents have, creating the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">Frank Morton is based on his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo of Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders could be more innovative by the Avoid of plant patrons: "it looks like that I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to use new stuff for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my sorts for a few years, "says he." with a patent for 20 years is protected from competition, where you can easily make my opinion quite nice. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seem to be a leader in the Open Source "breeding, but the concept spreads very quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, a "open-source" seed program works by the center with farmers and helps them to meet new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports you to sell to "Open Source" seeds and to sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agreements works on an "open-source" license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding they differ from country to country if Ossi are not just taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declares that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which is based on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet any law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring to the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, based on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and agents from all East Africa to learn something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend towards the orientation of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for "Open Source" seed systems declared that the organization is currently able to build a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems, which should be scheduled for scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger between environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on Eerosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, which publishes global alliance for the future of food - a ban and aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report. in this respect it represents the opportunity to facilitate and improve seed policy, so that a stable supply can be ensured with food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In this report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphasises - a connection, by the Luby of Ossi, hopes that more people will be recognizable soon.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food, above all, where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "Luby." "" "we are now trying to clear men that even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organisation and Blogs are the latest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Always unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human Rights organization and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th August the Egyptian government closed the website of the german Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a position on Facebook in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp, and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The guaranteed Network for Human Rights Information remains in spite of this attack and the inheritance of the Egyptian law and the Constitution through the authorities, to defend this part of the world, so that all technical possibilities should be exhausted to overcome and not follow them. we hope to meet our task. we hope to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first licensed website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities covered more than two months 21 pages, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and that of Qatar. "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the shaft of the weavers to the victims. @ anhri has one of the main data sources for human rights in arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no access to learn more in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of column and articles that he writes in Egypt non-accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he established in order to handle the censurat of the Egyptian government, even aim to attack a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider is native to the Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during the December 2013, while he took part in the student protests and recorded a video, just like the police physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article is mainly due to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed the relocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to unlock is very old, but has no priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It happened to give me the feeling of a siege to forgive; one arrest, a sucking murder, pre-charge of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have demonstrated that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only a little audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have closed him and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mug go through the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this was the technical testing of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the locking of providers that was possible through the conversion of Internet-sur and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12th of June we recorded as the rejection of web pages, which began to offer VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">A such practice indicates that the government's intention to block content to block content and might have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will be avoided by this way that the censurment decisions can be met behind closed doors, thereby ensuring the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using it before court to go against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question is: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day report on newspapers in Brazil with desperate headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of various postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "14-year-old killed in school," "" "Every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "thieves were killed by military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Air Force in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a clamped financial situation, the European Union in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice called even to access the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So the news published for the detailed report on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16th, the editorial article "This is not normal," in which it announced, a new section called "war in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crime, which happen in any major city on the world as murder, robbery, sexual violence, etc. everything that happens from the civilised standard and what only in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio" (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to close our eyes as journalists in front of the atrocities.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war brik in a country which didn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper stated that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories, which are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, also, atrocities of the police, who only shoots and then ask questions, too.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend war based on information and fight against corruption at the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Would the name "war" more than they used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist in CecÃ­lia Oliveira to record the violence as "war". this is their opinion after a justification of the failed security policy through the media and might make it easier, responsible for the police on account.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as Extra in the analysis of the militarily rate in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, lightenment and a historical and self-feit negligible of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2778">No these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we watch the Mordraten one in the state, Rio is at No. 16, "writes them.</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition, extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company South America, emphasises like CecÃ­lia, has repeated the security policy of the State since years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these safety policy measures also belonged to the founding of UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia, ficadora), one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose goal was to conquer a Favela by a massive police charge and a unit permanently stationed there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At the beginning this resulted in a decrease of forced deaths. for some years the UPP has been able to protect many reports about shikans and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the neo-affecting police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux from one of his article from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention on the basis of "civil war".</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the state, funds and ways that are typical for war. this belongs to the territory of an "enemy," which is a sharp point in the landscape and for the object for "collateral damages" and "missed balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her, fact that the inhabitants of the Favela in Rio remains to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police reclaim up the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho, in order to avenge the death of a policemen.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence, this incident has also made headlines: a fruit goat died as a result of the police who fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>
