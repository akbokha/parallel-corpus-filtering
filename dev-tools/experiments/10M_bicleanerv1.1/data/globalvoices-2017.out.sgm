<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is exceptionally large.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American films, I have read American music, American authors and sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a serious effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When he was 14-year-old I saw the magnificent Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-Magnets, who wanted to occupy its interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "It was it as if it is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my irrigation had only been strengthened for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said," "" "America is the only land where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you can always be that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of equal human beings." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very bad love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the tourist group and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with its Engines.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds his opinion behind the mountain as one says so nice.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he think, as a former colleague, it declared, and declared publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes which he won by the republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this biguotto person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not know Trump and his voters with the people in harmony I had learned about my time in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, people from around the world, a deep stunning man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, Trumps also illustrates the fact that by Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," agreed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intoleranz is also reflected in the contrast to the generosity that I fought with Sandy Bahr, who struggles with Sandy Bahr, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits them to the engagement of Kristi Kappes that helped me with much patience and suffering from my colleagues, to get to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser council helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those caused by them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump pushed his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offer me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The conflict with the idea that people voted for trump, because they have distributed either his racism and fanatiism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, I broke out almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the trump-voters as rassists to record.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people are classified, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficially and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which are the most white, for Trump, because they would like to rewin the control of a country that she disaped?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "". "as much as" "" "rejection of the White Against all other Ethnic" ""; "word from white to play on the White and whiplash, what so much means Schleudertrauma), as it was the big Van Jones, exactly what was so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Million people around the world estimate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you can always have, America is definitely welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his President, twice the son of a Kenianer, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America this promise and says: to hell with frequent, religious freedom and all the concept of Pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all that I think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with human rights.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The amount answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"have Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who do not so is like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an impressive and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan joined the words: "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was rejected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his Son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaian city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played on both places is not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby precolossical ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La Banda de Música (Musikbande) has been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments an opportunity for overcoming poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students have become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is located in one of the poorest provinces Mexicos, is known for its drugs misuse and the banker violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth so a rare hopes.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dust roads to go to their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the turbullet you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timgos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero playing the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically on the largest garbage dump of Asunción, in the capital - on instruments which are made of recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments made from local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling was started under the direction of Favio Chávez in order to transform parts of the dimension in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, Celli, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayische and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez recalls a local economist and musical teachers of the children of Cateura, at the beginning of time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no space for samples and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them are not together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something, which he had never seen before: one out of waste was produced.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a complete orchestra that plays on instruments of recovered material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation of "Landmark Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landmark Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from garbage to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already been run in liquic waters of illegal fish before it was looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were brought in accordingly to this kind and inclined, a transgressors of this kind to its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing bed.</seg>

<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was sold out of the waters of the region: it wasn't able to catch him there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging of fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices and resources protects, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegally (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven out the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "so we have eight countries to work together and work together, where it comes to illegal fishing industry," "" "Tony Long, Head of Pew Charging Trusts Project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by the definition: what is being caught, is hidden because it is extremely difficult for it. the illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the clear contempt of existing laws, of which certain living rooms and types are being protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems will harm the delicates balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But during the actions against the illegal fishing hurrifisheries, the actions were curated by bureaucratic hurdles, with the information between individual countries, so the actions are in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange for example lists existing licenses, news to suspects activities or details that you have noticed during a port spectrum or experienced.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships even very attentive when they move on the open lake, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables to mark the authorities to know ships, who discover in forbidden areas - about those who summits that a ship invites its frozen fish to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In ideals, such investigations show whether the ships have a fishing license where they were travelling, and possibly even if they have a criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are denied against illegal fishing. what means that the ships may not be sold in their ports. what means that the ships could not sell their charge. and that they could even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about significant financial losses for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishing catch is financially worthwhile no longer." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to reach "" "" says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen, penetrate in Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish, which moves around the world in commercial fishing industry from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among others, actions include as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing papers, indication of phantasienamen, fishing protected species and fish in conservation areas.</seg>

<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. "and just this legale Schlupfloch tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It was criminating networks uncovered that the counterfeit licences had been distributed in Tanzania. there were ships that used several fraudulent identities and found burning ships and found.</seg>

<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO who also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships overturn their automatic identification systems, where they can no longer be used by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information levels. it should help FISH-i help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>

<seg id="143">Ships who had previously exploited without license and hardly with consequences, we know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since then fishing boats are buying more licenses.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, a Argentinean message page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father, the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine town of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a growing man, Quijano said in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes examined, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not find his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">It started with the same name as his father to bear the same name as his father to the brutal military roperations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He held his family secrets for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a feasmagent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years you do not know that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, folds and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressed, due to kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities, who had experienced a boy in the course of the years before the Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent over his child, and like this child chosen for himself a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me at the military base, I often went with us into the sports hall. there I had made me with a boy, the martial sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and urged me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active language of the target language - something that is in the native language of the case. generally, the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the language language - native language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French mother tongue should translate from English to French in French - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ a collaborating with English as mother tongue to justify translations into English. this may be lacking to lack of understanding, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers, the Japanese language.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees, have translations are firing internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best one to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and enchanted phrases which arise by machine translation, show that this technique can still replace any human translators. this is true for several languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangely English forbation in Japan, including the avengage-prints, often uses T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylious reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry nor acceptable or at least harmless. but by major companies or from the government that have to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, venezolan Internet users found that they had no access to the online transmitter Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other user wrote that the Internet access by VPITV and El Capitolio TV are not accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels performed recordings of the protests in Caracas, organised by oppositional groups, which the Nicolás Maduros government contradicated.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection should be connected, and receive the username, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites are again locked again.</seg>

<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay in veneers with Internet access is popular, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been on the reporting of protests since 2014. at that time the Commission intended for telecommunications them with money and closing when they continued to report on demonstrations by the Commission as a "Call to Violence."</seg>

<seg id="403">Amazing that the still remains cheaper than two litres of Limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsintro confirmed this later that not only Vivoplay by a blocking of the domain name system (DNS) is unaccessible, but also two more online channels. this also applies to the website that transfers their sessions to the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research institute of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research Group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers can sometimes use DNS. this is a technique that answer the DNS server requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS server, the server is incorrect or refusing the request for such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elongoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third switched channel, the transfer was stopped on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV-Camera ann Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas, was taken in prison.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was defeated, while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">After eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government is regulated by the government's Internet connections, thereby the Venzolanians will always be worth access to multi media coverage over the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a large family with little money over their minors son or her minors daughter to another, rich family. in the thousch the child will receive food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, however, it is not mentioned that the children can afford innumerable days, which will never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that in the context of an agreement that you can not raise up.</seg>
<seg id="425">As a Criadazgo practice, this practice is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by major parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - gathered testimony, calculating and paired.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things under the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is imputed to Crime is guaranteed generally in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," Alvarenga explains.</seg>
<seg id="430">Since then, the family, having their daughter in the faith that they improve their apprenticeship in society, improve their position in society and giving something out of itself, to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand the family stands that the girl takes up and its exploitation with faith justifies that she would have a chance that would not receive any training, and perhaps even starved.</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita in the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">Thus they had to share the time so that you still remained time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">It was standing every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Friday, they purified the refrigerator, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and the infected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">Ever they were finished with the learning, the more leisure had her.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay, changes from Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently ordered a bill to "regulating social networks as regards the use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When it is accepted by Parliament, user will need to register social media in Egypt in order to register social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that was asked to use civil servants and citizens to share social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of assumption of the Act, users need to register with their right names and number of staff numbers to allow social networks to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it should be missed, this might be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six sections and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video files and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is taken if it is accepted, as the draft does not assume that the Egyptian government is not able to register as the Egyptian government is currently not in the location that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary committee and conveyer of the Legislative Decree, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and a password to come by the firewall, the Facebook blocks. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a firewall at national level around Facebook. due to them it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on the network to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts in front of the place are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the previous day.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technological (in German "executive research)") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, German "Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights"), explained Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I have strong in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they are forcibly on physical public and private rooms, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it, then it means that it may apply a powerful monitoring system to apply for citizens or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of mankind and also to provide a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically no more realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of Parliament and the constituencies before it goes to the plenary session.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and decomposition will be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in whose sense is to maximized and ensured that no variance scration has been present on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy struck a Legislative Decree against Cyber-Crime, which was intended to be found guilty on a lifelong sentence for those who are found guilty to threatening "public order" and "to protest to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq work the animal protection of Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the intellectual Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of leopard leopards, which are occupied by Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are always found because of Wilderei, loss and fragment of their living space, as they always find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining noise in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the thrive of the ecosystem also depends on that a large room is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to watch a Persian leopard in mind is small and goes against zero. when the team set in the video, it shows that they have a great cat in the camera, breaks Raza in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologin shows Raza passionate about another side of their country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">The IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and focuses on that protected areas for wild animals in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimplico, the progress made for the northeast of Japan, were to rebuild the life of those in the last six years. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima lost the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimplico newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi prefecture, in the prefecture of Miyagi, the prefecture in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring ovectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had vanished from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even though the prefecture of Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, that it was therefore almost 160 000 inhabitants left their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimplico shows the progress made in local view which have been achieved six years later to rebuild the life of the area.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese revival authority as well as the survey findings of the subject itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimplico newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (air.,, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the greatest success among the three prefectures, Miyagi, where 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima happened with 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Although well, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfswald (Fed, kasetsu juutaku) was also involved in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, almost 80 000 people saw forced to live in containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 more than 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such buildings.</seg>
<seg id="557">In 2011, nearly 40 percent of Fukushima still live in notices, while Miyagi was successful in notices; more than 75 percent of evacuated evacuated after the Desaster were surrounded by final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimplico Newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the misfortune, its doors will be open until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now again in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have been restored in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, have moved to the three prefectures agricultural land large-scale in Mitpassionate.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a sequence of nuclear power is, because only 690 hectares of about 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima, are located in the nuclear zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered immediately, but also here Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same stand as before the misfortune. Fukushima can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimplico newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it has more difficult to earn their lives.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total image, the newspaper led numerous evidence among the local population and under the evacuated population and among the evacuated buildings, as their indignation had changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In the introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimplico Newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimplico led a survey by more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the oral-resident population have taken measures to be prepared to future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in disasters prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuated from prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="576">In their issue to the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimplico newspaper has turned their attention to the location of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience only the mighty earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear war, who had to experience Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people were evacuated out of Fukushima in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima in permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their native prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuated areas are most of the evacuated companies that are still in Behelfswald, older than 50 years old. it is necessary to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. here, it is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">If people meet people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences were first to be bigger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while, we often know that one more combines the first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important to demand our perspectives to expand our perspectives and remember that the world eventually ultimately became very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we handle topics that often earn less attention when they earn less attention.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember at a moment in which she felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Torah Camarasa is thinking about the time where she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 years was delivered to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer had defeated him in Goiânia with an impact on the head. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus that rapidly spread across Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures also the face of the police officer, which was identified with an impact force. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio had been suspended until the completion of the investigation by the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer, as he beats in Goiânia with his impact on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">Would be a police officer of a demonstrators, and on the intensive care station, his face would be seen for six months in television and the entire suppression would be justified with that.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneural ador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, divided by Luiz da Luz recorded video on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitation shortly to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from a different perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the lower clip you see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to remain in Goiânia during the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for more violent attacks against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experienced a wave of political power: here, the activity was assassinated Guilherme Irish from his father, because he was attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked at the intensive care unit, after he was attacked by a policemen who struck him with an impact on the face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police grips</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to protest against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, rubberrade and Tränengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">S Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), the police asked to renounce violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media street protests are tualised by giving the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window of window.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported specifically over a shredded glass windows to design their cover pages with a picture.</seg>
<seg id="621">On contrast, the O globo preferred one title story with a fire in fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken window of over the thousands of people who serve the defense of a special issue.</seg>
<seg id="623">This also must recognise if you are striped against any form of nondamage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Also here, the term "Vandalism," an absurd, distinctive significance, and the typical violence of the military police are caused by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Forms of Entindustralization Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories included the doors to Cuba (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Gregorian community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, who is located in the Western Cuban Province of Mayabeque, is widely known as a Central - on Spanish sugar mill, known that there is no significant sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were laid down in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the proceeds, the sugar cane industry continued in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the rumors of steel and concrete remained left.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be reinvent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commutes daily to the factories which are still mapped.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldier veteran, who is open every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are again in the east of the region of sugar cane factories which are back in operation after a long time period, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he did not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds exactly what belongs to that Mañalich would get the sugar tube factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resists the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market price, the Ineffefficiency, the poor conditions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production of 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive on some decades a motive for the country, but the bad inthia are no reproductive.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar pipe industry?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the congregation saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The crushing of the sugar cane industry was an economical necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories which amounted to 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugars plants and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased before about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Landscape subject" from the OECD and FAO, the Economic and Nutrition organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's Day will go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">The process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full case for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same thing happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich am May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier, is known about the closure of the factory, is the word that he is most repeated, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents have the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">So that the place is preserved, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters started to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially recognized documents that only regarding the parts, which would be removed, the address at and the date are distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the ministers able to recover any discretion.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters were more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for two years for the shut up factory and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money in operation yet in operation.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another complex, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the breastplate of the factory, in whose construction he helped, involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part that he removed, he dismantled in one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workstations was removed out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for work stations and services, which were generated in the municipalities in which they were created, were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the former president in the eyes of the present people saw when he was guaranteed that the factories had no longer work for the areas of their factories for five years.</seg>

<seg id="672">Since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by mice.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the Gregorian community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things will change, but not always to better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar tube factory closed, or better, when they began, they listened, they listened to asphalt road, this also listened to other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production is not used for the supply of the community.</seg>

<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is increasing that the young participation in our conversations as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable," or whatever is happening in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where teenagers are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the British Columbia province, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Winevago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo is told in the territory of the Kitsumkalum First nation in British Columbia, for example the history of Highway 16, also called Highway of tears, "a street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>

<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people have not always rule over the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation recorded the refrain on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people received a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop Group, which gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookside of N'we Jinan, the Stanzhe is available in the address, as well as a translation into English that is translated into English here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in- and foreign media on the infamous "struggle against drug trading" in Mexico, the vermissts and the slain are regularly indicated in statistics. however, these are not the extent of human tragedy that reflect this battle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of Drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartridge, urged the stories of victims of conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, there is hardly any man looking to the sadness or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each surrounds, behind each bone structure in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trading"), giving this victims a voice and stories of people who were in the fight between the prosecution of prosecutions and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organizational crime cannot be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are a lot of profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and all municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear of life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father that seeketh every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, that was only one day her father, her four brothers and her husband and two of her nephew lost.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have put forward to get rid of the graves, after the people who have loved us to seek."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in a electrode in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13th he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"" "on October 15th he was back again, but he never returned." "" "Emma Veleta:" "" "it is very difficult for me, for I am now with three children who need an apprenticeship." ""</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who also is with me here.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You will be the insurance of my father, but he gets not paying her, because they require a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we must show the international community the conflicts to reveal the crunning and prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central almexiko.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution is reminiscent of us that you should never consider violence as normal, in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have already know disease and Sensational journalism now for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come over every day on newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with pictures, which actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only one, that is wiped or sad. it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be even valid or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year-old cousin think that he is great. and it is not normal that people hear about the "helper" of the offenders "when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, that, when would they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who have fear, that they would also happen to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are to be naked figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The facts of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were present. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to speak that they are spared from such a tragedy if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. of Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four Months in the Capital of Capital: like a family with drillings." it describes it as armed crime month for month money from their business, until they had not just destroyed the business but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never goes, the trauma remains high, when you are afraid, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">Each other we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She graduated in the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want to be arrested that the others are arrested, because they do not know when they will lead you or kill.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if they would not solve my deepened feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence in generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he throws questions on such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexican?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other young boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he himself had to bring himself like an egg coiled, potatoes and warm, and "Chichi" for babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left Bone - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that ended his childhood.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody bodies of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a predestiny car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence through the organized crime and fight against themselves with the existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder, according to the number of people to government security and government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor counted 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of thousands of thousands stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" project, "" "" Aprila Vivir Con El Narco "" "" has called "" "" AprilCon El Narco "" "," whose goal is to set the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading, which has changed the country in the last four decades, in a wise manner.

<seg id="819">But how is the years that has been dipped for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether or untrue, tend to stand further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used irremotely used to clarify the tragedy that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it throws questions about messages to News.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, there was a tanker on the place of Sange in the East of DR Congo, tiled and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa had been neglected for years, and thus devastated the streets in the region were full of impact resistance, which were difficult to run.</seg>
<seg id="827">The tankers fell victim to the tanker.</seg>
<seg id="828">The government representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinemas in the vicinity, which was full of people who illustrate the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses roasted and soaked lees were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.added photos of the precaution form the gray scenes from this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It displays rows of stolen body, which can be found on the ground while they watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here is the story not their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo had been abandoned several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but they didn't think that in the context of the tragedy, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the fighters of the Boko Haram on the enteous nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Augenzeugen reported drastically of atrocities, before whom they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and bodies were burnt in streets and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massaced.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "the numbers could not be confirmed but" "" "no one stayed back to count leaks," "" "said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were raped, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only based on satellite images the follow-time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unexplained but the army point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the trial of the Boko Haram, country to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo was back, as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misused use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of missibility; Africa Check has been documenting orders to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for massacres.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments such as this example, the picture from the DR Congo will be related to the mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The pliers also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who could flee strokes, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by violence against the Rohingya reported, Posts like the following on which these descriptions made with photos from the DR Congo brought together:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken by a Saudi-Arab news page that claimed 2012, the President Myanmars Tha being told, monks and politician could have been involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition they had used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrated this information.</seg>

<seg id="860">Traces of these false coupling dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually far from anywhere around the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "converted picture-search" you can see how far information limits can be exceeded.</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames, which go through this post. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence of Christians by Muslims, or to defense of Muslims - the exhortation of Rohingyas in Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how a African life is given in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with this effort.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is, but what happens if reading this images cannot be longer belief.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are only people who have unintended to treat the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugars the mood of missilently and falsehood that the actual atrocities are untrue and tastes the real estate of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination images was already debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the retention of pictures of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that forcible pictures readers and spectators will take away the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, seeking to help others like forcible media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot of forcible representations in the media media, is fact that they are indispensable for today's news report.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they will thoroughly reprove the situation in which a picture has slightly sugars, which actually can be used by the context or completely misused species.</seg>

<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the number of stories in their original language a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unmistakable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get to get the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Indeed, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to the born children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the plan of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we are cities that have not forgotten - safe spaces in which inhabitants are not forgotten to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "often it is often associated to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "the listeners to appreciate, to feel to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format story of history images first put your story in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional history, they lead its devotion and their representation that the audiences will be on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotion when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The subsequent video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the history of history Rassidatou consate also the opportunity to clarify the number of typical customs of art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fabel of hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having asked the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience, which does not understand your language?" with a wide atrocities he divides his feeling of the content:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project, can organize with TLS in contact to organise their own story performances.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organizations involved in a mass demonstration; the march started at the puertorial Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the Gruppente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda "(civil front for the neural examination of debt) and the National Assembly of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercrankings of the debt of debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is your demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos calls for the responsibility of the politicians and government agencies that are responsible for debts to responsibility for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We require a financial examination and an Steering Committee without personal interests to public debts, with a firm, our working conditions, corresponding to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refused to pay a debt that is not her.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not take place with sinking's retirement.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the territory of an integrated territorial area of the United States - suffers under a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Center for New Economy," a governmental independent non-profit organization without party belonging to socioeconomic development, a law to state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed on the outside, without the participation and conviction of the citizen, to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration took the name "night watch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian Webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives have continued to continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has made an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: PUBLICA, the annual conference on digital culture, which is aligned to Berlin, dedicated to the event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, an scientist at Book Sprints, a publisher by the so-called 'Book sprints' finished books within three to five days, lases out of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inner (The cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published in the last year and is licensed here, contains a series of essays that employ themselves with free culture within the face of the repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would explain how movements for free knowledge are being built and what the true costs are connected to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activist, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, involved in movements for free knowledge, have been working on page to look over the fog, which gives our Newsfeeds to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of Adra-prisons, in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about his present state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that want to release on his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, has many of us begin to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given in this process of temporally extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution which was transferred to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer in Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel reported on the basis of one of the" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented himself as a Insider of the Assad government and they were drawn by an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his residence and condition remain ununknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia played a decisive role in which access to the Internet and to know the knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently overlap of the leaders of New Palmyra, a project which established Bassel writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was none of bass's cultural prototypes, as the work that he started to reconstruct with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilian populations and the Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesful traditions and personic influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after being started with this work, the IS would have everything that architecture, not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world embodies.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip is created into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of unestimated value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">In front of this project, Bassel could not close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom to dream and Bassel taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English good.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has always shared his knowledge with every one who asked. he has taught English to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other inmates how they use computers, at least theoretically, without that they were actually one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a provocation that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She tasted the lyrics, when she visited him, and translated them out of the Arab in English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It is happening on every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sinks in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the owner in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers doesn't matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, armchairs and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prisons of the prisons</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I'll be in every detail of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I can carry my passion with me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes say Lebeg</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I read another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return rapidly to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep over your absence, and to smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I'm talking about myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel wrote Ghazi:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes, my soul</seg>

<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of Monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bass's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the regime Bashar al-Assads, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) more than 65,000 people disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence through the regime, were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1253">We repeat this demand in hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption-part director after disclaimer again</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambience reacted with anger on a corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state of State, in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is where Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants because of illegal dispersion from 54 million Metical (approximately 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was taken from public funds from Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and called immediately his reinstances in the company, which happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a position of the General Attorney of the Republic, which received the application, there was no obstacle for Cambaza, where the company had no discipline procedure after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution which was responsible for public transparency, sentenced in an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to introduce the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and interpreted the absence of transparency and is even a return to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know that the company should have a discipline procedure against the contradipping process.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company is apparent, however, and do not have appropriate legal steps to use the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique of social media, rejects this behaviour as well as "resistible":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent case, he would be consultant after having been sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them have taken half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep talks and motivating words, he could be advised and his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has insufficient to be reintegrated into the company which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is expected to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambiers and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he could not believe him, that one would have rewarded someone in such a way that the state has already claimed massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the moral to return and to serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only himself served as the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used the state, when handele had become an inexhaustible money source and the state itself, this man was tired, who was pre-loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte preferred to remind the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel will not only stay in memory for ever as the first independent President in memory, but also as a sharp, cutting-cutting and by side - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he confirmed that "an ambitious man was able to be able to sell his own individual interest to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if a ambition man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is a criminal case. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also aboutdated:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he sat 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today it sets him the company, in which he has been unable to betray the money, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - will be readily available. (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo by the magazine @ Verdade (dt: @ truth) states that crime is paying in Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racial word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burmesan word "Kalar pae" means Kichererbse or Spaged se.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the famous social network took their Posts from the net because they had the word 'Kalar' abstained.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although on the origin of the word, it is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to humans East Indian origin or generally used as an adjectively. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook licensed the word" "" "Kalar" "" "(in burmesan lettering) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hasselt in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascension of radically national movements has given an extreme abonnotation to the Word.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as Hasselt to Muslims who represent a minority in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight Hasselt in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensureous content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "would usually be brought together with Racism, but the word reminiseth not automatically from Hasselt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that they have reviewed or doubts in which they have discussed the use of the word or doubts for his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are several burmesan words with basic different meanings that have the same accounting sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written to Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', what the same letter contains, such as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spaging), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboognutzer Aung Kaat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, whether they could feel like his back pain when he made his back pain.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence KU la - "Cure" (KU) + the Frageword (la) on Burmese - resembles the assistant expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hills is the opinion that they should reduce the radical nationalists, but also said that Facebook analytic must be to spread out all posts that seem to spread out in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook deletes the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filming the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should be done instead, the post is carefully selected to analyze and check it by sending the words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spoils).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dreckily nationalists spread out to Hasselt, a quite good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is at the time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action would like to send a strong signal to all, the Hassle language may not be able to keep the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship's cervical networks are often used to start social networks, a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to press their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaung Myat was described as Facebook began to quit his post when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar's word is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I became the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post "Facebook Community standards are not deceased."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posters removed from people who have no negative intentions, or that simply try to show her opinions against Hasselt's radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, nothing to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassle speak from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, author declared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are poorly in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more than the beginning of the initiative, for example the burmesan Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a prosperous intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words will be censored only even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems to have been forbidden without any local context or technical support, such as "chair" or "peas" or "peas."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they did not have errors, they tried to report the posterior postage.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If you would have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that a huge turnover would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has ensured a lot of fun under users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of being erned, users are now funny on Facebook and write the word "Kalar" not in the context of Hasselt, to see whether their postal address will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that had no Hasselt, but nevertheless they were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmesan Text is "I want to sit on a chair and can watch the peas and a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try out whether Facebook is the post, which contains the Word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious findings are used to have social networks to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt in social networks have to use violence in the municipalities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where conflict between Muslims and Buddhisten have forced thousands of escape to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been responsible for his conviction that they would speak to his burmese parties under control, criticised.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just reading the word 'Kalar', it would have better working better than in context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the parliament of the country unanimously approved a law, which is supposed to offer such practice, so that the age of age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of marriage, some members were duistical and muslistic religions in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leaders of the various religious groups of the country gathered, that the state should not mix together, since that the state should not enter the maturity of maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened uncounted the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting partner of the UN's rights, the minority is defined as people, every man under 18 years. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">The UN's statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had already been married at 15, in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8,1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Central Central Office of the country confirmed that 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media moves to contest the laws of the children, followed by the feet, followed by great support. undoubtedly, they helped them to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless not all are smooth.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-guide, for example had no concerns to say the critics of the children of children, they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was actually uncomplicated for tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and sometime there were doubts, whether the opposition would agree at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But early in 2017, the bill was decided against the children before - despite the 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would do him to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country have to vote and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators gave a Status update, which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against Child before was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided in the Senate, the draft can now be used for the law.</seg>

<seg id="1375">However, a possible hook comes in the form of satellite Maharaj, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu Organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">In the months of months, Maharaj announced his intention to pursue the judicial steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney in Paris Al rawi, a discoloration of the law said, it was quite right when Maharaj would like to proceed against the law, most of the social media users would wish to say the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell now struck:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we say, instead of the discussion so general, in a way that we would have to talk the state in our sleeping room, simply that they may need of big, persistent, men who are opposite to the advantage, would be misused, would you be ready to continue discussion on the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it comes to a judicial action against the law, or not, these legislation is an important step - but there are still places on the world where the children is legal in different gradations or to the norm, although there are laws to tell them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the United States, represented internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since more than one month now the popular and on the Crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV-series weaving against the locking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used, Internet users are used to use streamlined websites (a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey did not fall the third largest VPN prevalent in the world), most unusual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been published by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently in a published report of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, will find regular blockings of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it goes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continue to remain closed, there are several Mirrorpages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) as the platform all of the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine calculator links), which does not support the system of domain name and thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is readily available despite legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything that snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents, even if you can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step has been carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it only deals with screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli of Wikimedia, Italy has both tr.vikiansiknock.org, a Mirror page of Wikipedia, as well as the Mirror, an open source project that everyone can use, to hoist similar Mirrorsites, when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consuni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and collaborator with Mozilla in the Panigrahi's open "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You go to another URL that is not the original. that's what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">The server is essentially leading to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This contribution was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally issued on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of an Content Sharing Convention again.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care, the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use a Pronomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chesisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect to the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of consequences, they should dismisate the norm to life this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state Oosta by a spotted court and destroyed by her family and the village community after she had talked with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also did not call her name, it is also common among men. however, they have seen far less assignments if at all, they should not occur in this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including healthcare personnel and household women, a unique club and were thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they discuss the hostesses of the Patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # Khelbadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and is designed for the reduction of the Patriarchate community.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's heats up to the annexation of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and heads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It is reported that these clubs have created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time at the end of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini shown in their discussion round, did not call women who did not call her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided for this subject, because she wanted to open the interview about the Patriarchate with a problem, which makes women easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">According to the names of their husbands, it is a bridge that they have not guilty of any liability and never put in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't keep it, will be regarded as back as a woman without moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have made us up to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who has never been named her husband, has never been named at home at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned back to me, and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self confidence in the Bagini, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" ever before. some believed that it was a good cause, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different poems - happy, offended, sad, lovingly, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they may call us how they want, that they may not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day to whom she brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women will never talk the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that it was only afraid of the whole exercise, and another decided to relocate the whole frustration against him and his family by completing it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was static.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the apdrenalinlet about that they have broken with an ancient rib, the women decided that they would actually try to call her husband to name their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas put them in the head: his wife couldn't stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-mother in law she was afraid, she got afraid, and said that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in case was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported that women have attempted to stop other practices, such as the trays of the cinoma red point on the forehead, which shows the Eheststatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinnored point when he had it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I heard that I was able to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose it even in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make the women who could hear what could hear, "says she.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; they danced and spoke about things that they had never made thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, as well as our identities are linked to our husbands, never so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things according to say, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we are talking about the concept of glory and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, the okay, but some wanted to have a saline cta, a wide shirt over a trousers, they did not be dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the excerpts of your own hangers, the Moral is connected to the saris and much more, tasty Rohini her own couple Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure to make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion club has been changed, Rohini confirmed that the things are slow to roll:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps to date.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened to her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me are still, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women have now carry on any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the line to navigate more freedom of movement or own hanger - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, it will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change anything.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman goes home to home and other people, what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We sit all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>

<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations were first continued in December last year. in June Norway signed an agreement to record the salmon left to China, since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message was widespread that Liu was serious, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release of the expression and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be stupid as an independent state since Singapore has been recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam was to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at a meeting of the international bigs of the State Chamber of State of New York, the minister, that many people saw the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because it was compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He understands that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has put in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, whereby most people go an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we may be different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a land.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to make "logic" to defend the existing authorised exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and essays to create this valuable country, you hear that we were not any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibility, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my land, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons of Shanmugam led reasons were not very Nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of which, he appeared insoften.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically democratically elected.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the Themas, the good old lyre of the authoritarian Machthabers will be back to be able to abandon the Democrats, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final effect the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests concerning our press, our Judithative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant issues tarry with non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam on his opinion, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit rather difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is no country, but a city is, so in which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful when our new K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point if it was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog of his comment, he points on the critics that you should start to read the whole text of the conference in order to understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore is a city, and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" as a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore are so unnecessary, even if we are looking for free and righteous elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He spent Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he doesn't know it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugam, who makes a leader of a heretofore-growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I'm talking about what was said to the Minister of Justice in Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old yarn that I expected to do with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it is really associated and is aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review distorted the weaknesses of Shanmugams:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "committed a mistake" or was it a Freudscher?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a land, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country walk the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government sector, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam is serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do I afford their military service to defend their own city, but did not defend their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizen of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Then, the German magazine Journey of a Decade to the evidence, Singapore is always a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have a lot of chess more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "defense of the country above all" etc., but that's not quite correct.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak rather from the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez runs a small hotel in Tapachula, at the State of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican female, a small woman with a corals-pink brilliant and gold colored earrings in teddy form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This top name is the fact that the hotel (or rather it has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with grinding, abumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells us the people in full small bushes and from the upper part of the coast to call her: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time it is rather quiet but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject it.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they bought them medications that they cannot pay to them, they massage them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable top name for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghostal) posiums with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to come to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel that it fits to her, because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the heart of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels to Boston with his sister, who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are in the United States to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other Wegener from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a Guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Afrikaner often travel together the route and that the Africans speak already on WhatsApp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of its captivity, Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa since months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to get the bus terminal to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact us in the future with Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never go back," "" "reply he smiling." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells that her guests often send text messages when they went to grate them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps well known here, but it is not the only radio hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, Sackgasse leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family took part in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policemen and has found that the Bustickets are sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," says he. "I have experienced what they can experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his working place.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted money back to have a plan without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked after an accommodation and a unknown, one of all, has offered her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives there and attempts to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the course you can consult the traveler quietness their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy about that her house is filled, but it's also nostalgisch because of them that went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, they cut them in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hairpin, which you did a Kundin, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install on their mobile phones to install a surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Check-point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang from Twitter user.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi was able to install a cell notification where it shows the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the notification it is said that the app will be able to obtain access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kònate the authorities to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia were arrested 10 Kazakh women in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police, that the app will determine the sources and the distribution ways of the terrorists and prosecute, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, from online fraud, and Phishing pages to make user attentive to users how much time they spend online, and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This App with the filters for minors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these functions can be used in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hacker is able to manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications of digital censorship in China mostly concentrated on the experience of users in the East and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, opaque ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit the unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures, as well as routinely internet management.</seg>
<seg id="1976">That is based on Twitter-based media Outlet "Images from the Fair China" (FEST), published in China, showed photos from a Checkpoint, on the policemen the residents are immediately checked if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you have discovered a Checkpoint with one device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a retreat for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use devices that are intended for older people to use.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the transfer technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back again in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" China "(50-acre), also released a Jingwang-product description, that the software is able to raise the code requirement of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the hard disk of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and cellphones are in Xinjiang to electronic manuals.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city party Council, minimize the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government officials, authorities and associated institutions including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report from Freedom House, an US-American Human Rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, until August 1, their "personal ID cards, phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media-storage cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obvious to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy them. this promotion does not violate the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep myself again, let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours walked, which came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to dawn.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I am answer with the voice of one exhausted young people:" "" "my lord, my father has to make a terrible worries." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The jordanic Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigar in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text, recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib brings the most of his time into the inside; it divides his screen to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can rely on, a cigar can discover between his fingers or to discover his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top creatures of his family house which had heard them since 1967; the year, in the Israel his occupation of the West Bank finished and Hdaibs family had forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where they had lived as fellowyees (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Since now, Hdaib is a passionate activist, who was transferred to the conservative majority of the conservative majority of gender reels, sexuality and free expression of expression by art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With its music, often marked with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he calls not only in his hometown Amman Relevance, but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a man that is not restricted by the borders, and he can feel free according to its own statement by the people who have to suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he is not open, he is a special disruptions for the US Foreign Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas where he was born in Jordan, even though he was born in Jordan, even though he had never been born in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think of my own life circumstances," "" "emphasises Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then adds: "I think so because I'm a man, while He dissolved the nest-café in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise until sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan illegally.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has a senseless Junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle we speak the mud of the warm coffee and the swaden of the Kent cigarette case in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you cast a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it simply avoids to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan Water - to cross it in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliaments that support the Islamic State Court - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country is contradicated and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the sinner.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim in addition, the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be hazardous activism, which demonstrates the old legitimacy of authorized regime in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila became the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of Human Rights," which continues to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to move the rhetoric, but actually an evident-crystalline reality reflected in Jordan that occurs in Hdaibs plant clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional gender standards sent to the body by making his vision of the fate of Arab women, which have vodesichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a obviously unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who have actually confidence.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of 'honorary morde' has increased - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch the number of Honor of Honour in 2016 reached its peak; however, Jordan was missing, the institutional infrastructure is missing to support women, the victims tried murder or domestic violence to support appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to decline in 1954, women who are subjected to the danger of a family-family force, "and for their release is often a longing bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs music is looking forward to great popularity and is well known to remotely in his country as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib states that his work is politically, but dreamed that he's his music that is full of explicitly related to sexuality, freedom and expression of expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "he said," "" "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed", Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "ghareeb" "" "is focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically politically, can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market that you can get in his words, "that one can get what you want" - be faith or non-faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan over the rights of sponges and lesbians, and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals still have been put into force until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordanic online program Roya, to notice later his comments from the context of the context, and his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded uploaded, but was only a revised version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance of homosexuality did not say to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuevo, a poet of the eighth century, who still has stayed in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuevo was going to work once again in the order of the calibre, in the eighth century, why Jordi could not write it?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion and that progressive voices will be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news services ordered several former government representatives and members of the teachers of teaching, with the grounds, they would have been criticized on comments in social media, which contradicated with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this is the Hdaib's opinion, only the tip of the ice - the actual challenge is to have a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent enter and take place in a row for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it looks like Hdaib - it consists of slow, need and inactive changes. it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society will take place.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreams not only to bring his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region's help of music, art and literature of a real and basic activity, and not through bombs, streak, and artificial kind of running democratic. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far, hdaib will continue forging and therefore also afford resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a version of the Tanabata festival, which was also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory shows that the drums, drums and dancing over a thousand years have been delivered from the west of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi near the knee.</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to Guerillakage</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the Beitrags "Liebesmessage of Guerillacclaimed," which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This contribution will be published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel out out, affection to meet?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went on the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation Bogotart and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation's Young Youth Foundation (Letters to Reconciliation), young people to encourage young people to write Guerillacquires letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Just before short, her country was a historical event, and they wanted to contribute their part: after a long negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International applied for the signing of the peace agreement as well as important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Colombia, there is still a long way until you can speak of true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric, and around the clock continued to integrate their weapons into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society turn into the life in constant fear, and in some cases deepened hatred against guerillings, these now have to be taken into their ranks, and support them to the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young column should join themselves together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages to former Guerillacclaimed to welcome them again in the society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former Guerillaries who should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the man that we love to write on the Valentine's Day of love letters, but those forget that they need a lot of necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told him to share his love with people who needed the most urgent commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So, the plan, letters of hope and support for the former fighters of the FARC, which now will find their place in society and to create a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a war history about a common history of peace." they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2000 letters were collected in the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogotart reists to store the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were so on how they had done earlier, to meet the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of undertakeover of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all parties. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between me and all that is between, and the political science student Betty Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had delivered the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of Guerilla comfighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambook" (a kind of cottage in which the Guerillacclaimed) saw it, I saw a guerilliterate that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid, because in addition to him there was a MGL-pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the village of Dornavy.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "hello, what do they just?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone has written me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone wrote something so nice, so do I answer it. "and suddenly there went on tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him entirely, and set me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry that he was sorry, all the years of the faithful companion of this fighting would help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never joined the life as a war. the FARC was the only opportunity to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society without waiting for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how I have to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rule, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and some of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as a war, and the FARC had already been in secret places.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC history explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process: "for many years, we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help us to create society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for an objective of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people, who had not yet found hearing and had no electoral law, and to know that people who often have seen as monsters, and even had learned people with beautiful poultry who were turned through their life and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, do me hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But comfort me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage caused by us to bring us something like a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian column was made that after defoal peace would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons and to protest their rights. and this is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We now set the FARC now on peace, on a policy without arms.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology, they belong to all the people that dream by a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution, and bring sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those who defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are coming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grozy who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about us what currently happens in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ law in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines after several months after reports were published, killing torture and killing queer men in the Republic of thematised.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaja Gaseta, and she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, suspected quefied quefied men and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transition, was born in Grozabad and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Already since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was grown up, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safer place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chetians had learned about the sex, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">From fear of her life, she moved to the USA last year.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helferin with a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwife that was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone made a friend of my documents, and spread them everywhere in the internet, with my phone number and a picture from me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there is no men in Chechnya that can eliminate these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">Then the photos of my documents made by all WhatsApp round the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I had just returned a couple of shopping mashed out of the seat of my car, I heard a male imme: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned back, I felt anything in my body, but I did not hurt me.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and the final end of the hospital in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken everything and began to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had a nurse.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two samples in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in whom nurse were you laid - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name's name; but the physician stood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time on his office, I got it with fear; it was a muscular, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has gone fully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats in the last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightfall.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The desired, send me to Chechnya, to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They exhibited absurd demands: some told me that I would have to prove it up through the streets; others wanted to say that I had not changed my family in the official TV in Grozy, and that I had not changed my sex, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have Körbchensize C - what would I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to move with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family but the whole Republic has damaged."</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not touch you because you are a profitable wife, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she felt a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I went into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with dark window discs and a numbering plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My right-right friends tested the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give her name, but I want to remember them all remember; they really have helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without sign, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived at and checkte into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe in safety, only because you have forsaken the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know, in which hotel you prefer. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about the sex, but this is a table topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish to be able to overcome this seelic barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we chased with camera, I really give me trouble as the person reminiscent of their past, thus reminiscent of my male shape.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current location in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who had to eat one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that Ramadan had no man arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan did not wait, and he completed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So, my I, they probably invite you to contact the problem with the affected person and at the end, a evidence that the so-called "glory" has experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still pregnant men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says, there wouldn't be many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"" "" "" "if, in particular, those who have no rich relatives or dropped from their relatives to imagine Kadyrows court." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so you can present them as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be converted to show her body in television and claim that they would have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not just missing, but also dipped specifically to radicalize.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a delay or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just returned someone who was imprisoned in Argun in a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after all of you had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, these person was taken away as these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">But until now they were not presented as bandits, in addition there were no reports yet, but we are not possible that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else should I not allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and performances of people who have a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I have always married my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozy, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia had been considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safe as now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to introduce ourselves to" "" "civilian" "" "in Russia, however, he finally cast us into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia Act?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were boiled; I had coloured lashes, wore Röhrenjeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Scharia never has a hair curved.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozabad there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met as me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and all the city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never besieged.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spare not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often says to children, if the sick people are fun.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes before you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended, never chased and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long kept this gifts time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not over us by se, but above the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who was angry, and laughed at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily slowed.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from which I am still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicated with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize Teetreffs, together, I wish to get them to the hospital and help them to get the essence of essence.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't forget any cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered this people when I fluke a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I'm Muslima and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is allied.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is the nature that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetians who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no weakening with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Those who have so far, the Cabardiner have those who have Russians also, on the entire planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is impossible to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque, and during the Ramadan keys - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many thinking about transidentaries to men who love men and believe that you have to do his family to make more intime experience. but that's a Truginal connection.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensitivity to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed to my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I personally become so personally, but my last intime relationship is now longer than one year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">Iranian Ahwaz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty level within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase of self-moral.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under Angstresses, depression, and emitted himself for his own help, the ability to come up for his family, Ahwazi-Human Rights Groups who want to work in Ahwaz and anonymous.</seg>

<seg id="2404">Some people created it fast to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only self-committed suicide in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists warns that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights told that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: there were all family väter who, due to the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless, and uncapable of forced their families to nourish and safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is located in the majority of Iran's living Arabian Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahwaz was a mainly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power over and 1925 to finish the ethnic autonomy of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In Ahwaz region there are some of the greatest in Iran's coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most powerful and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continued only slowly, and the local population gets only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused Twazi-Arabs systematic jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are to lead.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These demme have led only to destroy the devastation in the region through drying, and local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-youngsters increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for Kooperative, work and social welfare, applied that 5% of Ahwazis, who completed a work school, has completed 55% of secondary school and 45% a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" systematic strategy... "to destroy the Spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, leads to a" high rise in the number of suicide among the young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since Functional and institutions are non-Arab labor force, the local Arab Ahwazi is able to have access to the local Arab Ahwazi access to all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which abstained to destroy the Spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to make them to earn their lives outside of their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be tolerated, since even Arabic names are not tolerated in the workplace, because the speaking of the Arab language or the traverse of Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to carry out human rights activists before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains unwait, whether the world will wake up and being aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am no feminist, react many women - especially white women who draw themselves as an internal feminists - with frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even use well-thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be any feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under controversial observation, if it goes on what they are doing with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women socks earlier or later in various fields of life to a smooth blanket, and that discrimination is still across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come on skin colour, on racism, on Black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community, or on black women in the LGBTIQ community, or on black women in the LGBTIQ-Community or on a black women in the LGBTIQ community; if I'm interested in which type we were physically, seelically and verbal. if I chose to keep many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, however, all women, that women - all women - together should come together to sing "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing" to sing the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that it is in addition to sexual violence a institutions form rassistically motivated violence that we are exposed black women to two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or in fact, black women and women of other ethnicities and country homes less earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migrant background more often the school is rejected as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women suffer from a higher risk to suffer from a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want to join all the women, all men and all the people every man. on the other hand, I can't connect to a movement in whose center the white woman is refused to take into account the iniquities of their thinking as well as on the skin colour of one person.</seg>

<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which is also absorbed by cultural demands of our customs and customs, to describe their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try out of white women the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honour one better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the Intergovernmental Feminism was founded in order to give women of different interest, and abstained by white feminism, is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I'm going to join me full and entirely of feminism, who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of myself for a white feminist paradigm, which is so tough that intersectional phenomenon is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Although some white and internal feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, please inform you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>

<seg id="2487">If women want to display at all once, they do not receive assistance by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men which they do misuse. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to admit the victims of violence to report to the prosecution of criminal authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women really missilently, says Myrian González, a social scientific research facility in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that they do not have to show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, there were over 70% of them in case of domestic violence. at 70% it went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace. 86% of the ads were recorded here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically missilently, 55% of women spoke of mental missions.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics show not the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayian women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these offenders are actually indicated. "on every woman who are reimbursed in Paraguay for mental missions, come 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who are reimbursed for physical abuse, two women who do not do this, declared it at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an independent criminal cases, the prosecution of prosecutions may not be adequately documented, such as many women each year of their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but two years, they carried out the psychic violence against women, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would like to be victims of missions.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read earlier about it, I thought that only women happens to undergo, because they are ignorant of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that it would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the failure by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described their interests and different attacks during their two-year relationship, and told them how he had insulated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorisch whether he has ever raised the hand against them, and refused to stand out that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen the so long of Carlos, and left him not earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of missions had at least a certain fellow school.</seg>

<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of missions.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with others on their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything began with mental action.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner succeeded it even to convince them that she was valuable.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias displays the authorities without a result and also by their relatives, she received no support.</seg>

<seg id="2533">The original bill had provided the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process that they have to bear the victims of violence at present, if they just want to receive an indication and secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not require sufficient financial resources for this purpose:</seg>

<seg id="2546">"this website has been closed due to a decision of the information Minister" is to read on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago the oman authorities have closed the independent Arabic newspaper Azamn because of their coverage in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, remains in prison, where he had a one-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari, and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and executed before the court.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, after he returned to power, after he had set his father, Said ibn Taimur.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the principal offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, President of the Supreme Council, and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of the Sultans is characterized by the hardening efforts of security forces, in particular by domestic services, including freedom of freedom, limitations and human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hints citizens, also activists, to make their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn newspaper, its closure and inviting three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) was reported until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chefredakter of Azamn, formally published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016, after taking corruption in the Justice "title, it went to corruption in the judicial authorities and the mixture of high-level officials.</seg>

<seg id="2564">The Tribunal sentenced three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted among others because of disturbance of the public order, "abuse of the internet" and "subexcavation of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of violation of a audience of publication and found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj was sentenced to three years of adhesion and penalties in the amount of 3000 oman Rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after having found the use of a information network for spreading material that could be found guilty on the public order.</seg>

<seg id="2570">In a hearing on 26 December 2016, Al Abri said to a hearing on 26 December 2016, Al-Haj sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on April 10, 2017, after the outpouring of his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he had banned his own sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court decided to close the decision of the Ministry of Information on the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the Court, Azamn again, the newspaper looks back like attacks by the oman government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January the information minister issued an order, which was extended by the closing of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Federal Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and, with which the ministers issued a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The last closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at recent times the press freedom was injured.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, for example, the closure of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on albalad, the first independent online newspaper in the country, to stop its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the closing time of Azamn and the detention of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the oman authorities are still not ready to prepare a significant violation of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Center for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the oman authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately release and unconditional;</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the required medical research on site, there are two reasons: for a look at the global health system many medications and vaccines that cover the special medical demand on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and Malaria have a great problem in the poorest countries of Africa as elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases by Pharmafirmen are a great problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, when producing their own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can be eligible for economic growth in continental Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first grazing impact on national health.</seg>

<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed over the future of medical research in Zambia and over misunderstanding of the media about these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as private people).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit warer RW: at the moment of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic National Program for antiretroviral Therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion according to the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only have solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will remain the receiver instead of myself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, often can not be used in our surroundings, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is necessary to special scientific training, starting in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploring the space, health care (non-transferable and increasing diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa opposite Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often are the limited speed, things to do, and the measured access to scientific expertise that click here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), limited also the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producer the global food production change</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredness, the first plant which has been cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton work was given only by its own insistence and the question as many salatons he can set limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more salads were patented and that it was not able to use them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more such patents have been registered to more plants such as cereal or cartographers. due to this trends the plant breeding, environmental protection and experts for nutrition security in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still need lettuce, it takes no longer because his work is still worth more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when I lie in a river a rock, around whom I must paddling.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we must now make it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents are going to go to Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if it is standing before the court, no one can find out a new salad, because all the features are already patented. "he makes so good as possible and tried to recover those features, which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, however, it is very careful and hard to use no material that is protected as spirituality.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that will always be bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have red Roman lettuce of the sorting outlet in the "greenhouses" of the station and eaten. it is tested that plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name is rather so sounds when the movement are from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software to inspire alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and genic are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently used for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, briefly Ossi, U.S. breeders could undertake that others can use them-free seed-free seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "Open Source" -breeders allow only others to breaches their seed, and it is not immediate - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Whispered prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerge professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility to breathe new plants, both important for nutrition security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds owe him a role in larger cohesion such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or just little to use seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified, or not, from ecological agriculture, or not. "to know our goal of ecological agriculture, such as it is offered on farms, such as farm markets, should also know that the way is bred, as such vegetables is bred, threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereign without seed accumularity is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to make other their seed is still available to provide. thus, their approach is to be patented in contrast, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supports argued that the future of food supply is endangered, since the available genpool is always available on plant material, which is therefore always restricted, undisturbances.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in their doctoral thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability. they found out that approximately one-third of all cartoning features are protected as spirituality, which is either not usable for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby means that massaged plants as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visitor</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they have targeted features - of such as their taste or their color improves up to such, due to them in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, since the changed conditions are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesman Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four Genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the company set itself a conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it says the view that spirituality is other breeders, since "patents and protection of plant varied innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan that can follow, as soon as the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection is inhibits so innovations, but promotes them to be provided by the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the differently: 20 years to wait until a patent has never done no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long on plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have already lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general good and it should remain still to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetely incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate farmers their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That's it that drives us, and it will be impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton on the concept is to be patenting, plant characteristics: "we are not creating the features really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it even as breeders, we finally did no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breaches a sorting, also chastened its own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Who believes on industrial agriculture with large courts and monocultures may be needed for the cultivation of herbicides in its cultivation of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is right exactly. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto have) patents, creating most smaller seed companies, even without any patents or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant maker Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo of Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by the Avoid of plant patrons: "it looks like that I have been producing my efforts to produce new products, stronger than businesses.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors are able to sell my varieties in a few years, "says he." with a patent one man makes it very nice for 20 years. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" to be leading to the concept, however, quickly spread across the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which himself describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources, is a "open-source" seed programme. for receiving the seed of traditional plants, the center with farmers, and helps them to breathe new varieties to fulfil the specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed well and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agreed at an "Open Source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's obligation to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to land, which cannot be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission explains that the conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent, the patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet a law; now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend for use seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "Open Source" seed systems explains that the organization is currently distributing a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official start.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit organization USC Canada, and concentration Group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Eerosion, Technology and Concentration) has been compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed-good map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essens, and other - a report published. it represents the view that farmers have to come to seed and improve their seed policy to ensure a stable supply with food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seed well for sustainable food systems - a connection to by the Luby Ossi hopes that more people will see him soon.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has mostly cultivated, where and how a bit is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "Luby." "" "we are trying to clear the people that even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt, as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network released a statement on Facebook, where it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The FNetwork for Human Rights Information Stay in spite of this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution would still defend a voice as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical options have been depleted to overcome and do not follow these targets to overcome and do not return. we hope to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities started more than two months 21 websites, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post, and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera.</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of web sites to the victim. @ anhri had one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the column and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for spreading and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, whom he established in order to handle the Censuration of the Egyptian government, itself the goal of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, which is home to the provider of Ziadas blog, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other side.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces as he reported on the student protests and recorded a video like the police of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article turn mainly for politics and human rights conditions in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada turned to the plainment through the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to give me the feeling of a siege against me; an arrest, a supremise murder, incident at national Security Council, recharge blogs, as well as any other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, although only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him, and that they may have fear of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mule go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed on 24 May to 06 August 133 web pages. this was technical tests in the network of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by the direction of online and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12 June, we started how the blocking of websites that VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of government to block the government to block content and filters to the Egyptian users might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation, in addition, the situation will be worsened, that the Egyptian population has no legal basis behind the Egyptian population, which can proceed against this actions before the court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the Chefredacter of the newspaper, that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure is:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a warrubrik in a country that doesn't know the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist announced that it is according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories that will be controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">It is aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to understand atrocities of the police, which only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name "War" more than they used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist in Cecília Oliveira against it, the violence as "war." this is their opinion according to a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to attract responsibility at the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - as an extra on the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, lightenment and a historical and self-counterpart of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban known for their hatred on Hazara well came closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara forsook the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape took Asharaf in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">A few years he worked in a cohabrube. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then, he took up what was left out of his low pay, and went into Iran. again he was once again in a foreign country with other refugees and towing bags with mortars, the heavier than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, like today, life Afghan refugees was influenced by missiles and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard, reminded in an interview with Global Voices." we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon from the open window, that we do not play at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">At the dangerous override on the sea, he suffered ship and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Agroaf homeless, ran only by the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church who distributed twice a day of food.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of chance for past asylum seekers, but it's true that the conditions to find asylum seekers in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2900">According to Italian Law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a recording center if you have officially put an application for asylum - what can still go for months after the registration of the asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for a accomodation, either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was Agroaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his indiscriminate life of life helped Asharaf to release soon from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several work in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf had his entire saving in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so well that he opened a second hostel after a while, and a snapshot was opened.</seg>

<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
