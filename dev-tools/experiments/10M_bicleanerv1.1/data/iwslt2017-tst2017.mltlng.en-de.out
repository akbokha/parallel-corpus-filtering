this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him , because he won as a New York Times repor@@ ter for the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before someone had heard from Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen a book written in which he was spectacular that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally heard of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic U.S. intelligence service in which the CIA literally called for a atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know that the chapter was not pleased ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government was determined against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became the symbol of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and journalists to discuss journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media cannot get these information , and if they do not protect the identity of the mu@@ le that they are cheaper .
so , when the government of R@@ isen , he did something that many bra@@ ve Repor@@ ter already did before him : he refused , and he said that he would prefer to go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived so with the risk to go to prison .
but then , only days before the process , something unusual .
suddenly , although they were many times that it would have been indisp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the claims of the government were dropped to r@@ isen .
the reason : in the time electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ter and sources can always hide less .
instead of fail@@ ing and rust to bring statements , it could also be able to do with its digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so , the investigations , without his in@@ compreh@@ ension , wor@@ ried about his own telephone ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its lending service , and even travel instructions with list of flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ cks .
unfortunately , it is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ell . but instead , the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary has more convicted than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem especially because the government is too much of their work as secret .
since the 11th of September , almost every article about National Security was the outcome of what a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ell went to a journalist .
so we set the press work on the game that will be protected by the first constitu@@ tional@@ ity , because the government has always has more possibilities to maintain all .
but as the technology of the government permits to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and although they can take it from the moment , in which they can contact , instead of the follow @-@ in , in the testimony .
today , there are communication software that has not yet been written as R@@ isen his book , and it is much more safe as normal emails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous , which was developed by us from the previous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been developed .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send documents , as in any ordinary contact form .
these will be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the relevant News Agency .
so , the government cannot explain any more information secretly , and many of the information that would like to request would be not available in advance .
Secure@@ Drop is just a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are always new sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ et@@ technologies that are all end@@ anger@@ ed .
it is necessary to ensure that not only technology managers such as Edward Snow@@ den has a possibility to do ab@@ at@@ as . it is the same that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to know about abuse during the supply of soldiers and over@@ filled hospitals . or to the next environmental workers , the alarm to the sigh@@ ing water of Fl@@ int . or a gel@@ street @-@ Insider which war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
at all these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of the story was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; was hidden that the rich and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; have been hidden by Global Wit@@ ness to a declaration . &#93; this week we were talking about an L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax .
we will receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do it ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister is back .
there are also reports that an associate of brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad brie@@ f@@ en@@ firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
it claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin takes over a narrow friend of children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , waiting for the next publication , and to the next un@@ ched documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems weeping away from you , ordinary people .
why should we use what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty in the location are able to store your fortune in tax phases and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these abst@@ entions are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret control phases of some few , their fortune to hide and swal@@ low -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and un@@ veil for ten years .
I think many people appear very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is difficult to understand how these control phases work .
I always look like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe in front of me .
so one has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer .
it can really be difficult for criminal prosecution and tax agencies , as well as for journalists or civil society .
I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably , because there have been no known American Americans that came to this sc@@ and@@ al .
well , it is not so that there is no rich Americans who hide your fortune in tax phases .
but through the principle , after which these control phases work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have links to the United States .
in fact , it is so that you need to specify less information in some US states to form a company than to get a library document .
this species of in@@ transparent in the US has allowed employees to capture school children .
it has allowed actu@@ ator , particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior which affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investigations were as an African minister , who wanted to bring susp@@ ects money into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all up to an advoc@@ ate of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer@@ ing his money .
these were all occurr@@ ences . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to the money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as a single slope .
it is not about a single lawyer , who under@@ stand@@ eth investig@@ ator suggestions .
it is not about a single top pole , wrapped in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it &apos;s how the system works through the corruption , control cur@@ rant , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to handle this , we must change the game rules .
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
I like anything very tr@@ end@@ anger@@ ed , as if we could do anything against it ; as if nothing ever had changed , it is always the rich and mighty one .
but as a recovered optimal , I see that a lot has to change too .
in the last few years , we have seen how to read more transparency about the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US has left back here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this makes not the progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Cont@@ ents , this huge insight into the world of the tax is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
we need exec@@ u@@ tives in business to stand and say : &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and to do it , through laws this type of in@@ transparent .
together we can finish the in@@ transparent , which now allows this type of control cur@@ ses , corruption and money la@@ under@@ wear , finally finish .
this is the story , as I had almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk room of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ stage sale .
a type in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked on my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and made a road journey through the whole country . thereafter he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made him to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleep now ?
but I just knew him ! he says he would not go to peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I &apos;m not kidn@@ apped in the boot room of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot space !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
night I was in bed , I star@@ red to the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken up ?
a wild@@ land sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on ti@@ ff @-@ pointed to the door , and my bedroom door has closed .
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had bought from me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my eye @-@ angle completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered on it ?
people on my air mattress was to accommodate myself , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
do we make a short jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates and the rent will be increased .
I knew that there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think , creativity can make it to transform and transform into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I heard how we could earn something like this . our apartment is coming to a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WiFi and a desk , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air@@ matt@@ resses on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure to taste our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et , completely different because we made them for our guests .
we stayed with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , star@@ ed Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rental ?
things came to roll .
my former co @-@ inhabitants , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to figure out how to make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly shown images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , the kind of rooms , whose doors is coming when visiting .
on the Internet , they can invite our foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile was kindled .
but did it not do .
no one , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that is not allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned all , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can see on things that can be good . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to develop objects , but now we wanted to create through design , which never before .
can design be so something ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample sample , which are the degree of confidence .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your compilation .
thum@@ bs up , when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I like to make your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock mobile phone your left seating .
this silent flight of pan@@ ic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what the host will open when she opened the first time .
for the only thing that is your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locking mobile phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so most of the guests feel that they may stay differently .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
so , who has now actually Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you declare on Twitter for the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we would have changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have been presented only once with his name ; if he had told , where he comes , how his dog or his children will be called ?
imagine , you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments that they all say : &quot; he can really un@@ lock mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you want to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ established feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to drop negative reference departments .
ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had to be submitted , before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we performed with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined , as probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are similar to the age and residential location .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly we trust the people most , who are similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social Vo@@ re@@ ingen@@ u@@ ity .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes .
but it has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation of the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep root pre@@ ferences .
Moreover , we drove that trust depends on how much one of them is cheaper .
here you see the response to the first news of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re talking about little , like &quot; Hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get any answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too much , as for example : &quot; I have trouble with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted .
so there is an optimal degree in Op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olls of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design to produce this degree ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which you should write anything .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages compared to strangers .
as we had not counted , the great amount of people who were more than ready to have this pre@@ conception .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredible good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand that was not covered before .
the shop is very good for us .
of course , there are times , if not all the smooth running .
there were guests who are allowed to celebrate parties or apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it does already hurt when I think only .
the dis@@ appoint@@ ments that hear@@ ings in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , was and always our greatest motivation to improve us .
fortunately , a fra@@ ction of 123 million people had only a fra@@ ction of a problem .
for people trusted in one another .
if confidence works , it can be wonderful .
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to cardi@@ ac activities because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real protective gel that save lives , although they don &apos;t know it .
you ride a car in the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel at that time , they bring books over . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights .
I only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , of course , it does not run every stay .
but these relations behind pure banknotes are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy .
when I was proud of this term , I asked me :
how does the idea of the sub@@ sid@@ y fit together with money actions ?
it is a economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s just called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is not just to be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people create a part of themselves , and that changes all .
if one travels nowadays , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what would you be to express a rich buffet from local currency ?
what if at any place you visit to wait a group there , would have a thoroughly re@@ plen@@ ish and to show a bas@@ eline quarter , of which one has never heard ;
or if you can learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed in privacy after the principle of privacy .
what would we be , if we would like to make apartments of the ground ?
how would this look like ?
what would happen if cities would have the shared share ?
I spend some cities that allow us society and relations took place , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ cel@@ ery .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , this project has already begun . many parking lots , which belonged to the government ,
they were now offered themselves . students who were looking for a lead in search of a lead ,
were killed by people whose children were taken out . were incub@@ ator programmes started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , there are 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries to be guest at a stranger or even hosts .
the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why does it work ?
in addition to luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep parts .
I think that bl@@ ossom ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Maz@@ da passes over me .
we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself what we can use it soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a believers ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ under@@ wear a brain under@@ wear ?
or just a delay while security holes at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .
so we represent the media that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage above Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans are mine , most would not know any Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never learned a Muslims : it is great , you know .
I say you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ powered -- double Esp@@ res@@ so , with whi@@ pped cream extra .
I am di@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ al@@ thi@@ eg@@ s @-@ Fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims min .
but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , for , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to have decided .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ched me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslims min . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friendship was horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ y was : at that time it was for me a femin@@ ist independence of Independence , and over the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt me to adapt me a perfect and integrity .
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the Quran .
I read it , thought , thought in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ en with each reading of the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me to weeping .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that someone takes you really under@@ stands , and yet somehow loves ?
so it feels like .
later I married and began as all of the good Egyptians , my career as engineering in engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen in my kitchen , looked at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ crafts in buildings , people sp@@ ouses from the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned fast in indig@@ nation .
why should you do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; broken Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only attacked my country , but in the N@@ u turned me the works of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to go through the U.S. West to the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate course .
I remember how I was silent -- as we were silent - so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims for the first time .
we moved in this night into our apartment , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , when I heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations which said : &quot; be careful , &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead you not in well @-@ illuminated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gathered to gather together .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were pru@@ d@@ ingly unusual and I heard of attacks on Muslims , or of people who stayed for Muslims , in the Free and defeated .
there was really Bran@@ ch on Mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something feeling not felt right .
because people who attacked this land have attacked our land .
I got the rage of the people to the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain to themselves .
I have nothing about questions , I love questions .
there are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is just the question : we are mal@@ icious or sp@@ icious ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ch@@ ant tumor was just under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are as all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ oni@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques of America make secure ?
there may be a couple of parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant , and larger civil participation .
and as a head of the police in the Washington region , DC recently told : people will not be radic@@ alised in Mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ ated in their cell@@ ars or bed before a computer .
when the Radi@@ cal process has found that it starts online . as the first , the person is cut off from their family , so that the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the terror@@ ists shall be true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ates their behaviour and ide@@ ology .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to keep people to go to the mosque .
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS had its brood with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslims , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would be able to add to us into their suburbs , if you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS have so much to do so much with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you cast a look at them , they don &apos;t drive what they are in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their breeding ality that they can read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding im@@ am told me a amazing story :
a girl came to him , because it was the place to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit that had spoken to silence , she brought her to silence , and told her that her wrath was for un@@ righteousness in the world , they would only bring it into trouble .
from nothing inspired and something that had given the sense of their rage , she was a major destination for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who spoke a solution .
this Im@@ am presented the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ use for their rage , he showed her constru@@ ctive way for a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mosque , keep it before the IS .
that was an insight like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it work on every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy , on our idea ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts studies -- show : if we fear we will happen at least three things .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and pre@@ conception .
a study shows : if one reports test individuals who have been reported negative in Muslims , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only one academic problem .
if you look when the tuning of Muslims went up with Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the preparation of the war of Iraq and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction on Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to man@@ ipulation public to identify the foundation of a free society that sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we perhaps feel it as first , but the toxic air of fear sh@@ es us all .
for the assignment of collective debt , it is not just to declare themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental Faculty , talented , promising a lot of ...
his sister would say to me that he was the ad@@ est , a most generous man , whom she knew .
she visited him there , and he showed her his life . she was bl@@ ossom and said :
&quot; when is such a di@@ versi@@ fied young man made of my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne during her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was born in the afternoon as soon as he was post@@ pon@@ ed against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism cannot be only un@@ mor@@ al@@ ish but also dead@@ ly .
so back to the start .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
we had no light decision , for it was not a light decision because we would like to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in whom we can freely prac@@ tise our religion free .
we decided to build us for the mosque .
with our son in the kinder@@ garten we drove silent , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I looked to keep myself .
the hall was filled rest@@ less .
then , the Im@@ medi@@ ator made an announcement , and called our guests welcome , for half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ eist@@ s , believers , and non @-@ believers who were come , not to attack us , but to stand us .
at that moment I am broken .
these people were there , because they had been courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and Fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you go to number safe ?
or you will connect to those that are : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a Ner@@ v .
but I wonder what do you say that you might claim a T@@ ED@@ Talk to work a monument with dr@@ au@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t know . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look to Muslims on all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted research on all over the world , people want to be normal things .
they want to go well for the family , they want to work and want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people appear as a rule , the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ers , just before to become a one billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial thre@@ ats . this is possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air @-@ package in our social awareness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft engines in the Fra@@ c Centre has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with them .
by connecting gear units high speed and acceleration on the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ adhesive structures .
you have learned to carry loads , to deal with tur@@ bul@@ ences and to react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of Pos@@ sible Flight .
this means a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it has to know collective pra@@ ises where space objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic t@@ issues .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alis@@ ing technology by Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest E@@ ben@@ e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight machine tries to beat two flying with a fl@@ ap .
like other starters , it is efficient in the back@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most powerful cases it can be sulph@@ ur , and it has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a mit@@ er page .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ ons is that they react sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ences such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn &apos;t matter in which location the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved through practice .
okay .
during our research we often provide basic abstract questions regarding the core of the cause .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
Hel@@ icop@@ ters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts , which collec@@ ts themselves to viol@@ ate you .
prior to decades , the pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled flight devices that had only two movable parts : a propeller and a hed@@ ge@@ ons .
recently , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented recently .
it only has an event@@ ful part , a propeller ,
no sounds , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further positions or controllers , only one propeller .
although there is mechanically simple but happens in the inner life very much , that it can be stable and can easily move in the space .
nevertheless , it does not have an elegant algorithm of the stern . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability to throw it right , if all look on , is low , that &apos;s why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in com@@ b@@ ulation , this machine is here if the head@@ phone with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is equivalent in its orientation .
in this way , he gets the au@@ dul@@ ent skill skill ,
in all directions in all directions , it doesn &apos;t matter what direction he is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is visible in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly to flying .
let us see this .
if you want to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ propeller aircraft engines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a little bit @-@ called -- a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even though .
we will demonstrate this that we make a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic schi@@ p .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit is white , where in the space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as it would like to be a flying lamp screen on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of these technology .
for types like us the reward in the development and the process of work .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it is creative , sc@@ oop creatures allowed to form it in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the bag is on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes are always faster , you walk to the mass of three n@@ uns in a ten@@ ths of pure energy .
this short moment they ligh@@ tens her brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the universe .
it was a very big Kn@@ all .
but their energy did not expos@@ e their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time poems and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events initially temporarily .
at 1.3 billion years ago , multilingual life was created on earth .
since then , the earth has under@@ gone a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God understand us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of very bra@@ ve -- R@@ ai Weiss decided by MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about colon@@ ized black holes .
most held it for crazy .
but enough people knew it as a mad gen@@ ies , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry @-@ Observatory .
in the following time the precision of L@@ IG@@ O was significantly increased , which improved the detection performance .
therefore you call him Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
in early September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run by some smaller , persistent problems to clari@@ fy .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ fied black holes through the Earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye to my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically , the fruits of my life was .
all this , what I had worked for me is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and collective Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . it has been investigated for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their ob@@ servat@@ ories such as L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a forces in the face of space and time .
at the front of the wave , the space and its entire contents will be stretched into one direction and the other .
for illustration , Do@@ z@@ ers perform a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance in Kur@@ sen for Rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stret@@ chy and dust , stret@@ chy and dust . &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even sm@@ iling .
on the 14th of September , for example , everyone was stretched out by us when the waves of the waves and the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the Kom@@ ma , followed by a 1 . therefore , the L@@ IG@@ O employees explained for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer @-@ long laser detector , and this is already ab@@ sur@@ d , it would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a radius of a nuclear power . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on grav@@ itation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , hunting after the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are mighty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cist are fin@@ alist and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claimed , L@@ IG@@ O is more an ear than one eye .
I want to declare what means that .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us : fac@@ ars , the size of your mobile phones .
that &apos;s quite convenient . for so , you can get a picture or a map of things to take advantage of several points for you .
with tones is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce an image of things that mean you particularly much :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and volume , rhythm and volume to close to the history behind .
&quot; now Alice &quot; says .
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob &quot; .
the same is true for Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t have any simple pictures of objects in all .
but having regard to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to us their stories .
at least the measured frequencies are at least for L@@ IG@@ O .
when we convert wave pattern to sound , we can listen to all literally .
the grav@@ itation is to listen to us about coll@@ ision of two black holes so my colleague Scott has already been busy .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , Zir@@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of motion set , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that I never forget to hear -- heard L@@ IG@@ O the following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ der Sp@@ usch &#93; , knows this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass which are about as fast as the bars of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : superior to us what means that .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 rop@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 tons , revol@@ ve each one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it , because we have heard it .
this is the lasting meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O eb@@ net a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the All and listen to the invisible .
much in all we can not see -- practically or generally -- .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why the same stars explo@@ de super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned much about all of them .
however , the exciting physical benefits are done in the core , which is behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . the ur@@ gn@@ ment : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe but we will never see since the ur@@ gn@@ ment is covered by its own neigh@@ bor .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible until the beginning .
and the most important : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we never see , which we never see , and of whom we don &apos;t have any idea . things we are just to discover by listening to us .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found equal in the first attack things we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like L@@ IG@@ O they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ y for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us to have a completely different angles on the events of all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as good as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ servat@@ ories -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servat@@ ories on Earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than the ur@@ ine ?
now the time of great dreams come .
dreams with us .
thank you .
some time I tried a experiment .
one year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I feared .
no matter whether it was nerv@@ ous to tell me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes . &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start playing with the play ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , and fear my fears .
my fears to keep words , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , who changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly art . it began with a question of my Klein@@ sts .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the Klein@@ ste , calls for un@@ explained reasons , &quot;
as it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need milk for my s@@ um@@ bil@@ ical &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her , when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from here I swear to play always with them as soon as you &apos;re going to do with them . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I always say Yes -- each individual times .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I should meet me very much .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only before short , I actually knew that the &quot; Yes &quot; would be saved to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think of things you prefer to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create television . I create television .
I &apos;m doing TV , in large style .
in this TV season , I &apos;m responsible for that 70 hours of programme into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time .
each con@@ sign@@ ment provides hundreds of jobs that previously existed before .
the budget for a television channel can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode of nine days , four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programmes , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , the same time in production are four episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With The Cat@@ ch , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in the Americas my TV series run on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series will run in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments that I have created themselves , and not only produced , so still ob@@ sol@@ ving , creative time to gather my fans to camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , which burn around the world .
do you know who still does it ?
no one , why am I a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you are doing so hard , if you say a company , a land or a household , you can understand that I don &apos;t want to understand that I am not only about the computer , and it is true if I say : I understand that there is not a dream job .
everything is a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened to work , there is no other feeling .
my work is always a country out of nothing .
it is , when I set up troops , I painted on a canvas .
as a dre@@ aming man a high sound , lie@@ ve a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is creative , mechanically , an@@ str@@ en@@ ous and de@@ pri@@ ved , clinical and matern@@ al , clin@@ ically and sen@@ su@@ al , fierce and sen@@ sible . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when working is good .
one sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows , and it grows , and the sum@@ s list@@ ens like a busy street , I could always go for ever .
many people participate if I declare to them the sum@@ s that I &apos;m talking about that the writing is preparing to me .
do not understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- as I started working with the TV production when I began to work and to work , to create and merge , I discovered this thing to create this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t beat any other than the size .
the feeling , not unlike size , no matter how to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps there is also a Work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for the failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s .
I want to tell you , I am a titanium , and I know that I will not ask it in question .
to make a clear : ever since more information , the more bul@@ ations , more overcome borders , the more work is , the more things at the same time , the more things I see , more , I write the story so much more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more must work me .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the screen , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then stop the sum@@ s .
revised , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ om is an only work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , working weekends , no Reu@@ e , nothing to deleg@@ ate , one Titan sleeps not , gives not on , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ showing @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I didn &apos;t have fun any more .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so what makes you doing what you do , the work that you love , suddenly bl@@ am@@ ed ?
I know , some may remember : &quot; Heu@@ l you , bl@@ az@@ ing the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know what you are doing , one loves you will love one teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that gives the sum@@ s to know how to stop the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stop , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states @-@ winery in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m on the way to outside , late and she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say than me two things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say Yes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and second , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; licensed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is it happened ?
I hate it when I am Titan bin and my sum@@ s , and here all changes before my own eyes .
and so says it : &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and like their sisters , we laugh much and I read out very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum@@ s , I can do nothing but to fit .
I &apos;m focus .
I am silent .
the land , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exists , st@@ icky fingers and mo@@ ck kiss@@ es , delicate voices , watch@@ strap , and song , in which it comes to lot , or whatever the girl is in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so close that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy switch comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel that I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay at the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the wor@@ ms , which is only the replacement .
if I ask you , if I am asking you who am I , if I choose from the broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not unemployed .
it depends on pleasure .
the real sum@@ s is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the river , who comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ red the pressure of history , which to do di@@ fying tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the genuine sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child will play with me , I will tell Yes .
I &apos;m going to be fixed , so that I can rid me as a Work@@ ah@@ olic of any fault .
it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
they don &apos;t play an@@ sat@@ in , how to work .
the truth does ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to be at the workplace as at home .
this in@@ gest@@ ion is painful , for what a man is better than to be home to house ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ est , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too , is none of them .
we r@@ ases in the garden around , and back , and go back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we grin@@ d soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always looked after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play , until I ask : why have we ever heard with the games ?
you can also ! say they always yes , if your child would like to play with you .
perhaps you keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ aming .
then you have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they get something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ni@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and my teen@@ ager daughter is 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad av@@ une day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no cell phone , no laundry , no de@@ fle@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ au@@ ght !
my children are my prosper@@ ity , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul peace .
it doesn &apos;t go to games with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
for the &quot; Play@@ ing &quot; in general .
enjoy the 15 minutes !
find out what you doing well .
find it out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;ll enjoy . friends meet , books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I got up , when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to pass more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not a 15 @-@ minute walk ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my leisure time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
work not working without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door open to the energy , and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she met me and my soul . she for@@ wards me to new ideas . I use it in full bre@@ wing and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s but I love it not .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and st@@ icky finger , dinner with friends .
now , this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grat@@ eful .
it is a dream that I am a titanium . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I games , the happy are I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the more I &apos;m working .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I create , the troops , the tro@@ users , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of the sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ak , naked and new life in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think of things I bet you to life .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very small ability to help sel@@ f@@ ancy .
after a serious injury of the central nerv@@ ous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is the reason why I was functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgery ?
a doctor attemp@@ ting to improve the nerv@@ ous functions through various surgical measures .
certainly they have heard from one of the most well @-@ known , &quot; deep @-@ ir@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons that improves neu@@ rolo@@ gic function .
it is really an aston@@ ishing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson which suffered under severe trem@@ bling and heavy pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation means not Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
we approach our dream to this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with a little help the brain can help itself .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading upper physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
I often delivered patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that at skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a , the brain rel@@ ap@@ t and the cran@@ ial pressure is til@@ ted .
to save life , you need to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
it must be removed sometimes a part of the cran@@ ial mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
cells of a tissue grow to grow , comparable to all small children , which are out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biograph@@ ies that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they looked slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so , we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but felt different .
we needed long to understand whence they came .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ aller@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the F@@ öt@@ us , they take care of the brain .
but why do they get to us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of brain , since we find them in higher concentrations near brain violations .
but this is not so safe .
however , a matter is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted a piece of brain mass from non @-@ language areas and then remove the cells exactly as cul@@ tured as Jean @-@ François did
and they then mark colour@@ ing to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the edge of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in the brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they were returned after some weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells , and now the cells remained to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the proof that they show them are these little points . these are the cells that we dis@@ band@@ ed in vitro , in the culture .
here we couldn &apos;t stop of course .
help these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual loading job .
they had to take animal pellets of one tablet .
they did very well .
when they reached a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we last in the motor cor@@ tex of the hand mot@@ ori@@ ic range .
then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand more .
just as it would happen in humans , they relaxing spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic bra@@ ins . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , which re@@ lied spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can deliver about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance .
it is not so precise and not as fast .
now you see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the friction plantation .
I can tell you that were very exciting for us .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can invite you to freezing and later .
we can use them to other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still going to im@@ planted it in humans .
I really hope to show you soon as the human brain gives you to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely be sure .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are , before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : that &apos;s under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to the start of clinical trials . if you look forward to the future , how many years it takes to come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on approval of clinical trial .
will it allow us to allow the authority to launch it soon ?
then one must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you must first show that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
in the West we make a big mistake to view it as of course .
we do not see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ altered ge@@ aring .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its huge im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy in Europe van@@ ishes us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ miss@@ able that the democratic process of our country - our elections -- not affect the savings programs that have been realised in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my recorded friends who would repeat me , if the democracy would change anything .
at this point , I want to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you to believe it with me again , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of error , we could save democracy , but we could need to save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy .
for without democracy , our companies are red , our future jets and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the subject of van@@ ishing , I would like to prove you at an interesting contra@@ diction which currently our inn are threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tw@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tw@@ ins @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and know him as the Scho@@ den@@ berg that th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Scho@@ den@@ berg ,
but few recognize his di@@ ym@@ us .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is one of un@@ used au@@ ster@@ ity and corpor@@ ations , which could have to invest there , where it would be productive and income , with whom you might produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and the Eurozone , a total of 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested , in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial facilities , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on .
3.4 trillion US dollars will sound according to a lot of money , until it is equivalent to the same time in the same country and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange rates and real estate prices .
thus , debt and productive capital form the tw@@ ins of tw@@ ins that do not mean by the usual market mechanisms of mechan@@ ics .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , such as Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who could not invest in whom they could not invest , that his son would kill him if he grow to grow ,
un@@ rolled the circumstances that lead him to kill him .
this is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; its extremely mer@@ sible Art. All the un@@ productive capital should be used to develop our life and develop particularly all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I think so . but before we proceed : what do we understand ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a social form , in which the Free and the poor is the majority of the government .
of course , the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy finished many of --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to decrease the importance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these in@@ clusions .
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they did not have the working poor , but important and crucial , which they have the right to set up the right to political participation with equal voting rights in questions of state p@@ liers .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy didn &apos;t have long kept --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is too fast .
however , our today liberal democracy would not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy focused on free citizens , and the working poor is based , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
because the liberal democracy came up only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was adjusted to politics , during the economy -- so the world of the corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ c@@ ration@@ e@@ free zone .
in our present Democrats since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ inher@@ ent fight between the two , the economy gradually emigrated to politics and dis@@ ma@@ ze them .
do you wonder why politicians are not more so far as earlier ?
it is not an Deg@@ ener@@ ation of its DNA .
it is that one can be today in the government today and yet do not believe in power because the power of politics into the economy are se@@ clu@@ ded and the areas are separated .
I chose my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about such as a flock of prey , which are so sustainable the animals , of which they feed themselves , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are hungry at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy , which grows so far from the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the concert is growing , political goods is growing , economic demand falls and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are to invest , the cash of their companies are investing .
according to the success of capitalism , &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher will be the tw@@ ins of human labour , and so much higher the waste of human rights and welfare of mankind .
if that is right , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better when the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control to control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea about 100 years ago and it was not strange good .
the doctrine from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is to recover through a miracle like in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of breeding and waste .
but there is a solution : to make the working poor !
capitalism does it to replace low @-@ wage @-@ employed by automation and robot .
the problem is , such a long economy and politics separate areas , the automation is higher , and the social conflicts can be higher , like it -- already very soon as I think - in countries such as China is coming .
so we have to combine the economy and policies to un@@ ite the economic situation and politics , so we will make sure that we will be democr@@ atically democr@@ atically elected in a heart rate monitoring Hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which can appear in the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
the question is not so whether the capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements that he has brought forth --
the most interesting question is whether to be replaced by a D@@ yst@@ opia , similar to those in &quot; Star Trek &quot; , or similar to those of the society in &quot; Star Trek &quot; , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the sense of life fr@@ aming .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what else could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ opia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the field of companies : imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital is going to take you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one has just worked -- is ownership of those who work in the company .
then all income from capital and investments are completely overhau@@ led and the concept of wage work is completely overhau@@ led .
no distinction between those who are the company belong to work , but employees who work there , but the company does not have to work there . no tau@@ rine more between capital and work , no big g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ans , and ultimately no one @-@ por@@ ous tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is tra@@ ded -- we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the respective country to a common fund .
imagine that this fund invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment charges are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically the fact that John May@@ n@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one had not the technical resources at that time .
today , in particular , we have , especially in front of the background of a restored policy and economy .
the world , which I decide to you , is more liberal , in which they preferred privileged people , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history and ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian , globally ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will awak@@ ening in such a world
or will we fall into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opy ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you will defend yourself in your biography as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything from what I have just said , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do that &apos;s technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall demand , as Larry sum@@ mers known as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by the transfer of this crisis of one part of the earth to the next , as we are currently living , it is not only our Democrats dest@@ abil@@ ize , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is definitely relevant ,
likewise as Hay@@ ek , so I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you think not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical declaration -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that told it . BG : in your presentation , Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have said clearly said what you have to keep from the view of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of it is ab@@ yss , -- the area of economy -- a totally demo@@ c@@ ration@@ e@@ free zone .
in a certain regard , if I may tell the pro@@ vocation , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ ale , as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tic that affects the democratic development .
what you can now watch in China , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China is now to do this to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious about your experiences as a financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I think that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back to the first half of months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , in fact , to say goo@@ db@@ ye to the subject of self @-@ awareness that a massive displacement line through the euro zone , and continues to continue the development of the entire European Union massi@@ vely .
we had the opportunity to go on the basis of the Greek pre@@ fecture -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion of this den@@ ying --
unfortunately it is right . unfortunately the powers are within the Eurozone , within the European group , continue to den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries an economic system that is not able to get the life through political will and auth@@ itar@@ ism , you may have any longer a while , but if the change occurs , it is ab@@ rupt and destroyed .
BG : what change you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any error in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any minister after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , claims that he didn &apos;t have any error , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was a hon@@ est interest on pages of money to find a common solution .
but this was not .
they just wanted to bring out our government , only because they wanted to deal with the agreements that ran through the euro zone .
they didn &apos;t want to stand that she has been a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
no one out of the Tro@@ ika of the money , who puts us this policy : &quot; this was a Colom@@ bian mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of convers@@ ations , you seem to be quite pretty per European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone , from som@@ eb@@ ody who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the em@@ etz@@ als will be forced to destroy and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not be cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
when we propose ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , it will also appear to me as well as for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard of Roy Price , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that met Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows , shows the shows and content to the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fighting industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any way .
he must find shows that are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are entitled to show this evaluation .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows how to make a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sort of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that &apos;s what you should say in this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle output , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they are unable to insp@@ ire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something so that why doesn &apos;t want to risk Roy Price .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he particip@@ ates many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and present them online where they can watch them free of charge .
and if Amazon exists for free things , you get too , right ?
millions of spectators look at this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team to record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you are p@@ auses , which parts is ski@@ pped or once again .
you collect millions of data to decide on these data we should produce them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , these and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ Com for four republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
do anyone knows the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show can remember , because it was not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- i.e. something about average , but not just that of what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time , another manager has a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always on the search to find this a super show and also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of a contest , he and his team will be the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , shows the shows , etc .
then they use these data to find out these small details about the audience : what shows they like what actors , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they went up a car and decided to make a Sit@@ Com over four transmitters , but a drama @-@ series on a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 review on this curve . thus exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data and experienced firms .
they connect these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision to meet you , then one should meet a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect , is good TV , or ?
if data analysis is not working , then this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time , in which we are more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond the television .
does anyone know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software . come in contact with this software , you are in prison .
if any one asks here in the US in prison and to release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release occurs or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medium television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results will not always be generated . this is not aware that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the facts are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes sometimes error .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is due to data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst species , predi@@ ctions -- due to data analysis of the Google @-@ research .
it func@@ tioned wonderful and was a great news position . the success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; .
it worked fine , year round about year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the publication of the publication in Nature &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data are missing companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand anything .
in spite of all these errors , data flows in decisions of life a -- on the workplace , in case of law , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based Genet@@ ics -- an area where some very smart people are un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . about the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and non @-@ successful decisions . this pattern should be used .
if you solve a complex problem , you do mainly do two things :
as first , put this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyse the single parts ; as a second place you set the components to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to understand a problem and understand his parts .
they are not suitable to en@@ force the parts again and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we have it all : our brain .
if there is something that is good when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is un@@ complete , in order to hold a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of a experts .
therefore , I think , was Net@@ fli@@ x as successful because they have data and understanding where they also belong to the process .
you will use data to understand their audience better , why not have been able to understand how to take all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which stood not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , making it a great risk of personal risk with this decision .
on the other , Amazon did so on the wrong way .
you use data to control all their decisions , first when they chose TV ideas , then they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they say to us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think that things are wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and in order to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions made with a j@@ a- or no question you need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will get it later with a technique demo .
I &apos;ve met some decisions in my life , whereby I should hear the ball in the night .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace these by something much trig@@ gering , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic building .
so perhaps the ball cl@@ ü@@ ger and cl@@ ü@@ ger . finally , it &apos;s thought to meet decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I can see this as a very encour@@ aging message that despite the great amount of data still paid out , decisions made to be an expert in which we do , and risks .
because at the end , it is not the data but the risks where you cross the right at the end of the curve .
thank you nice .
