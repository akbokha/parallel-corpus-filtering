this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard by Edward Snow@@ den , he wrote a book in which he had spectacular that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard by Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in it he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence operation in which the CIA was literally transferred to Iran &apos;s atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not feel the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been determined and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the government of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ res and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and protect the identity of the Mu@@ zzle that they give .
so when the government of R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ters were made before him : he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual .
suddenly , although they have been working for years , it is indisp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the requirements of the government were dropped on ra@@ isen .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can still hide themselves less .
rather than to be ashamed and to bring down statements , this also could do its digital foot@@ steps for him .
and thus , the investig@@ ator , without his understanding , concerned his telephone calls at home ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its lending information , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
in the middle of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ ori@@ ed and cra@@ ck .
sorry , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke with his appeal to protect wounds . but instead , the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary has more condemned to him than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how that a problem can be , especially because the government is too much of her work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ ori@@ ans went to a journalist .
thus , we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more possibilities to assemble all .
however , as technology of the government permits to handle the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
although they can contact them from the moment , in which they contact contact , instead of the afternoon , in the testimony .
today , there is communication software that had not yet been writing as a ra@@ isen , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source translation system for W@@ hist@@ ories , which was originally developed by us by us S@@ wart@@ z , and is now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post .
there you can instantly upload documents or send documents , as in every usual contact form .
these will then be encrypted and saved on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government cannot address more information secretly , and many of the information that would like it would be not available from before@@ hand .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments develop and develop new sp@@ y technologies for all over the world .
it &apos;s not to ensure that only technology separ@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to bring ini@@ quities . it is as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ res ,
the over abuse during the supply of soldiers who knows and reported of over@@ crow@@ ded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the sigh@@ ed water of Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ street Insider , war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data streams of the story was published . &#93; &#91; what does this week we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; this week we asked news about a che@@ que of 11 million documents in Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax @-@ phases .
we will get an impression of how customer , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you judge that ? &quot;
in fact , we see the e @-@ mails , as it works as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
the Islands Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
there is also reports that a ban on the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad with@@ ered companies in tax phases .
it claims that a track of $ 2 billion is going to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a narrow friend of children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others that wait nerv@@ ous to the next publication , and to the next un@@ veil documents .
now sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am novel .
it seems weeping far from you , me , ordinary people .
why should it be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax bun@@ ni@@ es and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these dis@@ covers are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax bun@@ ni@@ es of some few are used to hide and swal@@ lowed up -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing for ten years and un@@ veil .
I think many people will seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax bun@@ ni@@ es work .
I always present myself like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ in@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand what &apos;s behind this prayer .
it may be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I also find it interesting that there is fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans that were present in these abst@@ entions , this sc@@ and@@ al .
now it is not so that there is no enough Americans to hide their assets in tax bun@@ ni@@ es .
but by the principle of principle , after which these control bun@@ ni@@ es work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
we would have a bit of data from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that one needs to give less information in some US states to obtain a company than to get a library license .
this type of the in@@ transparent in the United States has to be admitted to school children , school children .
it is possible to allow especially vulner@@ able investors .
it is this type of behaviour that affects us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investigation into the offices of 13 offices in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers to bring the susp@@ icious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht to buy a private jet .
it really sho@@ cked that all of them went to a lawyer at our investig@@ ator proposals , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ mat@@ ch@@ ings . none of these lawyers attended us as clients , and of course there was no one to any money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as a result .
it does not go about a single lawyer who has under@@ lying investig@@ ator suggestions .
it is not responsible for a single pol@@ arity , wound in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to handle this , we have to change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this type of behavior .
this may seem very good thing , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if there is nothing ever changed , it is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I really see that a lot has started to change .
in the last few years we have seen invent@@ ories to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA remains behind .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in the two par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians , but this makes not the progress which we would like to see .
we really would like to see how these Panama abst@@ entions , this huge insight into the world of control bun@@ ni@@ es , as a means used to ensure more transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ rest companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy that are standing , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and to stop using this type of in@@ transparency .
together we can finish the in@@ transparent , which now still have this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the boot space of a red Maz@@ das landed .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a type in the red Maz@@ da stood and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he was telling me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the invoice , I made it to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just knew it only ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps but I don &apos;t know if he really is that . I don &apos;t have been kidn@@ apped in the boot space of a Maz@@ das !
that is a small trunk !
then I heard me : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to pray ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I cut off the blan@@ ket and thought , &quot; Oh my ! what have I broken up ?
a wild sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I got a fear that I got out of the bed , at a tenth to the door , and my sleep door shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he bought from me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my eye @-@ angle .
perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as a stranger , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
doing a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my fellow inhabitants attrac@@ ts and the rental is increased .
I learned that there were a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think that creativity can do it , fear of fun .
I wrote my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I guess what we could earn something . our apartment is on a designer bed @-@ and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and established such &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in wood floors .
they loved it , and we also loved .
I &apos;m sure to make sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et tast@@ es completely different because we made them for our guests .
we touring with them through the whole city . when we got our last guest and fell the door into the castle , star@@ red Brian and I joined us .
did we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rental ?
things came to the rolls .
my former co @-@ inhabitants , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether it could be a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly available photos of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting us .
over the internet , you can invite your alien people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile would burn .
but she did not .
no one who is still very good for comfort would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned all of us , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you mind on things which can be good . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than the appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence by design , among people who had never before ever before .
can design be aff@@ ord something like ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I want to give you a sample of what kind of confidence we aim .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be out of your Com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone on your left seat .
this quiet An@@ flight of pan@@ ic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door .
because the only thing is personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone in your hands ?
most of the responsibility of responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they are different .
only from this reason our company can exist .
only sometimes , who actually has Al Go@@ res mobile now ?
could you declare to Twitter that he is responsible for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
they now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what would be , if we have changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor was first introduced to his name , if he tells , where he is coming , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you have 150 Be@@ ur@@ fs that say all : &quot; he can really take very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system strengthens trust in decisive .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people who have negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest appearances were submitted before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study conducted by Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people trust in one another , according to what they are similar to age and place .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly we trust the people most , which are most similar .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
this is a natural social Vo@@ re@@ flux .
this is exciting if you add to the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three cases , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation with simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots .
in addition , we drove that confidence depends on it , how much to get there .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you say too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer .
one much , how for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- will not be accepted on request .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle &quot; in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing with my family holiday . &quot;
how to create it with design to restore these degrees to op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which topics do you want to write something .
our whole company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages against strangers .
with what we did not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to cancel these advantages .
here you can see how many people will take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a demand that was not covered before .
for us , the shop runs very well .
of course there are times if not all the smooth running .
there were guests that have been celebrated parties or apartments have been devast@@ ated .
we will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls arrived directly on my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing but this calls . it is already hurt when I think only .
the dis@@ appointment that list@@ ens to the voice of the aller , and will always be our biggest motivation to improve ourselves .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , a fra@@ ction of 123 million was only a fra@@ ction each .
for people trusted one another .
when confidence work , we can create marv@@ ell@@ ous works .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay , he suffered a heart attack there .
his host went into hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary surgery !
here is its assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attack on heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real protective gel that save lives , although they don &apos;t know it correctly .
you drive one in your own car , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t want to be lon@@ ely , they bring books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , course not every stay .
but these relationships behind pure money reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
when I met this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of the part fit together with money transactions ?
it comes to economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it just now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Share Economy describes a trading that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if one travels today , it is efficient and reliable with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if journeys would be a rich buffet from local in@@ hibit ?
what if you were interested in any place to wait a group there , a group would wait to fill a thoroughly and to show a very nei@@ x quarter , of which one has never heard ;
or when you can learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed in accordance with the principle of privacy .
what would be , if we would like to make the apartments of reason why ?
how would this look like ?
what if towns would have to take advantage of the common share ?
I present cities , which allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and fl@@ y@@ ott@@ ing@@ ing .
this project has already begun in South Korean capital Seoul , with lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
have now been offered residents . students who were looking for a lead in search of a lead ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were exp@@ elled . incub@@ ators were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy , over 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or a self @-@ host .
the idea seems to be so mad as it was brought to us .
we don &apos;t have invented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
there were already similar websites .
why has just our works ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing we realized that you can find the right design with the existing customers .
design can help us to overcome pro@@ ver@@ root supplies .
I find it amazing ,
just overwhelming .
I have to think about it , when a red Maz@@ da goes on to me .
we know of course that design can not solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you do me ?
a beli@@ ever ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ wear a bra@@ in@@ ing , a terror player ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
that is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the debt for your negative impressions .
so the media people represent , which look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans know my , most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
to all those who have never learned a Muslims : it &apos;s great to know you .
I say you who I am .
I &apos;m a mother , a coffee @-@ operated -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am accused ,
a se@@ al@@ ant @-@ Fitness fan @-@ fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sing , for , baby , I was not born so born .
I decided to have it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ched me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry out Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you feel yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ y was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independence , which I felt like 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ ri@@ ble beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I took with the cor@@ als .
I read it , thought I thought in question , doub@@ ted and believed ultimately .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dev@@ otion that deep@@ ened themselves with any reading of the basket .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k will sometimes bring me to wines .
I know myself about it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that som@@ eb@@ ody wants to perc@@ eive you completely , and but somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and began as all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering .
I was later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then there came a terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember probably exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen at the end , looked at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew to buildings and people out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock related quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do so ?
I moved to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; ... , ... in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; ... Ji@@ hadi@@ sts ... &quot; ...
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country , but in the n@@ u related me the acts of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to go into a new city and start the post@@ graduate course .
I remember , as I felt -- as we were silent -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved in this night in our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the National islam@@ ic organizations that bes@@ ought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well illuminated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not lead you &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed all the week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims are gathering together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go to this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were wor@@ d@@ ently un@@ filtered and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who stayed for Muslims in the Free and struck .
there were really bran@@ dan@@ ces on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something was not felt right .
because people who attacked this land , attacked our land .
I got the rage of people to the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was too angry .
it &apos;s not easy to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can say to people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and exclu@@ des Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my congregation as a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only represents the question : are we bad or ben@@ ch@@ able ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor was removed as a whole and a ben@@ ch@@ ant tum@@ ours only under observation .
alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are Muslims , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but an important organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ s@@ thel@@ e@@ fer and Olympi@@ k .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America to make sure ?
perhaps there will be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to humans other faith toler@@ ant , and bigger citizen participation .
and as a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are not involved in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
at the radio process , it has found that it starts online . as the first it will cut off the person from their community , even by their family , so that the person believes , the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ide@@ ology , is a betra@@ yal or of faith .
if we want to avoid radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group of how the IS had its brood @-@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Muslims , the mother , as humans , I think we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would add to their actions world when you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons in their &quot; holy book . &quot;
but when you cast a look at it , they don &apos;t drive them what they are in the &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brood , which they can read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me a amazing story :
a girl came to him because they regard iniquity to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him whether they have been in touch with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit , having spoken it , brought them to silence , and told her that her anger would bring their sense to un@@ righteousness in the world , that would only bring them in trouble .
of nothing inspired and something similar to their W@@ ut sense , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who spoke to a solution .
this im@@ am set up the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ use them to acc@@ use their wounds , he showed her constru@@ ctive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept before to join the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it work for every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour benefit from fear every day to our democracy , on our thought &apos;s freedom ?
a study - actually , several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ cular studies - show : if we fear , there will happen at least three things .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and advantages .
a study shows : if you report test messages in which neg@@ atively reported to Muslims , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you look when the mood sw@@ ing@@ ing Muslims at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never happens in connection with terrorist attacks .
it came ahead of the war of Iraq and during two elec@@ toral periods .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for man@@ ipulation to be open to the foundation of a free society that have sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear would fall us all .
with the assignment of collective inno@@ cence , it is not only going to declare himself to themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the ad@@ est , most generous man knew whom they knew .
she visited him there and he showed her life . she was bl@@ ossom and said :
&quot; when is such a young man di@@ versi@@ fied from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered in the afternoon , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an which had posted in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , after he posted execution against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot up eight times at De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or stayed at home ?
we see it and for us it was not a slight decision because it was going to leave America to let us leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in whom we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we op@@ ted for the mosque .
we drove the farm with our son in the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes moved out , went into the building hall , and what I looked , left me .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Im@@ am announcement , an announcement , and called our guests welcome , because half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ eist@@ s , believers , and non @-@ believers who were come , not to attack us , but around us .
in that moment I joined together .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion on pan@@ ic and pre@@ disc@@ ern .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of anxi@@ ety and the fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go to number sure ?
you will connect to them that are : we are better than those that are .
thank you .
thank you nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what you say that you may say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a monument with deep thought are working in a noble mind factory , so an exception and not the rule rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t think . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims in all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims in all over the world , people want to normal things .
they want prosper@@ ity for the family , they want work , and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any respect .
if people appear as an exception , then often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , just before that one billion business can be used .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . made possible in research institutes worldwide .
before the aerial view in our social awareness in the Fra@@ c Centre , a autonomous fleet of air@@ machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting you can achieve high speed and acceleration on the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ consuming structures .
they have learned to carry loads with tur@@ bul@@ ences and to react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order to make a system autonomous , it must be collec@@ tively interpre@@ t , where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic T@@ asks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest image e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight machine that tries to beat two flying with a fl@@ ap .
like other starters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the starters , it can be bo@@ red , and so great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ ons is that they react sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ences such as wind b@@ ö@@ s .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight doesn &apos;t matter how the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved .
okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that approach the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , which are exter@@ min@@ ished , to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago , trained pilot @-@ controlled pilots could fly , which had only two moving parts : a propeller and a rear side .
we discovered that flies only works with just one .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically easiest remote control unit . it was invented in front of short .
it only has an event@@ ful part , a propeller ,
no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ sters , no further positions or control surfaces , only a propeller .
although it is mechanically simple , in the inner life seems very much , that it may be stable and can move up in space .
nevertheless , it does not have an elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it properly .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it exactly right when you see all , is small , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed in the evening last night .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ internal is a practice in Gen@@ u@@ gs@@ burg , this machine is here , the om@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the au@@ dit@@ ory ability ,
in the room to move in all directions , no matter what direction he is turned , or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is shown in models that will learn the rest directly at the fly .
let us see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ propeller aircraft .
this is clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
if you build it together , such as a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but there &apos;s something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery - can continue to fly the machine even if restricted .
we will demonstrate that by being able to make a half of flight .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit it with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
every unit white , where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us is the reward in the development and the activity act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it cre@@ atives , cl@@ aws allow them to form a spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential , the dot is on the i .
thank you .
prior to 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ y in a very far distant galax@@ y , they turned into a ten@@ ths of pure energy in a tenth of a tenth deal with pure energy .
for this short moment , they ligh@@ ten@@ ers brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all the galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very great dum@@ my .
but they put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was put into space @-@ time ge@@ aring itself and explo@@ ded the universe in Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us take the events first time .
1.3 billion years ago , it was just a multi@@ zel@@ li@@ ous life originated on the earth .
since then the Earth has brought a lot closer : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God arise , even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly mu@@ ff@@ ness -- R@@ ai Weiss decided by MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about by col@@ li@@ zed black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough humans knew her as a mad gen@@ ius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of decades , design , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ri@@ ot gra@@ vit@@ ational Observatory .
in the subsequent time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could significantly increase significantly , which improved the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some minor , persistent issues .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colored holes were through the earth through the earth .
they went through and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye of my to@@ d@@ go@@ eth father .
basically there were the fruits of my life .
all that which I worked for me is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theore@@ tically physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investig@@ ating Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves in black holes and their through ob@@ servat@@ ories , such as L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is an forces in the wake of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its whole content will be stretched into one direction and into the other hand .
to illustr@@ ative Do@@ z@@ ers lead to the rel@@ ativity on the theory of theory often a really al@@ ber@@ able dance .
&quot; stret@@ chy and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , are di@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , everyone was stretched out on the waves of the waves and stopped . the stretch of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the com@@ ma , followed by 1 . therefore the L@@ IG@@ O collabor@@ ator for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of a radius of a atomic fact . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
described &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt after waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties of building such detectors are massive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but physi@@ cist are inv@@ alid and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O is more than one eye than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than things around us : visual lifts , the size of your mobile phones .
that is quite practical . for example , you can make a picture or map of things by taking it out of several points for you .
in killing , it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very hard to produce a picture of things which mean you especially much :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and level , rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind .
&quot; now Alice speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t produce any simple pictures of objects in all .
but looking forward to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to us their stories .
at least the measured frequencies are available at least for L@@ IG@@ O .
so when we convert wave pattern in sound , we can hear the all literally .
the grav@@ itation is to listen to us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which deals with my colleague Scott already very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , cir@@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very quickly , you hear the same c@@ pen with an additional sound change . listen to : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of motion @-@ making , stamped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14th September 2015 -- a date which at least I never forget -- I heard L@@ IG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ render the sound &#93; J@@ one , who knows what he needs to hear , recognize this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times of solar mass , which are swi@@ ft as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : we are superior to us what does that mean .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 rop@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it , because we have heard it .
this is the lasting meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O p@@ aving a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this way , we can listen to all and hear the invisible .
much in all , we can not see -- practically or basically -- .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why the stars in super nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about all of them .
the exciting physical periods happen in the nu@@ cle@@ us that is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , since they are op@@ ak .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rating iron , when it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the ur@@ king covers his own offspring .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible until the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optim@@ istic , that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen and we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found equally in the first attempt of things that we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the sour cream for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
L@@ IG@@ O enables us a completely different viewing angle to the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of that chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be so cour@@ age@@ ous just as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to builds great detectors and listen to the noise and the roof of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ servat@@ ories -- a completely new generation of ob@@ servat@@ ories on the earth and in all .
for what might be nice to listen to the great cr@@ ushing itself ?
now the time is great dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you .
I tried a experiment before a time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long , I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of whom I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it turned me nerv@@ ous , brought me into un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
wanted I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted I live live in television ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start playing with the Schau@@ mann ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , removed my fear .
my fear to keep spe@@ ech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my sons .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the Klein@@ bl@@ est , calls for all &quot; estim@@ ation , &quot;
when she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; certified , I need milk for my s@@ um@@ bil@@ ical mass . &quot;
she asked them , if I could play with her , when I was just at the leap . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I swear to me always to play with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I always say Yes -- every single times .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I feel very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has a bl@@ ossom tri@@ bution : only recently , I was really good that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen to play my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am writer . I think I guess what you are going to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am an Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I have producer television .
I am TV , in large style .
in this TV season , I &apos;m responsible for this to carry 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production simultaneously .
each programme offers hundreds of jobs that existed before .
the budget for an episode of a television sen@@ ders can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programmes , 70 hours TV , three ship@@ ments , which are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Pot , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created itself , and not only produced , so I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans in bon@@ fires and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , around the world .
do you know who still does it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press it .
I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you , that all of you who do so hard if you &apos;re a company , a land or a class@@ room , to understand that I don &apos;t just say that I &apos;m not just the computer , and it is right when I say : I understand that there is a dream job for dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ ens in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is when I set up troops as a mal@@ ine I was on canvas .
as for dre@@ amed a high sound , lie@@ fs a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that is at the same time .
I love to work it .
it is creative , mechanically , an@@ gled and de@@ pri@@ zed , clin@@ ically , and matern@@ al , cruel and sen@@ su@@ al , cruel and sen@@ su@@ al . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the job runs well .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s hear like a lively street , I could go for ever on her .
many people participate , if I declare unto them the sum@@ s that I write to them that the letter is prepared for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with the TV production , when I began to work and to work , to create and merge , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s of God is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t do differently than size .
the feeling , not different to stri@@ ve , than to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it means a work@@ age to be too .
perhaps it is called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not doing for the failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want it in question .
in order to make a clear : the more succ@@ essive limits , the more episodes , the more periods , the more work is , the more works at the same time , the more watch I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more must work me .
and what did I do about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country , I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , re@@ claimed , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ om is a single job .
Har@@ per tells us : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work anymore . I loved the engine .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no de@@ af , nothing to deleg@@ ate , one Titan sleeps not , aren &apos;t there , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever is always .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a pre@@ show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was I .
so what &apos;s what to do , what to do , the work which I love to do suddenly ?
I know , some say , &quot; Heu@@ le you from , stup@@ id the author Titan . &quot;
but you don &apos;t know what to do , you love what to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you love one another and that &apos;s what the sum@@ s feel , and know how the sum@@ s feel like what the sum@@ s stops , who is one then ?
what are you doing ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart hear , I can survive in silence ?
and then me my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say more than me two things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and second , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when is it happen ?
I hate it , if I am Titan bin and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
and so said they : &quot; m@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and you encounter their sisters , we laugh much and I read all very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; in front of the book .
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum@@ s , I can do nothing to fit out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country , I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exists are st@@ icky fingers and mo@@ ist kiss@@ es , delicate voices , wax p@@ enc@@ ils and the song , in which it goes for lot , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; is released .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
it is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door comes to and an energi@@ zer comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the case .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we forgot .
the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you , who are you if I am you who I am sending me through ship@@ ments and TV hours and how working my brain , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is not strength and it is not unemployed .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from the desire of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ red the pressure of history , which are to do with the anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and originally .
the real sum@@ s of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this for the fixed rule , so that I can rid me as a Work@@ olic of any fault .
it is a law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
don &apos;t play a full way as working .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I am always working , because I love it .
I am rather at the workplace as home .
this in@@ gest@@ ion is painful , because what a man better works than to be home ?
well , yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ est , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too , is none of them .
we were around in the garden around , before and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ushed silk bub@@ bles .
yet I feel greater sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play , till I ask myself : why have we heard with the playing ?
you can also say it ! say it always Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dream .
there you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they make it something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ os@@ fers or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and I speak my te@@ y @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not need .
every one can bring 15 minutes a piece , even at a bad @-@ La@@ une @-@ Day !
15 minutes a piece !
no phone , no clothes , no waste .
the day is short : dinner , the children are finished .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
my children are my well @-@ sensitive , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul peace .
it doesn &apos;t go with the own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I count . friends meet , books read the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education , when I wanted to sur@@ ge myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not be full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s returned to my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return soon , if I don &apos;t work .
work does not work without play .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door open to the energy and I find me again in my office . I hear a well @-@ known mel@@ ody , she meets me and my soul . I will lead me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not ... more .
bubble bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum of the work is part of me but just a part . and therefore I &apos;m so grat@@ eful .
it &apos;s me to see that I am a Titan bin . I never have seen a Titan Poker that plays to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in handle . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happy are I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel good as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I am working .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the tro@@ ut , the high clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the correct sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , relaxing , naked and new feeling in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know what I am .
I am writer . I think I think I raised you to life .
this belongs to the Job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ s have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with the human tragedy every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us , neuro@@ surgery is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious violation of central nerv@@ ous system the patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ sur@@ gin .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerv@@ ous functions through different surgical measures .
certainly they have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; underground @-@ ir@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons , so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that suffered under heavy trem@@ bling and serious pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
we approach to this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with a little help , the brain can help themselves .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading medical doctor and worked in the emergency recovery day and night .
I often served patients with cran@@ ial brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that with cran@@ ial brain trau@@ mat@@ a the brain is gently inclined and the cran@@ ial pressure is rising .
to save the life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
it is sometimes necessary to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this fabric .
this is not a light task .
cells from a tissue increase , it is comparable to all small children that will be taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
that was exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it did Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you can still know from the biological lessons that stem cells are ir@@ mature , which can transform itself into any cell type of organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells stopped different .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ oll@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our native brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the F@@ öt@@ us , they take care of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells , we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language field and then the cells were cultivated exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark the color to track them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the entrance examination of the same individuals .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- auto@@ ot@@ ran@@ transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant@@ ing the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken after some weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so disappear them .
in the second scenario , we opened an injury and im@@ planted exactly the same cells , and now the cells remained to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence showing them are these small points . these are the cells that we found in vitro in the culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop .
help these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual sk@@ ill@@ ity task .
you had to take food from a tablet .
they did it very well .
when they achieved a stable skill level , we missed the mot@@ echn@@ ology range in the motor Cor@@ tex .
the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover yourself at a certain degree , just as in the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side , they see the monkey , who rest@@ art@@ ed spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the m@@ im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results .
since that time we found much more about these cells .
we can freeze and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still alive to im@@ plant@@ ing them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain is the means to heal himself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think , &quot; I know anyone who need it . &quot;
I definitely want .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are , before you can start clinical studies in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : this is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ ate etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to take permission to start the clinical trials . if you look forward to the future , how many years it will take until som@@ eb@@ ody can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of clinical study .
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate it , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
you need to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you tell us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
in the West we make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an un@@ changeable danger .
we believe that capitalism are forced to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have des@@ per@@ ate that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact the democracy comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group - that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not influence the savings programmes that were realized in Greece .
in this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my promised friends who would repeat to me , that the democracy would change anything if they would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce a economic model for real democracy .
I ask you to believe again with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the euro group of a mistake , we could save us the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are common , our future nozzles and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to prove to have interesting contra@@ diction that our taver@@ n are threatened .
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and know him as the Scho@@ den@@ berg , who th@@ rows its long sh@@ adows over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the Scho@@ den@@ berg ,
yet few detect his te@@ d@@ ym@@ us .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the ver@@ itable as@@ par@@ agus and corpor@@ ations , which could be able to invest there , where it would be productive and income if it could produce and all the things that humanity is ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the US , in England and the Eurozone , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth of goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , gear , and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3.4 billion US Dollars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds much money to get it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange and real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital produce the twin peaks that cannot represent by the usual market mechanisms of mechan@@ ics .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , thus ensuring low demand for investors , which could not invest in which they will not invest . just as Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who could not invest in which they could kill him , that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ rolled up the circumstances that lead him that Ö@@ di@@ pus kill him .
this is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
its extremely common Art. All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives and particularly all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form , in which the open and the poor as a majority are control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course too many of --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the job value of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these expres@@ sions .
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they did not only accept the right to free expression , but not only the right to free expression , but important and crucial , that they had the right to maintain political co @-@ determination in question of the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy have not held a long time --
like a candle that illumin@@ ates very bright , it is also quickly developed quickly .
but our current liber@@ als have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy based on Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy only came up as a complete separation between politics and economy and the democratic process was abandoned , while the economy -- thus the world of the corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ cra@@ b @-@ free zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy started , an un@@ inher@@ ent battle between the two instead , the economy slowly wander@@ ed and ma@@ inst@@ ated .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like former ?
it is not on a Deg@@ ener@@ ation of its DNA .
it is that one can be in the government today and nonetheless not in power because the power of politics entered into the economy and the areas are separated .
I chose my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of smo@@ kes , which is so lasting the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that it is therefore hungry for the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that grows to politics as far as far . the power of the corpor@@ ations is growing , political goods are increasing , the economic demand is rising and the management of the corpor@@ ations are waste to invest the cash of their company .
according to the successful capitalism , &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; of democracy distri@@ butes , the higher will be the tw@@ ins summit , and the greater the waste of human labour and prosper@@ ity of mankind .
if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring together the policy and the economy , and it would be better when the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; reserves the control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not survive well .
the doctrine of Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is only repeated by a miracle like in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brood and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it by doing low wages by automation and rob@@ otic system .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will be higher , the fail@@ ures , and social conflicts deeper as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come .
so we need to restore the economy and the economy and politics , and make sure that we can re@@ claim the re@@ unified area , otherwise we will end into a illness @-@ called surveillance @-@ Hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which will appear the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
so the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he will survive .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is affected by a d@@ yst@@ opia similar to &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that the company will serve people and human energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks about the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; should look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; like @-@ like d@@ yst@@ opia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in all of you .
in the company of the company : ask a capital market , where you will earn money , while you are working and in which your capital takes you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you just works -- is property of them that are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and proceeds from funds and the concept of wage work is completely overhau@@ led .
no differentiation between them that are the company , which are not working in it , and employees working there , which the company does not belong . there are no tau@@ x between capital and work , no large le@@ aps between investment and don@@ ors , and ultimately no em@@ por@@ ous tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economics : please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency - we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos , &quot; and every government pays the sum of which the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country is equivalent to a common fund .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es had been proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not necessary to implement the technical resources .
today we have it , particularly in front of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world , which I protect you can be liber@@ alized at the same time , in which they privileged privileged people , and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian , globally ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian .
but over all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
are we awak@@ ening in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we fall into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on it , as we were polit@@ ically polit@@ ically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you gave yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do not know the technological development will produce a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experi@@ encing it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ alization democracy is low .
if this is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as well as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not effective , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation , Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the Red@@ ner you have very clearly said that you keep from the perspective of the West to China .
want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the certificate of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where most of them plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely demo@@ cra@@ b @-@ free zone .
in a certain respect , if I may say that such pro@@ vocation , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- do you remember - we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical , regarding the democratic development .
what you can watch in China , similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now to do that which the West has done to the West in the 19th century , sm@@ ells rapidly after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious to share your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely from the self @-@ counter@@ f@@ le to say goo@@ db@@ ye to the euro@@ zone , a massive re@@ warding line through the Eurozone was , and continues to increase the development of all European Union massi@@ vely .
we had the opportunity to open the first proposal on the basis of Greek &apos;s first proposal -- the way , which den@@ ying this den@@ ying --
it is true to do . unfortunately , the powers have been chosen within the Eurozone , in the Europe group , still den@@ ying den@@ ying .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to receive an economic system that is not super@@ v@@ able to receive through political will and authority , you may have any longer a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : what change do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change their setup .
BG : do you have any mistake in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back at harvest ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in a so cl@@ amped situation , claims that he did not make a mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made errors .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for renewal of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest in the money system to find a joint solution .
but that was not there .
they only wanted to get our government , only because they wanted not to employ with the mer@@ g@@ ings , who ran through the euro zone .
they didn &apos;t want to stand , that they have been cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the Money , who has imposed us this policy : &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ ess error . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive to@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite happy too .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone , which comes from som@@ eb@@ ody who lives and loves .
my greatest fear is that the euro zone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the released fli@@ ppers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we were able to sm@@ ite ourselves the way of a post in 1930 , when it appears to be out , it will also be as well as to the future of the Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope very that you are wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although it is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as a &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content to the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard drive .
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot select any thing .
he must find shows that are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located at the right side of this turn .
this curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating .
will show your show with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive to ad@@ dic@@ tive , your brain asks : &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what to go to that end of the curve .
Roy Price does not manage to do on the left side of the turn , because I don &apos;t need special intelligence to teach &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes himself more thoughts on the average expul@@ sion , the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad , they are simply inspir@@ ing .
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course , it is the first time that Amazon is going to do something , therefore Roy Price wants nothing ris@@ ky .
he wants to create successes .
he needed a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
it takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of this shows and presents them online where you can view it free of charge .
and if Amazon is free to get out things , do you feel right ?
millions of spectators look at this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed at the watch of this shows .
they will be watching by Roy and his team to record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed that parts you ski@@ ps or look again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data then you should produce which show them .
in fact , they process the data , process and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ Com for four Republi@@ can US transmitters . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good .
it is just an average show -- on the meaning of the word -- since the average of this turn is 7.4 and Alpha House rose above average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company , another manager has been placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program creation of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy , he is always on the search to find this a super @-@ show and he is using data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team looked forward to the existing information about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give the shows , the course of which shows them like etc .
then use these data to find this small details on the audience : what shows them like the producer , what actor .
when they had all the parts , they entered a wagon , and decided to make a Sit@@ Com for four transmitters , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating based on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happens here ?
one has two very competent , data di@@ versi@@ fied .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic states that this should work in all .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that meets it , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computer .
the min@@ est thing you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis is not working so , this is something terri@@ fying because we are living in a time , in which we are more and more about statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes in contact with this software . come in contact with this software , you are in jail .
if anyone asks here in the US in prison and for release , it is likely to determine whether the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than to decide whether a show is good or bad , it will be decided whether a person is good or bad .
medium TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not sure that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of di@@ versi@@ fied companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mist@@ akes bugs .
in 2009 , Google announced that they may have been prec@@ eded by data analysis of flu , the worst type , predic@@ ting -- through data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news of news . the success gi@@ fted in a publication in the &quot; Nature &quot; magazine .
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the &quot; Nature &quot; magazine .
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google don &apos;t understand anything .
despite all these mist@@ akes , data came to the decisions of life a -- on the workplace , in the legal entity , in medicine .
thus , we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based Genet@@ ics -- an area where some very cle@@ ver people use un@@ imagin@@ able people to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ sem@@ inated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , they mainly do two things :
as a first , put this problem in its individual parts , so that you can analyze individual parts ; as a second place you put the components together to hold a dis@@ connection .
sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and assemble again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , you can help to break a problem and to understand his parts .
they are not suitable to add the parts again and then to a dis@@ connection .
there is another tool and we are all : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is in@@ complete , even if the information is in@@ complete , especially when it is the brain of a expert .
therefore , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
you can use data to understand their audience better , why they would not have been unable , but the decision to put all these parts , again and make it a show as &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
and Amazon did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas when they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the decisions for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is aston@@ ishing . for decisions by a J@@ a- or no @-@ question you will need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will run it later with a technical demo .
so far , I met some decisions in my life , where I had to hear the ball in the afternoon .
but , as you know of course if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a lot of exc@@ els , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not have the basic body .
so , perhaps the ball che@@ er and kl@@ ü@@ ger . ultimately it &apos;s to make decisions on us if we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right turn .
and I can try this as very encour@@ aging message that it still pays off despite the great amount of data still paid , decisions to be an expert in that which you do , and risks .
because at the end it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
