<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him, because he won as a New York Times reporter for the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard from Edward Snowden, Risen a book written in which he was spectacular that the NSA had illegally heard of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence service in which the CIA literally called for a atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know that the chapter was not pleased?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government was determined against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became the symbol of the government to condemn Whistleblower and journalists to discuss journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media cannot get these information, and if they do not protect the identity of the mule that they are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government of Risen, he did something that many brave Reporter already did before him: he refused, and he said that he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived so with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were many times that it would have been indispensable for their case, the claims of the government were dropped to risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and rust to bring statements, it could also be able to do with its digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigations, without his incomprehension, worried about his own telephone,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its lending service, and even travel instructions with list of flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and cracks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, it is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistlebell. but instead, the judiciary has more convicted than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem especially because the government is too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since the 11th of September, almost every article about National Security was the outcome of what a Whistlebell went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the press work on the game that will be protected by the first constitutionality, because the government has always has more possibilities to maintain all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But as the technology of the government permits to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And although they can take it from the moment, in which they can contact, instead of the follow-in, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that has not yet been written as Risen his book, and it is much more safe as normal emails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous, which was developed by us from the previous Aaron Swartz, and is now been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been developed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the relevant News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, the government cannot explain any more information secretly, and many of the information that would like to request would be not available in advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is just a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are always new spionagettechnologies that are all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is necessary to ensure that not only technology managers such as Edward Snowden has a possibility to do abatas. it is the same that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about abuse during the supply of soldiers and overfilled hospitals. or to the next environmental workers, the alarm to the sighing water of Flint. or a gelstreet-Insider which warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">At all these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data leck of the story was released.] [the "Panama Papers" was hidden that the rich and Mighty] have been hidden by Global Witness to a declaration.] this week we were talking about an Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister is back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an associate of brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad briefenfirms in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin takes over a narrow friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, waiting for the next publication, and to the next unched documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping away from you, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we use what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty in the location are able to store your fortune in tax phases and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these abstentions are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret control phases of some few, their fortune to hide and swallow -- something that we have been discussing and unveil for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appear very confusing this whole world, and it is difficult to understand how these control phases work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always look like a Matrjoschkapuppe in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can really be difficult for criminal prosecution and tax agencies, as well as for journalists or civil society.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there have been no known American Americans that came to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there is no rich Americans who hide your fortune in tax phases.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which these control phases work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have links to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need to specify less information in some US states to form a company than to get a library document.</seg>
<seg id="68">This species of intransparent in the US has allowed employees to capture school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed actuator, particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior which affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigations were as an African minister, who wanted to bring suspects money into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all up to an advocate of our investigators, how he could transfering his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all occurrences. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to the money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single slope.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who understandeth investigator suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top pole, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's how the system works through the corruption, control currant, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to handle this, we must change the game rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">I like anything very trendangered, as if we could do anything against it; as if nothing ever had changed, it is always the rich and mighty one.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a recovered optimal, I see that a lot has to change too.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years, we have seen how to read more transparency about the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been recorded in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US has left back here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this makes not the progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama Contents, this huge insight into the world of the tax is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in business to stand and say: "intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians to recognize the problem and to do it, through laws this type of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finish the intransparent, which now allows this type of control curses, corruption and money launderwear, finally finish.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I had almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk room of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a backstage sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stayed and looked on my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a road journey through the whole country. thereafter he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made him to ask him: "where do you sleep today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleep now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just knew him! he says he would not go to peace, but I don't know if he is really planning. I'm not kidnapped in the boot room of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me," "" "I have air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "h, how please?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">Night I was in bed, I starred to the blanket and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken up?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildland sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on tiff-pointed to the door, and my bedroom door has closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my eye-angle completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered on it?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was to accommodate myself, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Do we make a short jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I knew that there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, creativity can make it to transform and transform into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I heard how we could earn something like this. our apartment is coming to a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WiFi and a desk, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the airmattresses on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to taste our cheese ham Omelet, completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We stayed with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, stared Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rental?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-inhabitants, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out how to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website, on the people publicly shown images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, the kind of rooms, whose doors is coming when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, they can invite our foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did it not do.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that is not allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can see on things that can be good. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to develop objects, but now we wanted to create through design, which never before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be so something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample sample, which are the degree of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your compilation.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I like to make your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock mobile phone your left seating.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what the host will open when she opened the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocking mobile phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests feel that they may stay differently.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">So, who has now actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare on Twitter for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we would have changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have been presented only once with his name; if he had told, where he comes, how his dog or his children will be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 assessments that they all say: "he can really unlock mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you want to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-established feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to drop negative reference departments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had to be submitted, before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We performed with Stanford a study. we examined, as probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are similar to the age and residential location.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most, who are similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social Voreingenuity.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But it has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep root preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that trust depends on how much one of them is cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the response to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you're talking about little, like" Hi! "you don't get any answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">It is too much, as for example: "I have trouble with my mother" -- -- the request will not be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree in Openness, such as "Tolls of art in your apartment! I'm doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to produce this degree?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which you should write anything.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages compared to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">As we had not counted, the great amount of people who were more than ready to have this preconception.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times, if not all the smooth running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are allowed to celebrate parties or apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it does already hurt when I think only.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointments that hearings in the voice of the Anrufer, was and always our greatest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, a fraction of 123 million people had only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence works, it can be wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to cardiac activities because of sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protective gel that save lives, although they don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="218">You ride a car in the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">"" "" "" "because they don't want to feel at that time, they bring books over." ""</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, of course, it does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure banknotes are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I was proud of this term, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of the subsidy fit together with money actions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it's just called" "" "rental industry" "", "it is not just to be justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People create a part of themselves, and that changes all.</seg>
<seg id="230">If one travels nowadays, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would you be to express a rich buffet from local currency?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit to wait a group there, would have a thoroughly replenish and to show a baseline quarter, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you can learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed in privacy after the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would we be, if we would like to make apartments of the ground?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would happen if cities would have the shared share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I spend some cities that allow us society and relations took place, instead of loneliness and decelery.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, this project has already begun. many parking lots, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">They were now offered themselves. students who were looking for a lead in search of a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were killed by people whose children were taken out. were incubator programmes started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, there are 785 000 people in 191 countries to be guest at a stranger or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why does it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">In addition to luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep parts.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that blossom,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time when a red Mazda passes over me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself what we can use it soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, underunderwear a brain underwear?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay while security holes at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So we represent the media that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of coverage above Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans are mine, most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never learned a Muslims: it is great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-powered -- double Espresso, with whipped cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am diverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealthiegs-Fitness fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslims min.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, for, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have decided.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ouched me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslims min. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friendship was horrified:" "" "why do you suppressed yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusty was: at that time it was for me a feminist independence of Independence, and over the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old felt me to adapt me a perfect and integrity.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, thought in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion to deepen with each reading of the corans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik brings me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel the feeling that someone takes you really understands, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began as all of the good Egyptians, my career as engineering in engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the Egyptian American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen in my kitchen, looked at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "Eil."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircrafts in buildings, people spouses from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned fast in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I changed the TV channel and heard:" "" "Muslim terrorists..." "" "in the name of Islam..." ""... "" ""... "" ""..., "" "" broken Mecca! "" "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only attacked my country, but in the Nu turned me the works of others from a civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to go through the U.S. West to the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I was silent -- as we were silent - so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved in this night into our apartment, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, when I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations which said: "be careful," Be careful, "" "" Be careful, "" "" "" "" lead you not in well-illuminated "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gathered to gather together.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were prudingly unusual and I heard of attacks on Muslims, or of people who stayed for Muslims, in the Free and defeated.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really Branch on Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something feeling not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this land have attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the rage of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing about questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is just the question: we are malicious or spicious?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a benchant tumor was just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are as all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, helpers and Olympionians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques of America make secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a couple of parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and larger civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in the Washington region, DC recently told: people will not be radicalised in Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radiated in their cellars or bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the Radical process has found that it starts online. as the first, the person is cut off from their family, so that the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists shall be true Muslims, and everyone who abhates their behaviour and ideology.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to keep people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS had its brood with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslims, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would be able to add to us into their suburbs, if you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS have so much to do so much with Islam, like the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you cast a look at them, they don't drive what they are in their" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their breeding ality that they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because it was the place to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit that had spoken to silence, she brought her to silence, and told her that her wrath was for unrighteousness in the world, they would only bring it into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">From nothing inspired and something that had given the sense of their rage, she was a major destination for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam presented the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse for their rage, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, keep it before the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy, on our idea?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientists studies -- show: if we fear we will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and preconception.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one reports test individuals who have been reported negative in Muslims, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only one academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the tuning of Muslims went up with Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the preparation of the war of Iraq and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction on Moslem terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation public to identify the foundation of a free society that sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We perhaps feel it as first, but the toxic air of fear shes us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">For the assignment of collective debt, it is not just to declare themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental Faculty, talented, promising a lot of...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the adest, a most generous man, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her his life. she was blossom and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a diversified young man made of my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne during her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was born in the afternoon as soon as he was postponed against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism cannot be only unmoralish but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We had no light decision, for it was not a light decision because we would like to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in whom we can freely practise our religion free.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to build us for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the kindergarten we drove silent, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the building hall, and what I looked to keep myself.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was filled restless.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then, the Immediator made an announcement, and called our guests welcome, for half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who were come, not to attack us, but to stand us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I am broken.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had been courage and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and Fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will connect to those that are: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you might claim a TEDTalk to work a monument with draught, so an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't know. I'm totally normal.</seg>

<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look to Muslims on all over the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted research on all over the world, people want to be normal things.</seg>

<seg id="404">So I am not an exception.</seg>

<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Basters, just before to become a one billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats. this is possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-package in our social awareness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft engines in the Frac Centre has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with them.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting gear units high speed and acceleration on the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-adhesive structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulences and to react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of Possible Flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">This means a system autonom works, it has to know collective praises where space objects are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tissues.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localising technology by Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest Ebene. g." "" "and" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine tries to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the backward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most powerful cases it can be sulphur, and it has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a miter page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgeons is that they react sensitive to turbulences such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't matter in which location the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often provide basic abstract questions regarding the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts, which collects themselves to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Prior to decades, the pilots could fly remote-controlled flight devices that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a hedgeons.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently, we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has an eventful part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No sounds, hinges and Querruder, no further positions or controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although there is mechanically simple but happens in the inner life very much, that it can be stable and can easily move in the space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have an elegant algorithm of the stern. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it right, if all look on, is low, that's why I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is a exercise in combulation, this machine is here if the headphone with its eight propellers, a exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is equivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way, he gets the audulent skill skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">In all directions in all directions, it doesn't matter what direction he is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is visible in models, the rest is learns directly to flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see this.</seg>
<seg id="451">If you want to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a little bit-called -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even though.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this that we make a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic schip.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit them with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit is white, where in the space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as it would like to be a flying lamp screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of these technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the reward in the development and the process of work.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it is creative, scoop creatures allowed to form it in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the bag is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are always faster, you walk to the mass of three nuns in a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lightens her brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not expose their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time poems and the universe exploded in Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events initially temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="476">At 1.3 billion years ago, multilingual life was created on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has undergone a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God understand us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of very brave -- Rai Weiss decided by MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for Gravitational waves, which arise about colonized black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held it for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people knew it as a mad genies, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser Interferometry-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time the precision of LIGO was significantly increased, which improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore you call him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run by some smaller, persistent problems to clarify.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collified black holes through the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my todsick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruits of my life was.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked for me is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and collective Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. it has been investigated for 23 years of gravitational waves of black holes and their observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a forces in the face of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the front of the wave, the space and its entire contents will be stretched into one direction and the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, Dozers perform a really albering dance in Kursen for Relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretchy and dust, stretchy and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitational waves are extremely weak, even smiling.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, everyone was stretched out by us when the waves of the waves and the elongation of an average people was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 Nullen after the Komma, followed by a 1. therefore, the LIGO employees explained for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, and this is already absurd, it would have to be measured in less than a thousandths of a radius of a nuclear power. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting after the waves: "the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are mighty.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicist are finalist and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claimed, LIGO is more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to declare what means that.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facars, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite convenient. for so, you can get a picture or a map of things to take advantage of several points for you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce an image of things that mean you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and volume, rhythm and volume to close to the history behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice" says.</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is true for Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't have any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But having regard to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to us their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least the measured frequencies are at least for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">When we convert wave pattern to sound, we can listen to all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation is to listen to us about collision of two black holes so my colleague Scott has already been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, Zirpen simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, one hears the same circus with an additional sound. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion set, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that I never forget to hear -- heard LIGO the following: [surrender Spusch], knows this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass which are about as fast as the bars of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior to us what means that.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 ropes, the other with a mass of 36 tons, revolve each one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it, because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can not see -- practically or generally --.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why the same stars explode supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned much about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">However, the exciting physical benefits are done in the core, which is behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. the urgnment: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe but we will never see since the urgnment is covered by its own neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important: I'm optimistic that we have never seen in all things we never see, which we never see, and of whom we don't have any idea. things we are just to discover by listening to us.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found equal in the first attack things we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the Saurierky for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to have a completely different angles on the events of all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as good as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time of great dreams come.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year I would say to all "Yes!" I was afraid of whom I feared.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it was nervous to tell me in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the play?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, and fear my fears.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fears to keep words, my social fear -- Puff, gone away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, who changed my life to an unexpectedly art. it began with a question of my Kleinsts.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the Kleinste, calls for unexplained reasons, "</seg>

<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her, when I was just on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from here I swear to play always with them as soon as you're going to do with them. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I always say Yes -- each individual times.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I should meet me very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only before short, I actually knew that the "Yes" would be saved to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think of things you prefer to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I create television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing TV, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I'm responsible for that 70 hours of programme into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each consignment provides hundreds of jobs that previously existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a television channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode of nine days, four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programmes, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, the same time in production are four episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With The Catch, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In the Americas my TV series run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series will run in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shipments that I have created themselves, and not only produced, so still obsolving, creative time to gather my fans to campfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, which burn around the world.</seg>

<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you are doing so hard, if you say a company, a land or a household, you can understand that I don't want to understand that I am not only about the computer, and it is true if I say: I understand that there is not a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">Everything is a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened to work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set up troops, I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dreaming man a high sound, lieve a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, anstrenous and deprived, clinical and maternal, clinically and sensual, fierce and sensible. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">One sums starts in my head, and it grows, and it grows, and the sums listens like a busy street, I could always go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate if I declare to them the sums that I'm talking about that the writing is preparing to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I started working with the TV production when I began to work and to work, to create and merge, I discovered this thing to create this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a sums, then you can't beat any other than the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not unlike size, no matter how to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps there is also a Workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for the failure, and I know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I want to tell you, I am a titanium, and I know that I will not ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: ever since more information, the more bulations, more overcome borders, the more work is, the more things at the same time, the more things I see, more, I write the story so much more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more must work me.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the screen, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums. I am the sums.</seg>

<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is an only work institute.</seg>

<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, working weekends, no Reue, nothing to delegate, one Titan sleeps not, gives not on, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-showing-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I didn't have fun any more.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes you doing what you do, the work that you love, suddenly blamed?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may remember: "Heul you, blazing the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what you are doing, one loves you will love one teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that gives the sums to know how to stop the sums when the sums stop, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states-winery in" "" "is a question." ""</seg>

<seg id="677">I hate it when I am Titan bin and my sums, and here all changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so says it: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and like their sisters, we laugh much and I read out very dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the sums, I can do nothing but to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I'm focus.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists, sticky fingers and mock kisses, delicate voices, watchstrap, and song, in which it comes to lot, or whatever the girl is in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy switch comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel that I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay at the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the workmen, the worms, which is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you, if I am asking you who am I, if I choose from the broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, who comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignored the pressure of history, which to do difying tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The genuine sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered me the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child will play with me, I will tell Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm going to be fixed, so that I can rid me as a Workaholic of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">They don't play ansatin, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This ingestion is painful, for what a man is better than to be home to house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rases in the garden around, and back, and go back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grind soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always looked after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask: why have we ever heard with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! say they always yes, if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me for naiv, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">Then you have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me until they get something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="767">The sums came back in my leisure time. the sums seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work not working without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door open to the energy, and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she met me and my soul. she forwards me to new ideas. I use it in full brewing and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums but I love it not.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>

<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgin.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very small ability to help selfancy.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgery?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor attempting to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard from one of the most well-known, "deep-irstimulation." it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons that improves neurologic function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an astonishing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered under severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation means not Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">We approach our dream to this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading upper physician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often delivered patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumata, the brain relapt and the cranial pressure is tilted.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you need to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">It must be removed sometimes a part of the cranial mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue grow to grow, comparable to all small children, which are out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was able to do.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biographies that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They looked slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So, we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but felt different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Douballerortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the Fötus, they take care of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of brain, since we find them in higher concentrations near brain violations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, a matter is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain mass from non-language areas and then remove the cells exactly as cultured as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark colouring to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the edge of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotrantransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in the brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they were returned after some weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a violation and reimplanted the same cells, and now the cells remained to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show them are these little points. these are the cells that we disbanded in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we couldn't stop of course.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual loading job.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take animal pellets of one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable dexterity level, we last in the motor cortex of the hand motoriic range.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they relaxing spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brains. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, which relied spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can deliver about 40% to 50% of its original performance.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the friction plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can invite you to freezing and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them to other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still going to implanted it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope to show you soon as the human brain gives you to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely be sure.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are, before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to the start of clinical trials. if you look forward to the future, how many years it takes to come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first show that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every one.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West we make a big mistake to view it as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unaltered gearing.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its huge imitators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy in Europe vanishes us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmissable that the democratic process of our country - our elections -- not affect the savings programs that have been realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my recorded friends who would repeat me, if the democracy would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I want to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe it with me again, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of error, we could save democracy, but we could need to save democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our companies are red, our future jets and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of vanishing, I would like to prove you at an interesting contradiction which currently our inn are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it" "" "twins" "" "twins-Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and know him as the Schodenberg that throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schodenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his diymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is one of unused austerity and corporations, which could have to invest there, where it would be productive and income, with whom you might produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example "green" energy. "</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and the Eurozone, a total of 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested, in all the wealth produced goods, such as industrial facilities, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars will sound according to a lot of money, until it is equivalent to the same time in the same country and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange rates and real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and productive capital form the twins of twins that do not mean by the usual market mechanisms of mechanics.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, such as Ödipus Father, who could not invest in whom they could not invest, that his son would kill him if he grow to grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances that lead him to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "its extremely mersible Art. All the unproductive capital should be used to develop our life and develop particularly all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we proceed: what do we understand?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a social form, in which the Free and the poor is the majority of the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the athenic democracy finished many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to decrease the importance of athenic democracy due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the athenical democracy was and is that they did not have the working poor, but important and crucial, which they have the right to set up the right to political participation with equal voting rights in questions of state pliers.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy didn't have long kept --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is too fast.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today liberal democracy would not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenic democracy focused on free citizens, and the working poor is based, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">Because the liberal democracy came up only when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was adjusted to politics, during the economy -- so the world of the corporations -- a democrationefree zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present Democrats since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an uninherent fight between the two, the economy gradually emigrated to politics and dismaze them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are not more so far as earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not an Degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is that one can be today in the government today and yet do not believe in power because the power of politics into the economy are secluded and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I chose my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about such as a flock of prey, which are so sustainable the animals, of which they feed themselves, decimated that they are hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy, which grows so far from the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the concert is growing, political goods is growing, economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are to invest, the cash of their companies are investing.</seg>
<seg id="948">According to the success of capitalism, "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher will be the twins of human labour, and so much higher the waste of human rights and welfare of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is right, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better when the "demos" control to control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea about 100 years ago and it was not strange good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor is to recover through a miracle like in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of breeding and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to make the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it to replace low-wage-employed by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, such a long economy and politics separate areas, the automation is higher, and the social conflicts can be higher, like it -- already very soon as I think - in countries such as China is coming.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to combine the economy and policies to unite the economic situation and politics, so we will make sure that we will be democratically democratically elected in a heart rate monitoring Hyperautocracy which can appear in the movie "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not so whether the capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements that he has brought forth --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether to be replaced by a Dystopia, similar to those in "Star Trek", or similar to those of the society in "Star Trek", or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians Agora, "in long talks the sense of life framing.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what else could it look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital is going to take you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one has just worked -- is ownership of those who work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and investments are completely overhauled and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who are the company belong to work, but employees who work there, but the company does not have to work there. no taurine more between capital and work, no big gaps between investment and spans, and ultimately no one-porous twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is traded -- we call them "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the respective country to a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invested in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment charges are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically the fact that John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one had not the technical resources at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, in particular, we have, especially in front of the background of a restored policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I decide to you, is more liberal, in which they preferred privileged people, and marxistic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fall into a "Matrix" - similar dystopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You will defend yourself in your biography as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything from what I have just said, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do we do that's technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall demand, as Larry summers known as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By the transfer of this crisis of one part of the earth to the next, as we are currently living, it is not only our Democrats destabilize, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is definitely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise as Hayek, so I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you think not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical declaration -- YV: actually it was Einstein that told it. BG: in your presentation, Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you have said clearly said what you have to keep from the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most of it is abyss, -- the area of economy -- a totally democrationefree zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain regard, if I may tell the provocation, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- that's a mistake, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberale, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptic that affects the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can now watch in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "China is now to do this to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells amazing to hypocrisy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious about your experiences as a financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I think that it comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back to the first half of months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, in fact, to say goodbye to the subject of self-awareness that a massive displacement line through the euro zone, and continues to continue the development of the entire European Union massively.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to go on the basis of the Greek prefecture -- by the way, the first suggestion of this denying --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately it is right. unfortunately the powers are within the Eurozone, within the European group, continue to denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries an economic system that is not able to get the life through political will and authitarism, you may have any longer a while, but if the change occurs, it is abrupt and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any error in your time as a financial minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister for Finance, or any minister after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation, claims that he didn't have any error, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honest interest on pages of money to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring out our government, only because they wanted to deal with the agreements that ran through the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand that she has been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one out of the Troika of the money, who puts us this policy: "this was a Colombian mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all, and despite the aggressive Tons of conversations, you seem to be quite pretty per European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, from somebody who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for if they do not survive, the emetzals will be forced to destroy and destroy the European Union." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">When we propose ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, it will also appear to me as well as for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard of Roy Price, although it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that met Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes herself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows, shows the shows and content to the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't select any way.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are entitled to show this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" Breaking Bad "" "" Game of Thrones, "" "" The Wire "-- all the shows how to make a season, your brain asks:" "" "where are there any more of these episodes?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This sort of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that's what you should say in this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle output, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they are unable to inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something so that why doesn't want to risk Roy Price.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He participates many ideas for TV shows and chooses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and present them online where they can watch them free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon exists for free things, you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you are pauses, which parts is skipped or once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide on these data we should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, these and this is the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a SitCom for four republican U.S. Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do anyone knows the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of these show can remember, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- i.e. something about average, but not just that of what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time, another manager has a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. exactly like Roy is always on the search to find this a super show and also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a contest, he and his team will be the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, shows the shows, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these small details about the audience: what shows they like what actors, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went up a car and decided to make a SitCom over four transmitters, but a drama-series on a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this curve. thus exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data and experienced firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision to meet you, then one should meet a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect, is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, then this is something terrifying because we live in a time, in which we are more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in contact with this software. come in contact with this software, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If any one asks here in the US in prison and to release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results will not always be generated. this is not aware that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the facts are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes sometimes error.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is due to data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worst species, predictions -- due to data analysis of the Google-research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It functioned wonderful and was a great news position. the success in a publication in the magazine "Nature".</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year round about year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the publication of the publication in Nature "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data are missing companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data flows in decisions of life a -- on the workplace, in case of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based Genetics -- an area where some very smart people are unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. about the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and non-successful decisions. this pattern should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you solve a complex problem, you do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As first, put this problem into its individual parts, so that you can analyse the single parts; as a second place you set the components to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to understand a problem and understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to enforce the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is uncomplete, in order to hold a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of a experts.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, was Netflix as successful because they have data and understanding where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You will use data to understand their audience better, why not have been able to understand how to take all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which stood not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, making it a great risk of personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">On the other, Amazon did so on the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">You use data to control all their decisions, first when they chose TV ideas, then they selected "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they say to us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think that things are wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and in order to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it's also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". it is amazing. for decisions made with a ja- or no question you need to shake the ball to get an answer. "" "" highly likely "-- exactly here in this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will get it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I've met some decisions in my life, whereby I should hear the ball in the night.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace these by something much triggering, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball clüger and clüger. finally, it's thought to meet decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I can see this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paid out, decisions made to be an expert in which we do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data but the risks where you cross the right at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
